We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of single-dose i.v. ketamine augmentation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Thirty outpatients with severe MDD (17-item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score ⩾ 24) were randomized to 4 weeks double-blind treatment with escitalopram 10 mg/day+single-dose i.v. ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) or escitalopram 10 mg/day + placebo (0.9% i.v. saline).

PTSD causes a significant burden on healthcare workers and victims' families. The US Food Drug Administration (FDA) has approved only two Serotonin Selective Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRI), sertraline, and paroxetine as pharmacological interventions for PTSD. SSRI has a 50-60% response rate and up to 30% remission rate with a high relapse rate. Ketamine is an NMDA receptor blocker, has a rapid effective onset, a potent antidepressant with anti-suicidal, neuroprotective, and cognitive-enhancement properties. METHOD: We retrieved randomized clinical trials (RCT) on PubMed, PubMed Central, and Medline Database of clinical trial studies until Jan/2022. We used the following keywords: \"posttraumatic stress disorder. \"AND \"Ketamine.\" AND \"Esketamine\" AND \"NMDA receptor antagonist\" AND \"treatment, pharmacological intervention, management. \". We used Medical Subject Heading [Mesh] Term for \"ketamine\" and \"Esketamine\" And \"Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate\" and \"Stress Disorders, Post-Traumatic\" and \"Disease management.\". RESULT: All qualified five randomized clinical studies showed rapid and clear benefits of Ketamine infusion for PTSD symptoms resistant to conventional medications. The clinical improvements were evident in three of the four PTSD symptom categories, intrusions, avoidance, and negative alterations in cognitions and mood. In addition, Ketamine administration was safe well-tolerated, with transient dissociation as the main side effect reported. Ketamine infusion also positively affects comorbidities like chronic pain, alcohol use disorder, and major depression. CONCLUSION: Ketamine showed fast, safe, highly effective pharmaceutical intervention for chronic PTSD symptoms. No correlation between ketamine potency and patient age, sex and/or body mass index.

This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.", "doi": "10.1002/da.20297", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17345601/", "secondary_title": "Depression and Anxiety", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive peroral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magneticresonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration.

In Switzerland, MDMA and congeners are ‐ after cannabis and cocaine ‐ number three in the ranking of the most popular illicit drugs. Worldwide, Ecstasy is estimated to be even the second most popular illicit drug, used by millions of regular users. On the basis of animal data, it is likely that MDMA at high or cumulative doses damages serotonin (5‐HT) neurons in the human brain. However, because of a multitude of methodological problems and a limited number of studies conducted in human subjects, no firm conclusions can yet be established whether chronic MDMA exposure produces a long lasting 5‐HT deficiency syndrome, with consequent neuropsychiatric risks. To further address the putative neurotoxicity of MDMA in the human brain, we propose that novel functional assays of serotonergic neurotransmission may be useful to clarify this issue. We suggest that a 5‐HT challenge study using positron emission tomography (PET) in conjunction with the 5‐HT releaser dexfenfluramine [(+)FEN] may test the functional integrity of the 5‐HT system in the living human brain. Specifically, in a placebo‐controlled study, the 5‐HT release capacity of serotonergic neurons shall be investigated by assessing [18F]‐altanserin binding to 5‐HT2A receptors following (+)FEN challenge in former and continuing MDMA users, and age and sex‐matched MDMA‐naïve controls. (+)FEN is a potent serotonin releaser without relevant affinity for 5‐HT, dopamine (DA) or norepinephrine (NE) receptors, and devoid of acute adverse effects in man. This makes (+)FEN an ideal pharmacological probe to explore functional integrity of serotonin neurotransmission. A second aim of our investigation is to detect possible impairments of cognitive functions and to study their relationship to serotonin neurotransmission as indexed by PET. In the course of the neuroimaging study, the investigators therefore also measure cognitive (e.g. attention, visual and working memory, learning, executive function) and affective functions (e.g. anxiety, impulsivity), suspected to be altered due to chronic MDMA use. Using correlational analyses, the investigators aim to determine if circumscribed regions of altered 5‐HT function are associated with specific impairments in cognitive and/or behavioural parameters. We hypothesize that (+)FEN‐evoked 5‐HT release will discernibly alter availability of 5‐HT2A receptors to [18F]‐altanserin, with a pattern revealing the spatially heterogeneous vulnerability of 5‐HT innervations to MDMA. The investigators predict that [18F]‐altanserin volume of distribution (DV) will decline following (+)FEN challenge to a lesser extent in current MDMA users compared to MDMA‐naïve control subjects. On the basis of animal data and recent neuroimaging studies in humans, the investigators hypothesize that functional recovery in former MDMA users will be manifest by a normalization or overshoot of the 5‐HT release capacity. Our methodology will allow us to quantitatively assess serotonergic functions in the living human brain. The novel combination of (+)FEN‐induced release of 5‐HT from intracellular storage vesicles and subsequent PET assessment of competitively altered [18F]‐altanserin binding at postsynaptic 5‐HT2A receptors will provide a more direct biological marker of in vivo serotonin function than has been hitherto available. By applying this new pharmacological challenge/PET neuroimaging approach to groups of current and former users of MDMA, the investigators shall be able to gain important new insight in the debated functional consequences of MDMA use, especially concerning the controversy about the reversibility of 5‐HT changes following cessation of MDMA use.

Limited previous studies indicated profound changes in functional connectivity of resting state networks after the administration of LSD. The current investigation attempts to replicate and extend those findings in an independent sample. In a double-blind, randomized, cross-over study, 100 μg LSD and placebo were orally administered to 20 healthy participants. Resting state brain activity was assessed by functional magnetic resonance imaging. Within-network and between-network connectivity measures of ten established resting state networks were compared between drug conditions. Complementary analysis were conducted using resting state networks as sources in seed-to-voxel analyses. Acute LSD administration significantly decreased functional connectivity within visual, sensorimotor and auditory networks and the default mode network.

Ketamine agumentation of ECT requires further exploration in well-designed studies with adequate sample size. The short-lived antidepressant effect of Ketamine is a potential limitation, therefore, further studies administering multiple infusions for acute treatment and maintenance are necessary.", "doi": "10.1007/s11126-020-09830-6", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32852658/", "secondary_title": "Psychiatr Q", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

At present, pharmacists receive minimal training on psilocybin, and little is known about their attitudes toward its use for medical purposes. Findings from recent clinical studies have attempted to establish the safety and medical efficacy of psilocybin, leading to an increased interest in therapeutic psilocybin use in the United States. This study aimed to assess if self-assessed knowledge of psilocybin, concerns about adverse effects, and opinions about legalization will make statistically significant contributions to pharmacy students' attitudes about psilocybin use in practice. Methods Pharmacy students' self-assessed knowledge, concern for potential adverse effects, and perceptions of psilocybin were investigated using a cross-sectional survey study design. Data were collected from March 13 to April 7, 2023, from a convenience sample of 161 pharmacy students enrolled in an accredited pharmacy school in the southern region of the United States using a 41-item anonymous quantitative survey developed by the researchers that contained validated scales. The survey was delivered electronically. Multiple regression modeling was conducted to determine if self-assessed knowledge, concerns for adverse effects, and opinions about legalization would predict pharmacy students' attitudes about therapy-assisted psilocybin use.

CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects.

Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. RESULTS: We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment of TRD with psychotic symptoms with esketamine administered subcutaneously. Ketamine has been used to induce a pharmacological model of psychosis, because it produces a syndrome consisting of disordered thought, perceptual abnormalities, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and memory impairments in healthy subjects. Because of that, nearly all clinical and research protocols have used the presence of psychotic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for treatment with ketamine. However, different sources of evidence have suggested that psychotic manifestations associated with ketamine are transient and clinically non significant. Although ketamine has significant perceptual effects, they are transient and usually occur at higher doses than those necessary for depression treatment. In addition, the findings of the present study are in line with previous studies reporting remission of both depressive and psychotic symptoms after treatment of patients with depression and acute psychosis or a history of psychosis. Moreover, studies examining patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern of psychotomimetic manifestations following low-dose ketamine administration. Notably, they experienced mild, short-lasting increases in psychotic symptoms, but these had no impact on the longterm outcome of these patients with psychosis. As previously suggested, inclusion of patients with psychotic depression in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine should be encouraged.

The results are consistent with previous findings indicating central axes of the psychedelic experience, and may inform therapeutic approaches using ayahuasca.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-44193-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37949934/", "secondary_title": "Sci Rep", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Vande Voort, Robert J. Morgan, Simon Kung, Keith G. Rasmussen, Jose Rico, Brian A. Palmer, Kathryn M. Schak, Susannah J. Tye, Matthew J. Ritter, Mark A. Frye and William V. Bobo (Journal of Affective Disorders, 2016[Dec], Vol 206, 300-304). In the original article, there was an error in the classification of one study subject's positive treatment response status at the end of the postcontinuation phase of this study. We originally reported that all 5 subjects who achieved depressive symptom remission during the acute phase of the study (and thus received 4 weekly continuation phase ketamine infusions) were classified as responders at the end of the postcontinuation phase. However, one of these 5 subjects was misclassified as a positive treatment responder at the end of the post-continuation phase. Therefore, only 4 of these 5 patients were positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Although our main conclusions are not changed, we believe that it is our responsibility to report the error and updated results. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-53187-042[/rid]). Background: Little is known about the antidepressive effects of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions beyond the acute phase of treatment in patients with refractory depression. Methods: Twelve subjects with treatment-resistant non-psychotic unipolar or bipolar major depression and suicidal ideation were given repeated (up to 6) thrice-weekly acute-phase intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5mg/kg, administered over 100min). Those who remitted during acute-phase treatment received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of 4 weekly ketamine infusions, followed by 4 weeks of post-continuation phase follow-up (during which no further ketamine infusions were administered). Clinical measures were assessed at baseline, at 24h following each infusion, at the last acute-phase observation, and during continuation and post-continuation follow-up (acute phase remitters only). Results: Of the 12 enrollees, 5 (41.7%) remitted and 7 (58.3%) responded to ketamine treatment during the acute-phase. All five subjects who remitted during the acute-phase experienced further depressive symptom improvement during continuation-phase treatment. Four subjects lost remission status during the post-continuation phase, but all were still classified as positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Adverse effects were generally mild and transient during acute- and continuation-phase treatment; however, one subject developed behavioral outbursts and suicide threats during follow-up while hospitalized, and one subject died by suicide several weeks after the end of follow-up. Limitations: This was an uncontrolled feasibility study with a small sample size. Conclusions: The continuation-phase administration of ketamine at weekly intervals to patients with treatment-resistant depression who remitted during acute-phase ketamine treatment can extend the duration of depressive symptom remission. The antidepressive effect of ketamine persisted for several weeks after the end of continuation-phase treatment. Our results highlight the need for close monitoring of subjects who are at high baseline risk for suicide but do not respond clinically to ketamine.

The effect size was small in episodic participants (d = 0.35) but large in chronic participants (d = 1.25), which remained over the entire 8-week period measured (d = 0.81). Changes in cluster attack frequency were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during psilocybin administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated without any unexpected or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this initial, exploratory study provide valuable information for the development of larger, more definitive studies. Efficacy outcomes were negative, owing in part to the small number of participants. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects underscores the need for further investigation into the mechanism(s) of action of psilocybin in headache disorders.", "doi": "10.1111/head.14420", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36416492/", "secondary_title": "Headache", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

The legal status of ibogaine in New Zealand provides a unique opportunity to evaluate durability of treatment outcomes. OBJECTIVE: To examine longitudinal treatment effects over a 12-month period among individuals receiving legal ibogaine treatment for opioid dependence. METHOD: This observational study measured addiction severity as the primary outcome in 14 participants (50% female) over 12 months post-treatment using the Addiction Severity Index-Lite (ASI-Lite) following a single ibogaine treatment by either of two treatment providers. Secondary effects on depression were assessed via the Beck Depression Inventory-II (BDI-II). The Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale (SOWS) was collected before and immediately after treatment to measure opioid withdrawal symptoms. RESULTS: Nonparametric comparisons via Friedman Test between baseline and 12-month follow-up for participants completing all interviews (n = 8) showed a significant reduction for the ASI-Lite drug use (p = 0.002) composite score. Reductions in BDI-II scores from baseline to 12-month follow-up were also significant (p < 0.001). Significant reductions in SOWS scores for all participants (n = 14) were also observed acutely after treatment (p = 0.015). Patients with partial data (n = 4) also showed reductions in ASI-Lite drug use scores and family/social status problems. One patient enrolled in the study died during treatment.

The evidence for IV ketamine's specific effects on suicidal ideation is less clear, however. This study sought to examine whether differential placebo (saline or midazolam) response to overall depressive symptoms vs suicidal ideation may help explain these divergent findings. METHODS: Data for this participant-level integrative data analysis were drawn from 151 participants across 10 studies, and linear regression was used to examine the relationship between placebo response for suicidal ideation vs other depressive symptoms indexed from standard rating scales-specifically, depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and guilt-over time. RESULTS: For participants receiving saline placebo (n = 46), greater placebo response was observed for suicidal ideation compared with other symptoms indexed from standard depression rating scales, except for anxiety. For those receiving midazolam placebo (n = 105), greater placebo response was observed for suicidal ideation compared with depressed mood or anhedonia, and no significant differences were observed when comparing suicidal ideation with anxiety or guilt. CONCLUSIONS: Taken together, the results provide preliminary evidence of a differential placebo response for suicidal ideation vs other depressive symptoms, while anxiety and suicidal ideation appear to produce similar placebo response profiles.

Aim: To examine the efficacy and safety of ketamine augmentation of ECT in MDD treatment. Methods: Two reviewers searched Chinese (China National Knowledge Infrastructure and Wanfang) and English (PubMed, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane Library) databases from their inception to 23 July 2019. The included studies' bias risk was evaluated using the Cochrane risk of bias assessment tool. The primary outcome of this meta-analysis was improved depressive symptoms at day 1 after a single ECT treatment session. Data were pooled to calculate the standardised mean difference and risk ratio with their 95% CIs using RevMan V.5.3. We used the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development and Evaluation (GRADE) approach to assess the whole quality of evidence. Results: Four RCTs (n = 239) compared ketamine alone or ketamine plus propofol (n = 149) versus propofol alone (n = 90) in patients with MDD who underwent a single ECT session. Three RCTs were considered as unclear risk with respect to random sequence generation using the Cochrane risk of bias. Compared with propofol alone, ketamine alone and the combination of ketamine and propofol had greater efficacy in the treatment of depressive symptoms at days 1, 3 and 7 after a single ECT session. Moreover, compared with propofol alone, ketamine alone and the combination of ketamine and propofol were significantly associated with increased seizure duration and seizure energy index. Compared with propofol, ketamine alone was significantly associated with increased opening-eye time.

In contrast to conventional therapies, these drugs are reported to produce lasting reductions in headache burden after a single or few dose, though controlled studies investigating these unique effects are lacking. In this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over exploratory study, we sought to investigate the effects of a single low oral dose of psilocybin in migraine headache. Methods: Adults with migraine headache, free from significant medical or psychiatric disease were selected for the study. Subjects received oral placebo and psilocybin approximately two weeks apart under an approved enhanced blinding procedure. Headache diaries were maintained by subjects starting two weeks before the first session until two weeks after the second session. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessions and several follow‐up contacts were carried out.

Results: Data from 9 subjects (6 female, 3 male) who received placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) are presented.

Participants who reported last year use of lysergic acid diethylamide or psilocybin in the Global Drug Survey 2019 were offered the opportunity to answer a sub-section on microdosing. RESULTS: Data from 6753 people who reported microdosing at least once in the last 12 months were used for analyses. Our results suggest a partial replication of previously reported benefits and challenges among the present sample often reporting enhanced mood, creativity, focus and sociability. Counter to our prediction, the most common challenge participants associated with microdosing was 'None'. As predicted, most participants reported not testing their substances. Counter to our hypothesis, approach-intention - microdosing to approach a desired goal - predicted less rather than more benefits. We discuss alternate frameworks that may better capture the reasons people microdose. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest the perceived benefits associated with microdosing greatly outweigh the challenges. Microdosing may have utility for a variety of uses while having minimal side effects. Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments are required to substantiate these reports.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881120953994", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33591231/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

With the possible exception of trait absorption, there were no compelling between-condition differences warranting conclusions regarding a selective action of PT (v. escitalopram) on personality; however, post-escitalopram changes in personality were significantly moderated by pre-trial positive expectancy for escitalopram, whereas expectancy did not moderate response to PT.", "doi": "10.1017/s0033291723001514", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37264814/", "secondary_title": "Psychol Med", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Using a web-based data collection procedure, we recruited MDMA/ecstasy users (n = 240) to rate their agreement with eight craving statements immediately before and immediately following 90 seconds of exposure to either ecstasy-related or control stimuli. Participants then completed questionnaires to measure ecstasy refusal self-efficacy, passionate engagement in ecstasy use, substance use history, and demographic information. Fifty percent of participants indicated some level of agreement with at least two (out of eight) statements indicative of craving and 30% agreed at some level with six or more such statements. The questionnaire used to assess craving was internally consistent, unidimensional, and had excellent one-week test-retest reliability.

The intervention is a combined pharmacological and psychological treatment. Dosing sessions The experimental drug is psilocybin, taken orally. There will be two dosing sessions approximately 3 weeks apart. Dose 1 = 25mg psilocybin; Dose 2 = 25 or 30mg psilocybin. Doses will be maintained at 25mg across both sessions unless the participant exhibits limited acute subjective response during the first session (as determined by acute effects questionnaires) without substantial adverse effects, in which case the dose will be increased to 30mg for the second session. A range of extraâ€pharmacological parameters are specified to optimise safety and efficacy. Psychotherapy The psychotherapy is conducted by qualified and experienced mental healthcare therapists who have also undergone an extensive trialâ€specific psychedelic therapist training program with supervised practice. All psychotherapy and dosing sessions will take part at BrainPark, Monash University, within comfortably furnished and aesthetically pleasing rooms.

These features limit ketamine's ability to be a widely used treatment for depression and thus limit is ability to have a meaningful impact on the heavy morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, despite its \"breakthrough\" rate of efficacy and speed of action. While growing numbers of clinicians are using ketamine to treat treatment resistant depression, many in the depression field believe that the aforementioned limiting aspects need to be separated from its remarkable therapeutic effects in order to unlock the breakthrough potential of this agent. To that end, drug development efforts have focused on various features of ketamine as targets for optimization including its modulation of the NMDA receptor, its pharmacokinetics, its chirality and its active metabolites including HNK (2R, 6R)-hyroxynorketamine.

However, whether a composite of clinical markers may improve the predicted probability of response is uncertain. METHODS: The current study investigated the results of our previous randomized placebo-controlled and open-label trials in which 73 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) received a single ketamine infusion of 0.5 mg/kg. Clinical characteristics at baseline, including depression severity, duration of the current episode, obesity, comorbidity of anxiety disorder, and current suicide risk, were assessed as potential predictors in a classification and regression tree model for treatment response to ketamine infusion. RESULTS: The predicted probability of a composite of age at disease onset, depression severity, duration of current episode, and obesity/overweight was significantly greater (area under curve = .736, p = .001) than that of any one marker (all p > .05). The most powerful predictors of treatment response to ketamine infusion were younger age at disease onset and obesity/overweight.

This study was aimed at assessing the contribution of CYP2D6 to MDMA disposition in vivo using paroxetine as a metabolic probe inhibitor. Paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, was repeatedly administered before MDMA administration. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomised, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial conducted in seven healthy male volunteers who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Treatment conditions (paroxetine/MDMA and placebo/MDMA) were randomly assigned. Each volunteer participated in two 3-day sessions. On days 1, 2 and 3 subjects received a single oral dose of paroxetine or placebo 20 mg. On the third day, a single oral dose of MDMA 100 mg was administered in both paroxetine and placebo conditions. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of MDMA and its metabolites were measured, as well as plasma concentrations of paroxetine, (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine, and (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine (HM-paroxetine). RESULTS: Paroxetine given before MDMA resulted in significant increases of MDMA area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 27 hours (AUC(27)) [23%], AUC from zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) [27%] and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) [17%], without significant differences in MDMA time to reach C(max) (t(max)). MDMA elimination-related pharmacokinetic parameters showed a significant reduction of MDMA elimination rate constant (K(e)) [-14%] and plasmatic clearance (CL(P)) [-29%].

Although acute ketamine can induce effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, chronic use may be a closer model of idiopathic psychosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that ketamine users had lower brain volumes, as measured using MRI, and greater sub-threshold psychotic symptoms relative to a poly-drug user control group. METHODS: Ketamine users (n = 17) and poly-drug using controls (n = 19) were included in the study. All underwent volumetric MRI imaging and measurement of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Freesurfer was used to analyse differences in regional brain volume, cortical surface area and thickness between ketamine users and controls.

This study compared the efficacy and safety of switching patients with treatment-resistant depression from an ineffective antidepressant to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated antidepressant or to a newly initiated antidepressant (active comparator) plus placebo nasal spray. Methods: This was a phase 3, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study conducted at 39 outpatient referral centers. The study enrolled adults with moderate to severe nonpsychotic depression and a history of nonresponse to at least two antidepressants in the current episode, with one antidepressant assessed prospectively. Confirmed nonresponders were randomly assigned to treatment with esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) and an antidepressant or antidepressant and placebo nasal spray.

Aims To assess specific/independent neurotoxic effects of heavy ecstasy use and contributions of amphetamine, cocaine and cannabis as part of The Netherlands XTC Toxicity (NeXT) study. Method Effects of ecstasy and other substances were assessed with 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy, diffusion tensor imaging, perfusion weighted imaging and [123I]2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl)-tropane ([ 123I]β-CIT) single photon emission computed tomography (serotonin transporters) in a sample (n=71) with broad variation in drug use, using multiple regression analyses. Results Ecstasy showed specific effects in the thalamus with decreased [123I]β-ClT binding, suggesting serotonergic axonal damage; decreased fractional anisotropy, suggesting axonal loss; and increased cerebral blood volume probably caused by serotonin depletion.

Such a profound effect on emotion and mood processes might underlie the putative antidepressant properties of psilocybin, as it has repeatedly been shown that a critical mechanism for antidepressant efficacy may be an effect which counteracts negative mood states and limbic hyperactivity in response to negative stimuli in patients with major depression. A recent clinical study [2] in patients with depression and anxiety related to advanced‐stage cancer supports this notion: a single dose of psilocybin significantly decreased anxiety and increased positive mood for up to 6 months. However, the neurobiological mechanisms by which psilocybin influences emotion processing remain poorly understood. In particular, it is still unclear whether psilocybin modulates the activity of the amygdala, a region that plays a crucial role in the neural effects of antidepressants, during emotion processing, and whether any psilocybin‐induced effect on amygdala activity during emotion processing is related to changes in mood state. Methods: In this study, the acute effects of low‐dose psilocybin (0.16 mg/kg) on amygdala activation were measured using blood oxygenation level‐dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) during an emotion processing task and in combination with assessment of mood changes. 25 healthy subjects (16 males, mean age 24.2±3.42 years) were included in the study. The study followed a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over design. Subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin at two separate imaging sessions 2 weeks apart. During scanning, subjects performed an established amygdala reactivity task, using picture stimuli from the International Affective Picture System (IAPS). Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) and the state portion of the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Results: Both whole‐brain voxel‐wise and region of interest (ROI)‐based analyses showed that right‐amygdala activation in response to negative stimuli was significantly lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration (psilocybin mean±SD: 0.36±0.28; placebo: 0.58±0.36; p<0.001). Further, psilocybin significantly increased positive mood (p = 0.001), but not anxiety (p = 0.37), and this effect was correlated to psilocybininduced decrease of amygdala reactivity (r = ‐0.46, p<0.05). Conclusions: Results show that acute administration of lowdose psilocybin decrease amygdala reactivity to negative pictures. Notably, this effect was correlated with psilocybin‐induced increase in positive mood. These findings confirm and extend previous evidence that 5‐HT1A/2A receptor stimulation may induce positive mood states and decrease neural responses to negative stimuli. In addition, this study demonstrates that the amygdala, a key component within limbic structures implicated in emotion processing, may be an important neural target underlying the hypothesized antidepressant properties of psilocybin.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

In all four groups the median values of the modal alpha frequencies of the spectra (Hz bands of peak power) were lower for low than for high hallucinators (p<0.065). Similarly, in all four groups there was systematically more slow alpha and less fast alpha in low than in high hallucinations. These findings of pre-treatment correlates of predisposition to visual hallucinations suggest that a common CNS mechanism may operate in different conditions (drugs, day-dreams, hypnagogic reverie) which produce visual hallucinations.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Electroencephalography and Clinical Neurophysiology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal. Further studies targeting neurocognitive outcomes are encouraged.

All groups also received the sufentanil (2.2 μg kg(-1)). The primary outcome was the incidence of PDS at 7 and 42 days postpartum. The secondary outcomes were: the remission from depression and total EPDS scores at 7 days and 42 days postpartum; mean change from baseline in the EPDS score; postoperative analgesia. RESULTS: i). 0.25 mg kg(-1) of esketamine intravenous infusion combined with 1 mg kg(-1) (n = 99) or 2 mg kg(-1) (n = 99) esketamine PCIA reduces PDS incidence at 7 days postpartum (p < 0.05), with high-dose esketamine PCIA also reduces PDS incidence 42 days postpartum (p < 0.05), compared to placebo (n = 97). ii). Low- and high-dose esketamine PCIA lowers NRS scores at rest within 48 h postoperatively (p < 0.01), with high-dose esketamine also reducing the NRS score during movement at 48 h postoperatively (p = 0.018). iii). Neither high- nor low-dose esketamine PCIA increased postoperative adverse reactions (p > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine (0.25 mg kg(-1)) intravenous infusion combined with 1 mg kg(-1) or 2 mg kg(-1) esketamine PCIA seems safe and with few adverse effects in the management of PDS and pain in women undergoing cesarean section. LIMITATIONS: The tolerability and safety of esketamine requires further investigation based on more specific scales; the transient side effects of esketamine could have biased the staff and patients.

In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change. METHODS: This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers.

METHODS: This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.04.010", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24882567/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry", "annotation": "Substance(s)"}

However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026). EEG patterns did not differ during the recovery period after emergence between groups.

However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026).

METHODS: A double-blind, randomized and comparative parallel-group study design was employed in 40 volunteers with ASA physical status 1 who were scheduled for elective superficial surgery under ketamine anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine (2.5 micrograms/kg, n = 20) or midazolam (0.07 mg/kg, n = 20) was administered intramuscularly 45 min before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg ketamine intravenously, and muscle relaxation was achieved with vecuronium. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen (2:1) and additional 1 mg/kg intravenous ketamine boluses according to clinical and cardiovascular criteria.

Age-related impairments in working memory have been attributed to a slow down in information processing speed. The present study compared 29 current ecstasy users, 10 previous users and 46 non-users on two tests measuring information processing speed and a computation span task measuring working memory. Results showed that ecstasy users performed worse than non-ecstasy users in the letter comparison task although the overall difference was not significant (p = 0.089). Results from the pattern recognition task showed that current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < 0.01). When results were combined for both the letter and pattern tasks, once again current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than non-ecstasy users (p < 0.01). Working memory deficits obtained were statistically significant with both ecstasy using groups performing significantly worse than non-users on the computation span measure (p < 0.01). Moreover, ANCOVA with measures of processing speed as covariates failed to eliminate the group difference in computation span (p < 0.01).

Fifty-two patients in the treatment group were administered 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on induction of anesthesia, and a continuous infusion at 10 microg kg(-1) min(-1) was begun on induction and terminated at wound closure. Fifty patients in the placebo group received saline of equivalent volume. Patients were observed for 48 h postoperatively and followed up at 6 weeks. The primary outcome was 48-h morphine consumption. RESULTS: Total morphine consumption (morphine equivalents) was significantly reduced in the treatment group 48 h after the procedure. It was also reduced at 24 h and at 6 weeks. The average reported pain intensity was significantly reduced in the postanesthesia care unit and at 6 weeks. The groups had no differences in known ketamine- or opiate-related side effects.

Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg.

Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects.

Searching for acute-phase, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trials, we found 22 second-generation antipsychotic (n = 8363) and 3 intranasal esketamine (n = 641) studies. Mean change in the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score served as outcome. We determined a higher mean difference (vs placebo) for the pooled esketamine nasal spray trials (mean difference = 4.09, 95% confidence interval: 2.01 to 6.17) than for the pooled second-generation antipsychotic augmentation trials (mean difference  = 2.05, 95% confidence interval: 1.51 to 2.59).

Data were collected with a combination of computer-assisted personal interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Results: The overall prevalence of HUDs among adolescents was low (<1%). However, more than one in three (38.5%) MDMA users and nearly one in four (24.1%) users of other hallucinogens reported HUD symptoms. MDMA users were more likely than users of other hallucinogens to meet criteria for hallucinogen dependence: 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.24-14.81) vs. 3.5% (95% CI: 2.22-5.43). Compared with hallucinogen use only, subthreshold dependence was associated with being female (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.08-2.89]), ages 12-13 years (AOR = 3.4 [1.64-7.09]), use of hallucinogens ≥52 days (AOR = 2.4 [1.66-6.92]), and alcohol use disorder (AOR = 1.8 [1.21-2.77]). Compared with subthreshold dependence, abuse was associated with mental health service use (AOR = 1.7 [1.00-3.00]) and opioid use disorder (AOR = 4.9 [1.99-12.12]); dependence was associated with MDMA use (AOR = 2.2 [1.05-4.77]), mental health service use (AOR = 2.9 [1.34-6.06]), and opioid use disorder (AOR = 2.6 [1.01-6.90]).

{"record_id": 6066, "keywords": "['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Ketamine', 'Midazolam']", "text": "Ketamine for Depression Relapse Prevention Following ECT.^\nDESIGN: This pilot trial has two phases. Phase 1 is a prospective open study that involves recruiting a cohort of patients with major depressive disorder (DSM‐IV criteria) referred for ECT. Patients subsequently identified as being responders will be invited to participate in Phase 2, which is a two‐group parallel‐design randomised controlled pilot trial. Consented ECT‐responders will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a four‐week course of either once‐weekly ketamine or midazolam infusions, continuing regular care. Participants will be followed‐up over six‐months following ECT to identify if and when relapse occurs. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: In Phase 2, ECT responders will be randomised after baseline data collection. Patients and raters will be blind to treatment allocation. The anaesthetist administering ketamine/midazolam infusions will not be blinded but will not be involved in assessments or data analysis. Computerised random allocation, using randomly permuted blocks, will be done independently. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria: Patients ≥18 years with unipolar major depressive disorder (DSM‐IV), a 24‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD‐24) score of ≥21, and referred for ECT will be invited to participate in the open Phase 1. Patients will have a physical examination, routine haematology and biochemistry investigations, and an ECG to screen for any medical conditions that might affect ability to be treated with ECT or ketamine. For the randomised Phase 2, patients must have (i) received a substantial course of ECT in Phase 1 (i.e. at least five sessions), (ii) achieved at least response criteria (i.e. ≥60% decrease from baseline HRSD‐24 score and score ≤16 on two consecutive weekly ratings), (iii) have a nominated adult who can stay with them for 24‐hours on out‐patient treatment days, (iv) have a Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of ≥24, and (v) be able to provide informed consent. Patients will continue on regular psychotropic and other medications as prescribed by their consultant psychiatrist. This reflects the conditions under which adjunctive ketamine would be used in routine clinical practice, thereby enhancing the generalisability and external validity of a future definitive trial. Exclusion criteria are: any condition rendering patients medically unfit for general anaesthesia, ECT or ketamine; active suicidal intention; dementia; lifetime history of bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, or other Axis 1 diagnosis; ECT in the previous six‐months; alcohol/substance abuse in previous six‐months; pregnancy; inability/refusal to consent. Patients will be given verbal and full written information and be asked to provide written informed consent. INTERVENTIONS: Please see description OUTCOMES Process outcomes The focus of a pilot trial's outcomes is on trial process with assessment of the primary clinical outcome being secondary because the pilot itself is not designed to measure efficacy. Process outcomes that will inform a future definitive ketamine relapse prevention trial include information on the following: ‐ recruitment methods and rate ‐ willingness of participants to be randomised ‐ willingness of participants to complete assessments ‐ randomisation ‐ success of blinding ‐ ability to administer a course of ketamine infusions ‐ medical safety and acceptability of ketamine infusions in an ECT responder population ‐ rates of adverse dissociative and psychiatric events ‐ adherence to allocated treatment ‐ adherence to follow‐up ‐ reasons for drop‐out from treatment ‐ reasons for drop‐out from follow‐up ‐ a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the ketamine and midazolam groups in six‐month relapse rates to help with power calculations for a future definitive trial Clinical outcomes: The following will be used to obtain baseline, intra‐treatment, end‐of‐treatment and follow‐up data. Most are standard measures used by ourselves and others in depression, ECT or keta ine studies. Raters will be trained on all measures before recruitment begins. (i) Diagnosis and treatment history: Diagnosis of major depressive disorder will be confirmed using the mood episodes module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM‐IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). The Columbia Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) will be used to obtain index episode treatment details and provide measures of treatment‐resistance. Handedness will be recorded with the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) will measure premorbid ability. Additional baseline data from patient interview and case‐note review will include age, sex, weight, height, occupation, educational attainment, duration of index depressive episode, number of previous depressive episodes, previous ECT, history of medical illness and surgical treatments, personal and family history of alcohol/substance dependency, presence of psychotic symptoms (detected by SCID), and current medications and other therapies. Changes in medications during Phases 1 and 2 will be documented at follow‐up interviews. (ii) Depression outcomes: The primary clinical outcome measure is the relapse rate at six months as measured using the objectively‐rated 24‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD‐24). To enter Phase 1 patients must score ≥21. Response to ECT is defined as achieving ≥60% decrease from baseline HRSD‐24 and score ≤16 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Remission criteria are ≥60% decrease in HRSD from baseline and score ≤10 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Criteria for relapse are ≥10 point increase in HRSD‐24 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD ≥16; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow‐ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate self‐harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Timing of these events will be recorded. Patients must achieve at least response to participate in the Phase 2 pilot trial. Baseline and weekly intra‐treatment course HRSD‐24 scores will be obtained during the treatment periods of Phases 1 and 2. During the infusion sessions in Phase 2 HRSD‐24 scores will be obtained 60 minutes before the infusion begins and at +120 and +240 minutes afterwards. Baseline scores on sleep and appetite items will be maintained for repeated measures within one day. The +240 HRSD‐24 scores will serve as the weekly post‐ECT scores up to follow‐up‐week 4. Depression measures will be repeated at weeks 6, 8, 12, 20 and 26 during the six‐month follow‐up. Subjective mood ratings will be measured at the above timepoints using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, self‐report version (QIDS‐SR16). 1. Global cognition will be assessed with the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE‐R; three parallel versions) which also generates Mini‐Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency scores. The ACE‐R provides a total score (maximum=100) plus subscale scores for different aspects of cognition and has been used to study cognition in depression and by ourselves during ECT. 2. Forward and Backward Digit Spans ‐ immediate short‐term memory, attention and working memory 3. Trail Making Test (Part A) ‐ motor and psychomotor speed 4. Frontal‐executive function will be rated by Trail Making Test (Part B) plus letter and category verbal fluencies. 5. Anterograde verbal memory will be tested using the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test variant (immediate and delayed recall) of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. (iii) Cognitive outcomes: Cognitive testing can be challenging for severely depressed patients. It is vital that patients be encouraged to remain in the trial throughout the whole study period and a great deal of tact is required of raters. Priority will be given to obtaining scores on the HRSD‐24. In a recent meta‐analysis we identified that ECT has the most pronounced subacute (i.e. 0‐3 days post course) adverse effects upon verbal memor (delayed word list recall) and frontal executive function. Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine can cause problems with orientation, concentration, working and episodic memory but these resolve within two hours of beginning an infusion. There are no published data on effects of ketamine on cognition in ECT responders. We will use the following battery in Phase 1 (pre and post ECT course; the latter will serve as baseline for Phase 2) and Phase 2 (one day after the first and fourth infusions and at six‐months). Parallel versions will be used to reduce practice effects. 6. To measure retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information we will use the Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview (K‐AMI), The K‐AMI will be administered pre and post ECT, after the fourth ketamine infusion, and at six months. (iv) Ketamine psychotomimetic effects and adverse events: Acute psychotomimetic effects of ketamine are usually short‐lived and restricted to the infusion period, resolving within one hour. They include dissociative and psychiatric symptoms. In line with previous ketamine trials we will measure dissociative effects with the Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), psychotomimetic effects with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; four‐item positive symptom subscale), and mood elevation with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; mood item). These effects will be measured before, during (+35‐40 mins) and after (+240 mins) the ketamine infusions. The Patient‐Rated Inventory of Side Effects will be used to document other general adverse events by patients at the same time points. All adverse medical, psychotomimetic and general events will be reported to the Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committees. STATISTICAL METHODS A formal sample size calculation is not appropriate for this pilot trial. Pilot trial data will be analysed on an intention‐to‐treat basis for all patients who completed at least one infusion. Data analyses will be performed blinded to allocation.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02414932", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration.

The authors identified 14 articles reporting on well-designed clinical trials investigating the efficacy of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and ayahuasca for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders as well as in end-of-life care. Results: The most significant database exists for MDMA and psilocybin, which have been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as “breakthrough therapies” for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment-resistant depression, respectively. The research on LSD and ayahuasca is observational, but available evidence suggests that these agents may have therapeutic effects in specific psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: Randomized clinical trials support the efficacy of MDMA in the treatment of PTSD and psilocybin in the treatment of depression and cancer-related anxiety. The research to support the use of LSD and ayahuasca in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is preliminary, although promising. Overall, the database is insufficient for FDA approval of any psychedelic compound for routine clinical use in psychiatric disorders at this time, but continued research on the efficacy of psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is warranted.", "doi": "10.1176/APPI.FOCUS.19104", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34483775/", "secondary_title": "Focus (United States)", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

We tested whether a brief course of exposurebased cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) could extend ketamine's effects in a two week pilot open trial and if this effect was maintained (without additional treatment) two weeks later. Our rationale was: 1) ketamine is reported to enhance plasticity and extinction learning in rodents, and 2) enhanced extinction learning may facilitate CBT gains, as reported in trials that combined CBT with agents thought to facilitate extinction learning (e.g. D‐cycloserine). Mimicking those trials, CBT was abbreviated (i.e. 10 one‐hour exposure sessions) but delivered during the putative time interval when ketamine facilitates extinction learning (within 14 days). Methods: With IRB approval, ten unmedicated OCD outpatients (aged 18‐55) with near‐constant intrusive obsessions (48 hours/day) were recruited (3/2014‐3/ 2015). They provided written informed consent. Participants met DSM‐IV and DSM‐5 criteria for OCD with at least moderate symptoms (Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale [Y‐BOCS] score ≥16). Exclusion criteria included severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS] 425), current CBT, and comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that made participation unsafe. In an open‐label design, participants received a single 40‐minute IV infusion of ketamine (dose=0.5 mg/kg), followed by 10 one‐hour exposure sessions delivered over two weeks. The CBT treatment was planned in a 90‐minute session the day before the ketamine infusion. At baseline, during the infusion, at 20, 90, 110, 230 minutes post‐infusion, patients rated their obsessional severity using the OCD‐VAS. We focused on obsessions because the patients were supine and connected to stationary monitoring equipment during the infusion. At baseline and weekly for four weeks post‐ketamine, an independent evaluator, blind to study design, evaluated patients using the Y‐BOCS, which appraises obsessive and compulsive symptoms over the prior week. Treatment response was defined a priori as ≥35% Y‐BOCS reduction at week 2. Y‐BOCS outcomes were analyzed using mixed‐effects regression to model symptoms as a function of time. Results: Of the 10 patients who started ketamine, nine completed the infusion. Eight reported a rapid reduction in obsessive severity as measured by the OCD‐VAS, which persisted up to 230 minutes post‐infusion in seven patients. Eight completed the 10 hours of exposure and the two week follow‐up and were included in the Y‐BOCS analyses. From baseline to four weeks post‐infusion, OCD severity, as measured by the YBOCS, was significantly decreased over time (F=14.36, df=4,28, p<.0001; Figure 1). Compared to baseline, the mean estimated Y‐BOCS score was significantly lower at week 2 (difference=‐10.75 points, SE=1.44, p<.0001) and at week 4 (difference=‐6.88, SE=2.61,p=0.01); there was a trend‐level increase between week 2 and 4 (difference=3.63, SE=1.97, p=0.07). At the end of CBT (week 2), 63% of patients demonstrated treatment response (≥35% Y‐BOCS reduction). Importantly, individuals varied in their response, with one subject having no benefit, the majority benefitting for up to two weeks, and one no longer meeting criteria for OCD (i.e., achieving minimal symptoms post‐infusion that persisted throughout the CBT and for up to 6 months in naturalistic follow‐up). Conclusions: These results corroborate prior findings that IV ketamine can rapidly reduce obsessions in unmedicated OCD patients. The data suggest that a brief course of CBT may help some individuals maintain the improvement they experienced from ketamine; however, this needs to be formally tested in a randomized controlled trial to determine whether the improvement seen after two weeks of CBT is due to the addition of CBT, or whether t e effects of ketamine persist longer in some than previously described.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2015.325", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26632286/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

Since the cerebrovasculature is regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these effects may be transient.

We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these effects may be transient.

The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as \"candyflipping.\" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) and LSD (100 µg) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD + MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (C(max) and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD + MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD + MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100 µg). The combined use of MDMA and LSD is unlikely to provide relevant benefits over LSD alone in psychedelic-assisted therapy.

RESULTS: After the first ketamine infusion, only 10 (13.0%) and 6 (7.8%) patients responded and remitted, respectively; after six ketamine infusions, 52 (67.5%) patients responded and 37 (48.1%) remitted. There was a significant mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at four hours after the first ketamine infusion (7.0±7.5, p<0.001), and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the infusion period. The response to ketamine treatment was positively associated with no history of psychiatric hospitalization (odds ratio=3.56, p=0.009).

RESULTS: After the first ketamine infusion, only 10 (13.0%) and 6 (7.8%) patients responded and remitted, respectively; after six ketamine infusions, 52 (67.5%) patients responded and 37 (48.1%) remitted. There was a significant mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score at four hours after the first ketamine infusion (7.0±7.5, p<0.001), and this decrease was maintained for the duration of the infusion period.

Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non‐opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well‐being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an \"opioid‐free\" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double‐blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub‐dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 ‐ 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non‐traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on‐duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e‐mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0.

From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI), Symptom Checklist‐90 item (SCL‐90), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18‐35 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D‐ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019.

From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI), Symptom Checklist‐90 item (SCL‐90), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18‐35 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D‐ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019. Four strata were populated, (males 18‐35) n = 24; (males 35+) n = 24; (females 18‐35) n = 23; (females 35+) n = 18. 38% of the participants had prior psilocybin experience. A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed, with up to 6 participants per session (2 sessions with 1 participant, 3 with 2 participants, 5 with 3 participants, 11 with 4, 2 with 5, and, 2 ith 6). In the simultaneous administration sessions, each participant was supported by an assisting therapist, overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist. During this study, 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies. Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences. The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists.

CONCLUSIONS: These results describe the spectrum of clinical effects produced by increasing NMDA receptor blockade in HD patients. The clinical effects appearing with higher levels of NMDA receptor blockade can identify the range of doses used in clinical trials of NMDA receptor antagonists.", "doi": "10.1212/wnl.49.1.153", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9222184/", "secondary_title": "Neurology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

We conclude that it is crucial to include sex and age in studies of drug effects in general and of ketamine-action in specific to tailor more efficient psychiatric treatments.

Considering the relationship between rumination and depression and the need to identify potential predictors of response to ketamine, we analyzed the effect of a single injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg on rumination in treatment-resistant depressive (TRD) patients and explored whether baseline ruminative style and early improvements of rumination would predict a greater antidepressant effect of ketamine. METHODS: Ten TRD outpatients who participated in a 4-week open study on the antidepressant effect of ketamine also completed the Ruminative Response Scale the day before, the day after, and a week after ketamine administration. RESULTS: We found that in our patients, a single rapid 1-minute intravenous injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg was efficacious in reducing rumination, but neither severity of rumination at baseline nor early improvements of rumination after ketamine injection predicted antidepressant response.

Methods: A 4-day electrocardiogram was recorded for 16 treatment-resistant patients with MDD and 16 age- and sex-matched controls before, and for the patient group only, after a single treatment with the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine or placebo (clinical trial registration available on https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ with EUDRACT number 2016-001715-21).

Baseline HR/RMSSD were tested as predictors for treatment response, and physiological measures were assessed as state markers. Results: Patients showed higher HR and lower RMSSD alongside marked reductions in HR amplitude and RMSSD variation throughout the day. Excellent classification accuracy was achieved using HR during the night, particularly between 2 and 3 a.m. (90.6%).
