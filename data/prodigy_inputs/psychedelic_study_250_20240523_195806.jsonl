Those who remitted during acute-phase treatment received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of 4 weekly ketamine infusions, followed by 4 weeks of post-continuation phase follow-up (during which no further ketamine infusions were administered). Clinical measures were assessed at baseline, at 24h following each infusion, at the last acute-phase observation, and during continuation and post-continuation follow-up (acute phase remitters only). RESULTS: Of the 12 enrollees, 5 (41.7%) remitted and 7 (58.3%) responded to ketamine treatment during the acute-phase. All five subjects who remitted during the acute-phase experienced further depressive symptom improvement during continuation-phase treatment. Four subjects lost remission status during the post-continuation phase, but all were still classified as positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase.

Those who remitted during acute-phase treatment received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of 4 weekly ketamine infusions, followed by 4 weeks of post-continuation phase follow-up (during which no further ketamine infusions were administered). Clinical measures were assessed at baseline, at 24h following each infusion, at the last acute-phase observation, and during continuation and post-continuation follow-up (acute phase remitters only). RESULTS: Of the 12 enrollees, 5 (41.7%) remitted and 7 (58.3%) responded to ketamine treatment during the acute-phase. All five subjects who remitted during the acute-phase experienced further depressive symptom improvement during continuation-phase treatment. Four subjects lost remission status during the post-continuation phase, but all were still classified as positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Adverse effects were generally mild and transient during acute- and continuation-phase treatment; however, one subject developed behavioral outbursts and suicide threats during follow-up while hospitalized, and one subject died by suicide several weeks after the end of follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This was an uncontrolled feasibility study with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The continuation-phase administration of ketamine at weekly intervals to patients with treatment-resistant depression who remitted during acute-phase ketamine treatment can extend the duration of depressive symptom remission. The antidepressive effect of ketamine persisted for several weeks after the end of continuation-phase treatment. Our results highlight the need for close monitoring of subjects who are at high baseline risk for suicide but do not respond clinically to ketamine. CLINICALTRIALS.

The main aim of the present study was investigation of the effects of psilocybin-containing truffles, when taken in a supportive group setting, on ratings of state and trait anxiety across self-reported healthy volunteers. Attendees of psilocybin ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: before the ceremony (baseline), the morning after, and 1 week after the ceremony. The test battery included questionnaires assessing state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), mindfulness capacities (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory). Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire and the Ego Dissolution Inventory. The total amount of psilocybin-containing truffles consumed by each participant was recorded, and a sample of the truffles was analyzed to determine psilocin concentrations.

It has become popular with participants in \"raves\", because it enhances energy, endurance and sexual arousal, together with the widespread belief that MDMA is a safe drug [Byard, R.W., Gilbert, J., James, R., Lokan, R.J., 1998. Amphetamine derivative fatalities in South Australia. Is \"ecstasy\" the culprit? Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 19, 261-265]. However, it is suggested that this drug causes a neurotoxicity to the serotonergic system that could lead to permanent physical and cognitive problems. In order to investigate this issue, and during an ERP recording with 32 channels, we used a visual oddball design, in which subjects (14 MDMA abusers and 14 paired normal controls) saw frequent stimuli (neutral faces) while they had to detect as quickly as possible rare stimuli with happy or fearful expression.

Recent studies showing improvement in suicidal ideation has further increased the interest in its clinical use because when it works, it does so within hours, possibly reducing the risk of suicidal behavior. However, many issues need to be addressed before widespread clinical use can be recommended and definitive controlled trials can be designed. This includes the need for: a) a better developed conceptual framework for the mechanisms underlying Ketamine's antidepressant and nocioceptive properties; b) a clinical algorithm guiding appropriate selection of patients (e.g., first episode vs. treatment resistant depressed patients; presence of suicidal ideation; or patients with co‐occurring chronic pain); c) the identification of dosing strategies or adjunct agents that can extend the therapeutic effect; d) optimization of Ketamine administration protocols (i.e., intramuscular vs. intravenous route of administration and bolus vs. infusion, maximally effective dose, and consequences of concurrent benzodiazepines administration); e) larger placebo‐controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Ketamine in the treatment of suicidal ideation; f) knowledge regarding the psychiatric medications that patients can be taking prior to receiving the treatment; and g) identification of predictive biomarkers and/or illness subtypes more likely to benefit from Ketamine treatment. Methods: Clinical cases of Ketamine administration for depression, suicidal ideation, and pain at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio are being reviewed for this presentation. Clinical chart data and available rating scales will be summarized. When used for treatment of depression, Ketamine is largely administered as in the previously published depression trials (0.5 mg/kg) in 40‐ minute IV infusion. For the treatment of chronic pain and in few cases of depression, much higher doses of Ketamine (up to 2 mg/ kg) are administered as IV bolus along with concurrent benzodiazepines (most often midazolam). Ketamine administration is largely conducted in outpatient settings under direct physician supervision by an anesthesiologist with constant monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation). Full psychiatric evaluations were conducted before the treatment and psychiatric follow was done within 1‐3 days after Ketamine administration. For most depressed patients, mood ratings were collected using the HAMD‐17, HAMD‐7, QIDS‐SR16 and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). Assessment of pain severity was based on ratings severity from 0=No pain to 10=Extreme pain. Results: In agreement with published literature a single Ketamine infusion rapidly alleviated depressive symptomatology (response) in more than half of our patients. The treatment is well tolerated without major side effects. In some patients with comorbid pain, pain also decreased. Most patients first noticed improvement in mood the day after infusion. Although in a patient with severe MDD and residual suicidal ideation after a suicide attempt of high lethality, a sustained clinical response (including resolution of suicidality) was noted as soon as 120 minutes after the infusion began. In one case of severe post‐partum depression, a single bolus infusion of Ketamine (with concurrent use of midazolam) led to a sustained complete remission of symptoms (leading to patient discontinuing her SSRI) that was maintained for 2 months (date of last follow up). Conclusions: A growing body of clinical and research data suggest Ketamine may have clinical utility in some cases of depression and chronic pain.

Full psychiatric evaluations were conducted before the treatment and psychiatric follow was done within 1‐3 days after Ketamine administration. For most depressed patients, mood ratings were collected using the HAMD‐17, HAMD‐7, QIDS‐SR16 and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). Assessment of pain severity was based on ratings severity from 0=No pain to 10=Extreme pain. Results: In agreement with published literature a single Ketamine infusion rapidly alleviated depressive symptomatology (response) in more than half of our patients. The treatment is well tolerated without major side effects. In some patients with comorbid pain, pain also decreased. Most patients first noticed improvement in mood the day after infusion. Although in a patient with severe MDD and residual suicidal ideation after a suicide attempt of high lethality, a sustained clinical response (including resolution of suicidality) was noted as soon as 120 minutes after the infusion began. In one case of severe post‐partum depression, a single bolus infusion of Ketamine (with concurrent use of midazolam) led to a sustained complete remission of symptoms (leading to patient discontinuing her SSRI) that was maintained for 2 months (date of last follow up). Conclusions: A growing body of clinical and research data suggest Ketamine may have clinical utility in some cases of depression and chronic pain. Clinical trials are required to identify the conditions that would maximize Ketamine acute effectiveness, possibly sustain its benefit and ensure the safety of long‐term, regular use.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2012.221", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500146/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Delirium is an acute change in cognition that manifests as poor attention and illogical thinking and is associated with longer intensive care unit (ICU) and hospital stay, long-lasting cognitive deterioration and increased mortality. Ketamine has been used as an anaesthetic drug for over 50 years and has an established safety record.

Early reports suggest that it is useful in treating trauma-related disorders. Recently, the first completed pilot study of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD yielded encouraging results. Designed to test the safety and efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in patients with treatment-resistant PTSD; our randomized, double-blind, active-placebo controlled trial enrolled 12 patients for treatment with either low-dose (25 mg, plus 12.5 mg supplemental dose) or full-dose MDMA (125 mg, plus 62.5 mg supplemental dose). MDMA was administered during three experimental sessions, interspersed with weekly non-drug-based psychotherapy sessions. Outcome measures used were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) and the Posttraumatic Diagnostic Scale (PDS). Patients were assessed at baseline, three weeks after the second and third MDMA session (end of treatment), and at the 2-month and 1-year follow-ups. We found that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered in a clinical setting. No drug-related serious adverse events occurred.

As serotonin has been implicated in human aggression, it is possible that ecstasy users are at risk of increased aggression even after prolonged abstention from the drug. The objective of this study was to indirectly assess aggression in current and abstinent ecstasy users using an information-processing paradigm that measures cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content. The task employed has previously shown increased aggressive bias 3-4 days after ecstasy use. An interpretative bias task was administered to 105 male participants: 26 ex-ecstasy users, 25 current ecstasy users, 29 polydrug using controls, and 25 drug-naive controls. Accuracy and response times to process and recognize ambiguous sentences were tested. There were no group differences in aggressive interpretative bias. All 4 groups processed neutral sentences faster than aggressive sentences and were subsequently faster and more confident in recognizing neutral compared with aggressive sentences. Further, self-ratings of aggression also showed no group differences, even though self-rated impulsivity was significantly higher in current ecstasy users than in drug-naive controls. The findings that all groups were biased toward neutral and away from aggressive interpretations of ambiguous sentences add to the existing body of knowledge in suggesting that increased aggression found in ecstasy users a few days after taking the drug is a transient phenomenon and not a long-term, persisting effect. © 2007 American Psychological Association.", "doi": "10.1037/1064-1297.15.4.351", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17696682/", "secondary_title": "Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Does Psilocybin Change Synaptic Vesicular Density in the Brains of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment?.^\nBackground: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is viewed as a precursor to AD, and is associated with synaptic loss, for which there are no effective treatments. There is renewed interest in using psychedelics, including psilocybin, to treat mental illness. Psilocybin appears to exert its psychedelic and clinical effects through 5HT2A serotonin receptor (5HT2A‐R) agonism. Promisingly, the results of preclinical animal studies suggests that psilocybin may promote synaptogenesis in brain regions responsible for learning and memory, possibly through 5HT2A‐R agonism. As such, psilocybin is worth exploring as a novel therapeutic for aMCI to counter neurogenerative disease progression. The proposed positron emission tomography (PET) study will determine whether psilocybin increases synaptic vesicular density (SVD), as measured by the radioligand [18F]SynVesT‐1, and whether changes in SVD are associated with improvements in cognition. Methods: Thirty aMCI and 30 healthy control participants will be randomized under double‐blind conditions to either: 1) two psilocybin 25mg macrodoses, or 2) two placebo doses separated by 1 week. Supportive psychotherapy will be provided on the days of dose administration. PET scans will occur pre and one week post treatment. Neuropsychological assessments will occur pre and 1, 4, and 12 weeks post treatment.

RESULTS: On the PEQ, positive attitudes about life and/or self, positive mood changes, altruistic/positive social effects, positive behavioral changes, and well-being/life satisfaction significantly increased at 1 and 12 months and were subjectively attributed by the subjects to the LSD experience. Five-Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) total scores, reflecting acutely induced alterations in consciousness, and Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) total scores correlated with changes in well-being/life satisfaction 12 months after LSD administration. No changes in negative attitudes, negative mood, antisocial/negative social effects, or negative behavior were attributed to the LSD experience. After 12 months, 10 of 14 participants rated their LSD experience as among the top 10 most meaningful experiences in their lives. Five participants rated the LSD experience among the five most spiritually meaningful experiences in their lives. On the MS and DTS, ratings of mystical experiences significantly increased 1 and 12 months after LSD administration compared with the pre-LSD screening. No relevant changes in personality measures were found. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy research subjects, the administration of a single dose of LSD (200 μg) in a safe setting was subjectively considered a personally meaningful experience that had long-lasting subjective positive effects.

Among ketamine responders, the relapse rate at the end of the CBT course (8 weeks following the last ketamine exposure) was 25% (2/8). On longer-term follow-up, 5 of 8 subjects eventually relapsed, the median time to relapse being 12 weeks following ketamine exposure. Among ketamine remitters, 3 of 7 retained remission until at least 4 weeks following the last ketamine exposure, with 2 retaining remission through 8 weeks following ketamine exposure. Ketamine nonresponders did not appear to benefit from CBT. CONCLUSIONS: CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Well-powered randomized controlled trials are warranted to further investigate this treatment combination as a way to sustain ketamine's antidepressant effects.", "doi": "10.1159/000457960", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28490030/", "secondary_title": "Psychother Psychosom", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

METHOD: In this case series, fifty-three older adults (M(age) = 67, SD = 6; 57% female [n = 30]) received 4 IV ketamine infusions, administered over 1-2 weeks. Effectiveness of IV ketamine was measured using the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16 (QIDS-SR16) approximately 2 days after infusions 1-3, and 1-2 weeks after infusion 4. Safety was measured as hemodynamic changes before, during, immediately after, and 20 minutes after each infusion. Tolerability was assessed via systematic reporting of treatment-emergent adverse events during and after each infusion, in addition to symptoms of dissociation measured using the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale. Partial response (25%-50% symptomatic improvement from baseline), response (≥50% symptomatic improvement from baseline), clinically significant improvements (≥25% symptomatic improvement from baseline), and remission rates (QIDS-SR16 ≤5) were also calculated.

Lapidus et al. reported that intranasal ketamine was tolerable and effective in major depression. Thus, we hypothesized that intranasal ketamine administration in OCD patients would be similarly tolerated and yield a greater proportion of treatment responders than midazolam at 1 week post‐administration. Methods: With IRB approval, OCD outpatients (aged 18‐55) were recruited (September 2014 to May 2015). Eligible patients met criteria for OCD (both DSM‐IV and DSM‐5), were at least moderately symptomatic (Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale [Y‐BOCS (6, 7)] score≥ 16), and on stable psychotropic medication doses for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [17 item; HDRS(8)>25) or comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that made participation unsafe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intranasal ketamine 50 mg or intranasal midazolam 4 mg. Ketamine was delivered using the administration protocol of a prior intranasal ketamine study in depression. An independent evaluator, blind to treatment, evaluated OCD and depression symptoms at baseline and one week after drug administration. Treatment response was defined a priori as ≥ 35% Y‐BOCS score reduction. Patients randomized to midazolam were offered open‐label intranasal ketamine 50 mg after study completion. Results: Of the 23 adults with OCD who contacted the clinic to participate in pharmacological studies, 20 (87%) were screened and determined eligible for study participation. Of those 20 adults, 15 (75%) refused study participation due to not wanting intranasal medication, 6 (40%) of whom endorsed fear of contamination from the nasal applicator. After two participants completed the study, we discontinued it due to poor tolerability and low enrollment rate as detailed below. Subject #1 was a 36‐year‐old African‐American male with moderate OCD without depression (YBOCS = 21; HDRS = 1), and taking no medications at baseline. He was randomized to 50mg intranasal ketamine. Upon administration, he showed visible signs of discomfort (e.g., wrinkled nose, upper lip retraction, recoiling), stating “this is very unpleasant in my nose ‐ isn't there another way for me to get this?” but wanted to continue the study. Side effects included dissociation (e.g., body feeling unusually large, colors seemed brighter than expected, and time slowed) that lasted for 45 min after administration. One week after administration, he did not meet treatment response criteria (YBOCS = 19; HDRS = 0). Subject #2 was a 20‐year‐old Caucasian female (on stable dose of sertraline 125 mg daily for OCD and divalproate 250 mg daily for migraines) with severe OCD and moderate depression (YBOCS = 33 and HDRS = 18). She was randomized to midazolam 4 mg. She wrinkled her nose and complained of an unpleasant “bitter taste” and “stinging” in the nose; but wanted to continue the study. She reported lightheadedness and perceptual changes (i.e., sensation of having shrunk) 30 min after administration, which resolved by 60 min after administration; she also reported headache that resolved by 180 min after administration. One week post midazolam administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, but her depressive symptoms improved from moderate to mild (YBOCS =35; HDRS = 10). She was offered and accepted open treatment with intranasal ketamine. Upon administration she frowned, wrinkled her nose, opened her mouth with tongue extension and complained of unpleasant taste, stating, “I would much prefer this in my vein than in my nose.” She also reported nausea and headache that resolved 110 minutes postadministration. One week after keta ine administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, though her depressive symptom severity met criteria for remission (YBOCS = 32, HDRS =2). Conclusions: Contrary to our hypotheses, 1) nasal delivery was poorly tolerated in the first two study participants, and 2) neither patient met OCD response criteria one week after ketamine administration. As a result of observed verbal and physical cues of patient's discomfort during nasal delivery and difficulty enrolling study participants, the study was discontinued. The discomfort reactions to intranasal ketamine were specific to the insertion of the nasal applicator and the spray method of delivery, rather than to medication side effects. In contrast, in prior studies of ketamine conducted by C.I.R., placement of the IV and ketamine administration were well tolerated. Enrollment rates for this study were very low (of the 20 screened eligible participants, only 2 [10%] agreed to participate over 9 months), compared to significantly higher rates in C.I.R.'s studies in the same clinic with IV ketamine. Regarding our finding that neither patient met OCD treatment response criteria, our results may simply reflect subgroups of OCD patients that do and do not respond to ketamine (as indicated by contrasting prior publications on the efficacy of IV ketamine in OCD). By chance, the study participants (n = 2) may be in the subgroup that does not respond to ketamine.

{"record_id": 7036, "keywords": "", "text": "The effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD) on the Positive Valence Systems: A Research Domain Criteria (RDoC)-Informed Systematic Review.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: The renewed interest in psychedelic research provides growing evidence of potentially unique effects on various aspects of reward processing systems. Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, as proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health, we aim to synthesize the existing literature concerning the impact of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the RDoC's Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain, and to identify potential avenues for further research. METHODS: Two LSD-related terms (lysergic acid diethylamide and LSD) and 13 PVS-related terms (reward, happiness, bliss, motivation, reinforcement learning, operant, conditioning, satisfaction, decision making, habit, valence, affect, mood) were used to search electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO, and Web of Science for relevant articles. A manual search of the reference list resulted in nine additional articles. After screening, articles and data were evaluated and included based on their relevance to the objective of investigating the effects of LSD on the PVS. Articles and data were excluded if they did not provide information about the PVS, were observational in nature, lacked comparators or reference groups, or were duplicates.

Data from the included articles were collected and structured based on the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix, specifically focusing on the PVS domain and its three constituent constructs: reward responsiveness, reward learning, and reward valuation. RESULTS: We reviewed 28 clinical studies with 477 participants. Lysergic acid diethylamide, assessed at self-report (23 studies), molecular (5 studies), circuit (4 studies), and paradigm (3 studies) levels, exhibited dose-dependent mood improvement (20 short-term and 3 long-term studies). The subjective and neural effects of LSD were linked to the 5-HT(2A) receptor (molecular). Animal studies (14 studies) suggested LSD could mildly reinforce conditioned place preference without aversion and reduce responsiveness to other rewards. Findings on reward learning were inconsistent but hinted at potential associative learning enhancements. Reward valuation measures indicated potential reductions in effort expenditure for other reinforcers. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with our previous work, which indicated classical psychedelics, primarily serotonin 2A receptor agonists, enhanced reward responsiveness in healthy individuals and patient populations. Lysergic acid diethylamide exhibits a unique profile in the reward learning and valuation constructs.

METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is a randomised, placebo-controlled and double-blinded trial aiming to determine the effect of esketamine on moderate-to-severe depressive symptoms in patients undergoing major surgery. Five hundred and sixty-four participants, aged 18-65 years old, undergoing major surgery will be randomly allocated into the esketamine and placebo groups at a 1:1 ratio. Esketamine or placebo will be given intravenously at the same speed on suturing the incision by anaesthesiologists in charge who are blinded to the randomisation. In the esketamine group, the total dosage of esketamine will be 0.2 mg/kg body weight. To estimate the efficacy and safety endpoints, blinded evaluation by trained researchers will be completed at 3 days, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The primary outcome is the remission rate at the third postoperative day. The secondary outcomes include depression-related scores, severe pain events and safety-related endpoints such as psychotic symptoms, manic symptoms and dissociative symptoms. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Beijing Tiantan Hospital, Capital Medical University, Beijing, China on 30 October 2020 (KY-2020-058-02).

Five hundred and sixty-four participants, aged 18-65 years old, undergoing major surgery will be randomly allocated into the esketamine and placebo groups at a 1:1 ratio. Esketamine or placebo will be given intravenously at the same speed on suturing the incision by anaesthesiologists in charge who are blinded to the randomisation. In the esketamine group, the total dosage of esketamine will be 0.2 mg/kg body weight. To estimate the efficacy and safety endpoints, blinded evaluation by trained researchers will be completed at 3 days, 5 days, 1 month, 3 months and 6 months after surgery. The primary outcome is the remission rate at the third postoperative day. The secondary outcomes include depression-related scores, severe pain events and safety-related endpoints such as psychotic symptoms, manic symptoms and dissociative symptoms.

Participants were adults aged 21 to 65 years with a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition diagnosis of MDD of at least 60 days' duration and moderate or greater symptom severity. Exclusion criteria included history of psychosis or mania, active substance use disorder, and active suicidal ideation with intent.

Subjects reported a wide range of adverse effects including anxiety problems, depression, mood swings, feelings of paranoia, and panic attacks. Sleep and appetite disturbances were the most commonly reported problems. About half of all subjects reported depression and paranoid feelings associated with their stimulant use. Many of those reporting problems stated that these were mild. However, for all drugs, a substantial minority of users reported adverse effects which they rated as 'severe'. Between 30 and 55% of the sample reported having had at least one 'severe' adverse effect (30% cocaine, 35% Ecstasy and 55% amphetamine). There were clear differences between the different drugs in the likelihood and reported severity of adverse effects.

Results: Symptom severity was a more important correlate of alcohol use disorder and substance use than symptom type.

This study examined the likelihood of alcohol use disorder and substance use among individuals with varying depression and anxiety symptoms and severity thereof. Differences across sex were also examined. Methods: Using data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative sample from the United States (N = 43,093), separate logistic regressions estimated the odds of lifetime alcohol use disorder, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, and comorbid substance use across psychiatric symptom clusters controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity. Results: Symptom severity was a more important correlate of alcohol use disorder and substance use than symptom type. In particular, the odds ratio of lifetime use of depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens, or any combination of these types of substances were higher for individuals with either severe depression or severe depression and anxiety relative to a healthy control. Moreover, the odds of having a diagnosis of lifetime alcohol use disorder were higher for individuals with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and both depression and anxiety, relative to healthy individuals. Those with mild depression were more likely to engage in substance use than individuals with anxiety alone. Patterns of association among males and females were highly consistent. Conclusions: The findings highlight an enhanced risk of alcohol and substance use among individuals with severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms above what is seen among individuals with less severe symptomatology. In addition, this study shows a unique risk posed by the presence of depression on substance use. This study offers a framework for future studies to examine the causal mechanisms explaining the connection between psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.", "doi": "10.1080/15504263.2020.1784498", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32657223/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Dual Diagnosis", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Parallel-group or cross-over randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing single intravenous infusion of ketamine or a non-ketamine NMDAR antagonist v. placebo/pseudo-placebo in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or bipolar depression (BD) were included in the analyses.

RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs (nine ketamine studies: n = 234; five non-ketamine NMDAR antagonist studies: n = 354; MDD = 554, BD = 34), lasting 10.0 ± 8.8 days, were meta-analysed.

CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine, but less so of non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists, has ultra-rapid efficacy for MDD and BD, lasting for up to 1 week. Development of easy-to-administer, repeatedly given NMDAR antagonists without risk of brain toxicity is of critical importance.", "doi": "10.1017/s0033291716000064", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26867988/", "secondary_title": "Psychol Med", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Few functional consequences of MDMA-induced serotonin neurotoxicity have been identified, either in animals or humans. This study sought to determine whether individuals with a history of MDMA use showed evidence of executive dysfunction. Material and methods: Two groups of young individuals were compared: 24 abstinent MDMA users who had taken MDMA at least once and 24 controls who had never taken MDMA. Each MDMA user completed a questionnaire regarding the characteristics of their MDMA use and all participants completed a questionnaire regarding other recreational drug experience. The Behavioural Assessment of the Dysexecutive Syndrome (BADS) was used to measure executive function in all participants. Results: Evidence of impairment was found on two subtests of the BADS and in terms of a Total Profile Score.

Future research should examine the safety and pharmacokinetics of 5-MeO-DMT administration in humans using rigorous experimental designs.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881118769063", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29708042/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

This study aimed to present a comprehensive review of the current state of the field by applying a systematic search strategy for articles on the effectiveness and tolerability of four psychedelic-assisted therapies (psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA], and ayahuasca) for adults with symptoms of depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Psychometric scores and adverse events were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis models with Hedges' g bias-corrected standardized mean differences (g) and rate ratios (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CI). Bias evaluation followed PRISMA and Cochrane guidelines. Eighteen studies were identified, which suggested that psychedelic therapies were well tolerated and presented a large effect size for the management of depression symptoms in a transdiagnostic population with psilocybin (g = -1.92, 95% CI, -2.73 to -1.11) and MDMA (g = -0.71; 95% CI, -1.39 to -0.03).

We explored associations between changes in RSFC and psilocybin-induced phenomenology as well as changes in psychological measures and neocortex serotonin 2A receptor binding.

Some of this work has shown how the nature of the subjective drug experience relates to short and long‐term health outcomes. These studies have broadly found that greater mystical experiences (i.e., a construct reflecting unity, sacredness and noetic, positive mood, transcendence of time and space, and ineffability) are associated with greater positive clinical benefit. Prior research has relied on self‐reported, standardized scales to evaluate subjective experience and the extent to which similar relationships may exist using alternative modes of assessment is unclear. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to apply a linguistic analysis to compare narrative drug experiences completed after double‐blind administration of psilocybin (a classic psychedelic) and an active drug comparator, methylphenidate. A secondary aim was to evaluate the relationship between linguistic features and traditional subjective effect scales. Methods: Healthy participants (N = 36) completed a doubleblind, crossover study in which oral psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) or visually matched oral methylphenidate (40 mg/70 kg) were administered in a counterbalanced order. Standardized questionnaires of subjective drug effects including mystical experience and challenging effects were completed. Participants were also asked to complete an open‐ended narrative describing the session. Computerized text analysis was conducted using Linguistic Inquiry Word Count (LIWC) 2015 software with outputs included linguistic processes (total word count, words/sentence), and word categories including psychological processes (affective language), and higher‐order linguistic domains (analytical thinking, clout, authentic, and emotional tone). Analyses first compared psilocybin and methylphenidate sessions using within‐subjects t‐tests with effect sizes summarized as Cohen's dz. Textual features identified as significantly different between groups were then compared using one‐sample t tests to normative expressive writing data samples (6,179 files containing 2,526,709 words) collected in (nonpsychedelic) experimental studies in which participants were asked to write about deeply emotional topics (e.g., a personally upsetting experience). Finally, significant textual features were evaluated for their association with mystical and challenging experience questionnaires using Spearman correlations. Results: Narratives were longer for psilocybin sessions (mean word count = 1784 words) than for methylphenidate sessions (mean word count = 1149 words) (p = .004, dz = 0.52). Comparisons by condition indicated that psilocybin narratives contained lower scores on the higher‐order construct of “Analytical Thinking” (p = .002, dz = ‐0.57). Psilocybin narratives also had a higher occurrence of impersonal pronouns (e.g., it, it's; p < .001, dz = 0.82), auxiliary verbs (e.g., will, have; p = .003, dz = 0.53), and certainty language (e.g. always, never; p < .001, dz = 0.78), and lower occurrence of relativity language (e.g., exit; p = .003, dz = ‐0.53), work language (e.g., job; p = .009, dz = ‐0.46), and leisure language (e.g., movie; p < .001, dz = ‐0.70). Comparisons of psilocybin values to normed “expressive writing” samples indicated the former had higher analytic writing scores (p < .001, d = 1.02), and fewer auxiliary verbs (p = .002, d = ‐0.55), relativity language (p = .003, d = ‐0.53), and work language (p < .001, d = ‐3.51). Higher challenging experience scores were related to lower Analytical Thinking (r = ‐.46, p = .01), less relativity language (r = ‐.37, p = .04), and more impersonal pronouns (r = .40, p = .03). Mystical experience scores were not significantly associated with linguistic features (absolute r values = .05 to .33). Conclusions: Qualitative narratives of psilocybin experiences contained linguistic features that departed from both a drug comparator (methylphenidate) and large sample normat ve data. Notably, these linguistic features showed only modest overlap with standardized, quantitative scales suggesting they index unique aspects of the subjective drug experience.

Results: The durations of spontaneous respiratory recovery from seizure termination, end seizure to complete consciousness and recovery in the group A was significantly lower than the group B (P<0.001). However, the mean of systolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure after the end of seizure was significantly less in the group A than the group B, but the mean of SPO2 in the fifth minute in the group B was significantly lower than the group A. However, the frequency of nausea and muscle pain in the group B was significantly higher than the group A. Conclusion: The addition of dexmedetomidine to ketamine in the candidate patients for ECT can shorten the duration of seizure, recovery time, respiratory depression, and also reduce complications such as nausea, muscle pain and oxygen depletion.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Koomesh", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

The authors conducted an active-placebo-controlled study of ketamine's safety and efficacy in adolescents. METHODS: In this proof-of-concept randomized, double-blind, single-dose crossover clinical trial, 17 adolescents (ages 13-17) with a diagnosis of major depressive disorder received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg over 40 minutes), and the alternate compound 2 weeks later. All participants had previously tried at least one antidepressant medication and met the severity criterion of a score >40 on the Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised. The primary outcome measure was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) 24 hours after treatment. RESULTS: A single ketamine infusion significantly reduced depressive symptoms 24 hours after infusion compared with midazolam (MADRS score: midazolam, mean=24.13, SD=12.08, 95% CI=18.21, 30.04; ketamine, mean=15.44, SD=10.07, 95% CI=10.51, 20.37; mean difference=-8.69, SD=15.08, 95% CI=-16.72, -0.65, df=15; effect size=0.78).

Given the clear need for improved treatment of socio‐cognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. Methods: This study assessed the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in 21 healthy volunteers using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. A double‐ blind, randomized, cross‐over design was applied with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two sessions at least 10 days apart. Results: The neural response to social exclusion was reduced in the dorsal anterior cingulated cortex (peak: x=6,y=26,z=22,p<0.05,FWE) after psilocybin administration versus placebo. Emotional empathy was increased after psilocybin administration (F(1,31)=7.09,p0.27). Conclusions: These results indicate that the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio‐cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Biological psychiatry", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

A 0.5mg/kg ketamine infusion facilitated the glutamatergic neurotransmission in the SMA and dACC, which may be responsible for the persistent antidepressant effect of ketamine much beyond its half-life.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2017.09.008", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28922734/", "secondary_title": "J Affect Disord", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Accordingly, in the first of two separate studies, these variables were investigated in three groups: (1) MDMA group--recreational ecstasy users (who also used other illicit substances); (2) polydrug controls--who had never taken ecstasy, but otherwise had drug histories and personal characteristics similar to the ecstasy users; and (3) nondrug controls--who had never used illicit drugs, but had similar personal characteristics. All participants completed mood (Likert) scales, personality questionnaires (which included the impulsiveness, venturesomeness and empathy questionnaire-IVE), spatial span and \"Tower of London\" (TOL) tests, and a behavioural measure of impulsivity, the matching familiar figures test (MFF20). There were no group differences in mood, anxiety, anger/hostility, and cognitive performance, but the MDMA group committed significantly more errors in the MFF20. Subsequently, a larger sample of participants were administered mood (the General Health Questionnaire or GHQ) and personality (IVE) questionnaires before the administration of a TOL test, followed by the MFF20, and a second TOL test. Although there were no group differences in TOL performance, ecstasy users were again found to commit more errors in the MFF20 than polydrug users. Furthermore, the GHQ and IVE scores of the ecstasy users in the second study indicated, respectively, that they were more psychologically disturbed and impulsive than nondrug controls. The combined data from the two studies indicated that ecstasy users exhibited elevated impulsivity on both self-report and behavioral measures and that those who had taken the most ecstasy had the most elevated trait impulsiveness scores. These findings are consistent with previous evidence that elevated levels of impulsivity in humans are associated with reduced levels of serotonergic function.", "doi": "10.1016/s0893-133x(98)00012-8", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9718589/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Methods: Thirty-five ecstasy users and 62 non-ecstasy users completed a computer-based, verbal paired-associates learning task. Participants attempted to learn eight sequentially presented word pairs. After all eight had been presented, the first member of each pair was displayed and participants attempted to recall the second. Eight trials were administered. Correct responses on each trial, forgetting at various levels of learning, perseveration errors and the rate at which the associations were learned (trials to completion) were all recorded. Results: MANOVA revealed that ecstasy users performed worse overall and subsequent ANOVAs showed that users performed significantly worse on virtually all measures. Regression analysis revealed that over half of the ecstasy-group related variance in trials to completion was attributable to group differences in initial learning and forgetting. In relation to forgetting, it appears that cannabis use may be an important determinant. In relation to rate of learning (trials to completion) and initial learning, both ecstasy and cannabis may be implicated.

METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, two weeks clinical trial we studied the effects of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) in a group of 27 hospitalized depressive patients. RESULTS: Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen´s d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor-ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. CONCLUSION: The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. This relationship could be mediated by the initial steps of ketamine's action, trough NMDA receptors, shared by both ketamine's clinical effects.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Neuro Endocrinol Lett", "annotation": "Substance(s)"}

The high rate of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia raises questions about how nicotine modulates putative NMDA receptor hypofunction in the illness. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation on NMDA receptor hypofunction by examining the interactive effects of nicotine, a nAChR agonist, and ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on behavioral and neurophysiological measures in healthy human volunteers. Methods: From an initial sample of 17 subjects (age range 18–55 years), 8 subjects successfully completed 4 test sessions, each separated by at least 3 days, during which they received ketamine or placebo and two injections of nicotine or placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced manner. Schizophrenia-like effects Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, perceptual alterations Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale, subjective effects Visual Analog Scale and auditory event-related brain potentials (mismatch negativity, MMN; P300) were assessed during each test session. Results: Consistent with existing studies, ketamine induced transient schizophrenia-like behavioral effects. P300 was reduced and delayed by ketamine regardless of whether it was elicited by a target (P3b) or novel (P3a) stimulus, while nicotine only reduced the amplitude of P3a. Nicotine did not rescue P300 from the effects of ketamine; the interactions of ketamine and nicotine were not significant. While nicotine significantly reduced MMN amplitude, ketamine did not. Conclusion: Nicotine failed to modulate ketamine-induced neurophysiological and behavioral effects in this preliminary study. Interestingly, ketamine reduced P3b amplitude and nicotine reduced P3a amplitude, suggesting independent roles of NMDA receptor and nAChR in the generation of P3b and P3a, respectively.

In this study, we aimed to substantiate these findings by using the more active enantiomer (S)-ketamine. (S)-ketamine has a threefold higher affinity for the NMDA receptor, but relatively little is known about its specific effects on human motor cortex excitability. Eleven healthy subjects (two female) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with four treatment conditions: either placebo or one of three subanesthetic doses of intravenous (S)-ketamine (serum target 10, 30 and 50 ng/ ml, respectively). We assessed intracortical inhibition and facilitation using a paired-pulse TMS-paradigm. Resting motor threshold and cortical silent period were assessed as additional parameters. Solely at highest (S)-ketamine concentrations, intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced and intracortical facilitation strongly tended to be enhanced. In addition, we found a tendency to a prolonged silent period, while resting motor threshold was unaffected. We conclude that subanesthetic doses of (S)-ketamine show an enhancement on excitability in human motor cortex. Similar to findings using the racemic mixture of ketamine, the effect may be due to an increase in non-NMDA glutamatergic transmission which outweighs the NMDA receptor blockade.

Eleven healthy subjects (two female) participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with four treatment conditions: either placebo or one of three subanesthetic doses of intravenous (S)-ketamine (serum target 10, 30 and 50 ng/ ml, respectively). We assessed intracortical inhibition and facilitation using a paired-pulse TMS-paradigm. Resting motor threshold and cortical silent period were assessed as additional parameters. Solely at highest (S)-ketamine concentrations, intracortical inhibition was significantly reduced and intracortical facilitation strongly tended to be enhanced. In addition, we found a tendency to a prolonged silent period, while resting motor threshold was unaffected. We conclude that subanesthetic doses of (S)-ketamine show an enhancement on excitability in human motor cortex. Similar to findings using the racemic mixture of ketamine, the effect may be due to an increase in non-NMDA glutamatergic transmission which outweighs the NMDA receptor blockade.

The participants received either 200 μg of LSD (n = 8) or 20 μg of LSD with an open-label crossover to 200 μg of LSD after the initial blinded treatment was unmasked (n = 4). At the 2-month follow-up, positive trends were found via the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) in reductions in trait anxiety (p = 0.033) with an effect size of 1.1, and state anxiety was significantly reduced (p = 0.021) with an effect size of 1.2, with no acute or chronic adverse effects persisting beyond 1 day after treatment or treatment-related serious adverse events. STAI reductions were sustained for 12 months. These results indicate that when administered safely in a methodologically rigorous medically supervised psychotherapeutic setting, LSD can reduce anxiety, suggesting that larger controlled studies are warranted.", "doi": "10.1097/nmd.0000000000000113", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24594678/", "secondary_title": "J Nerv Ment Dis", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

In all cases, participants will begin by receiving a bolus dose of 0.3mg/kg intravenous ketamine, to be immediately followed by a ketamine only intravenous infusion of 0.15mg/kg/hr for one hour (total ketamine infusion of three hours for each study arm). After this one‐hour ketamine only period, participants will then receive either: ‐Receive three 25mcg intravenous injections of Fentanyl at 1.5, 2 and 2.5 hrs after ketamine infusion commencement (if in KET/FENT arm) OR ‐Receive additional 0.7mcg/kg/hr intravenous infusion of Dexmedetomidine commencing one hour post ketamine‐only infusion, for a duration of two hours (if in KET/DEX arm). CONDITION: Acute care Drugged Driving Neurocognition PRIMARY OUTCOME: Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and driving performance (highway driving scenario). Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and neurocognitive ability (CANTAB computerised battery). Associations between the treatment combinations (Ketamine/Fentanyl or Ketamine/Dexmedetomidine) and objective and subjective sedation (Visual Analogue Scale and Algometer). ; ; Objective and subjective sedation will be taken as a composite. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Level of alertness over time as a function of treatment. This will be assessed using subjective alertness questions which comprise part of the CANTAB battery. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Aged between 21 and 45 years. Hold a full drivers licence (no ‘P’ plates). No known allergic reaction to ketamine or other related opioids.

Rationale: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. Objectives: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. Results: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose–response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively.

Drugs of both classes are being pursued as novel treatments for mood disorders. While classic and dissociative hallucinogens have different pharmacologic mechanisms of action, they may have similar subjective and neuropsychological effects. The objective of this double‐blind, placebo controlled crossover study was to compare the neuropsychological effects of multiple doses of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin with the effects of a single high dose of the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan. Methods: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 F, 9M) completed five drug administration sessions lasting 6 to 8 hours each. During each session, volunteers self‐administered capsules containing placebo, one of three doses (10, 20, and 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin, or a dose dextromethorphan (DXM; 400 mg/70 kg).

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial involving patients referred to ECT clinics for treatment-resistant major depression. Patients with treatment-resistant major depression without psychosis were recruited and assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ketamine or ECT. During an initial 3-week treatment phase, patients received either ECT three times per week or ketamine (0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight over 40 minutes) twice per week. The primary outcome was a response to treatment (i.e., a decrease of ≥50% from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression). The noninferiority margin was -10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included scores on memory tests and patient-reported quality of life. After the initial treatment phase, the patients who had a response were followed over a 6-month period.

Personality relates to mental health and can be used to probe the nature of PT s therapeutic action. Methods: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, active comparator controlled trial involving patients with moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, over a core 6-week trial period. Five-Factor model personality domains, Big Five Aspect Scale Openness aspects, Absorption, and Impulsivity were measured at Baseline, Week 6, and Month 6 follow-up. Results: PT was associated with decreases in neuroticism (B = ?0.63), introversion (B = ?0.38), disagreeableness (B = ?0.47), impulsivity (B = ?0.40), and increases in absorption (B = 0.32), conscientiousness (B = 0.30), and openness (B = 0.23) at week 6, with neuroticism (B = ?0.47) and disagreeableness (B = ?0.41) remaining decreased at month6. Escitalopram Treatment (ET) was associated with decreases in neuroticism (B = ?0.38), disagreeableness(B = ?0.26), impulsivity (B = ?0.35), and increases in openness (B = 0.28) at week 6, with neuroticism (B = ?0.46) remaining decreased at month 6. No significant between-condition differences were observed. Conclusions: Personality changes across both conditions were in a direction consistent with improved mental health. With the possible exception of trait absorption, there were no compelling between-condition differences warranting conclusions regarding a selective action of PT (v. ET) on personality; however, post-ET changes in personality were significantly moderated by pre-trial positive expectancy for escitalopram, whereas expectancy did not moderate response to PT. © 2023 Cambridge University Press.

However, in some cases such delivery may be harmful to nasal and olfactory epithelia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of long-term intermittent treatment with esketamine nasal spray, taken in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (AD), on olfactory function and nasal tolerability in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: A total of 1142 patients with TRD participated from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III studies: three short-term studies (two in patients aged 18-64 years, one in patients ≥65 years), and one long-term maintenance study of esketamine nasal spray + AD versus placebo nasal spray + AD. Across the four studies, assessments were performed at 208 sites in 21 countries. Olfactory function was measured using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT(®)) and the single-staircase Snap & Sniff(®) Odor Detection Threshold Test (S&S-T). Nasal tolerability, including nasal examinations and a quantitative, self-administered nasal symptom questionnaire (NSQ), was also assessed. Data were analyzed using analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Of 1142 participants, 734 were women (64.3%). The mean age of all participants ranged from 45.7 to 70.0 years across the studies. Overall, 855 patients received esketamine nasal spray + AD and 432 received placebo nasal spray + AD. Objective evaluation of nasal function showed no evidence of an adverse impact following esketamine administration. Based on the UPSIT(®) and S&S-T results, intranasal administration of esketamine had no effect on the odor identification or threshold test scores compared with placebo nasal spray + oral AD. Similarly, repeated administration with esketamine nasal spray had no meaningful impact on assessments of nasal function. No dose-response relationship was observed between esketamine doses and the olfactory test scores. Esketamine nasal spray was well tolerated, as indicated by responses on the NSQ and negative nasal examination findings. CONCLUSION: Findings from this analysis indicate that there was no evidence of adverse effect on either olfactory or nasal health measures with repeated intermittent administration of esketamine nasal spray at any dose over the course of short-term (4 weeks) or long-term (16-100 weeks) studies.

However, the optimal antidepressant dose remains unknown. We aimed to compare to active placebo the rapid acting antidepressant properties of a broad range of subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine among outpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A range of IV ketamine doses were compared to active placebo in the treatment of adult TRD over a 3-day period following a single infusion over 40 min. This was an outpatient study conducted across six US academic sites. Outpatients were 18-70 years old with TRD, defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at least two adequate treatment courses during the current depressive episode. Following a washout period, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the five arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single intravenous dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), a single dose of ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), and a single dose of midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (active placebo) (n = 19). The study assessments (HAM-D-6, MADRS, SDQ, PAS, CGI-S, and CGI-I) were performed at days 0, 1, 3 (endpoint), 5, 7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efficacy. The overall group × time interaction effect was significant for the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6. In post hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for multiple comparisons, standard dose (0.5 mg/kg) and high dose (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to active placebo; a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was significant only prior to adjustment (p = 0.02, p-adj = 0.14, d = -0.82 at day 1). Most of the interaction effect was due to differences at day 1, with no significant adjusted pairwise differences at day 3. This pattern generally held for secondary outcomes. The infusions of ketamine were relatively well tolerated compared to active placebo, except for greater dissociative symptoms and transient blood pressure elevations with the higher doses. Our results suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or consistent evidence for clinically meaningful efficacy of lower doses of IV ketamine.

Outpatients were 18-70 years old with TRD, defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at least two adequate treatment courses during the current depressive episode. Following a washout period, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the five arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single intravenous dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), a single dose of ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), and a single dose of midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (active placebo) (n = 19). The study assessments (HAM-D-6, MADRS, SDQ, PAS, CGI-S, and CGI-I) were performed at days 0, 1, 3 (endpoint), 5, 7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efficacy. The overall group × time interaction effect was significant for the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6. In post hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for multiple comparisons, standard dose (0.5 mg/kg) and high dose (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to active placebo; a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was significant only prior to adjustment (p = 0.02, p-adj = 0.14, d = -0.82 at day 1). Most of the interaction effect was due to differences at day 1, with no significant adjusted pairwise differences at day 3. This pattern generally held for secondary outcomes. The infusions of ketamine were relatively well tolerated compared to active placebo, except for greater dissociative symptoms and transient blood pressure elevations with the higher doses. Our results suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or consistent evidence for clinically meaningful efficacy of lower doses of IV ketamine.

We examine associations between adolescents' attitudes and beliefs towards ecstasy use; because most ecstasy users have a history of marijuana use, we estimate the association for three groups of adolescents: non-marijuana/ecstasy users, marijuana users (used marijuana at least once but never used ecstasy) and ecstasy users (used ecstasy at least once). Methods: Data from 5049 adolescents aged 12-18 years old who had complete weighted data information in Round 2 of the Restricted Use Files (RUF) of the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY). Data were analyzed using jackknife weighted multinomial logistic regression models. Results: Adolescent marijuana and ecstasy users were more likely to approve of marijuana and ecstasy use as compared to non-drug using youth. Adolescent marijuana and ecstasy users were more likely to have close friends who approved of ecstasy as compared to non-drug using youth. The magnitudes of these two associations were stronger for ecstasy use than for marijuana use in the final adjusted model. Our final adjusted model shows that approval of marijuana and ecstasy use was more strongly associated with marijuana and ecstasy use in adolescence than perceived risk in using both drugs. Conclusion: Information about the risks and consequences of ecstasy use need to be presented to adolescents in order to attempt to reduce adolescents' approval of ecstasy use as well as ecstasy experimentation. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Ketamine is often prescribed as an add-on to other drugs used in psychiatric patients, but clear information on drug-drug interactions is lacking. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of the pharmacodynamic interactions between ketamine and mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase-inhibitors, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants. Methods MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Results Twenty-four studies were included. For lithium, no significant interactions with ketamine were reported. Two out of 5 studies on lamotrigine indicated that the effects of ketamine were attenuated. Benzodiazepines were repeatedly shown to reduce the duration of ketamine's antidepressant effect.

Given the anatomical proximity, disruptions of the hypothalamic‐pituitary axis causing an AVP‐D could also disturb the oxytocin (OXT) system. OXT regulates socio‐emotional functioning, including fear reduction, attachment, emotion recognition, and empathy. Therefore, these psychological symptoms may be caused by an additional OXT deficiency. However, OXT deficiency has not been established as a pituitary entity, as no provocation test for OXT is currently available. Here, we aimed to investigate the OXT system stimulator 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') as a novel biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to reveal an OXT deficiency in patients with cDI. Methods: Randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over study in 15 patients with cDI and 15 matched healthy controls. Participants underwent a psychological baseline evaluation, including the assessment of anxiety levels using the State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), mood using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), and alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). Participants were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo first. OXT samples were collected at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 minutes after drug intake. Subjective effects in response to MDMA were assessed throughout the experiment. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma OXT concentration curve (AUC) after MDMA intake. Results: Already at baseline, patients compared with healthy controls, showed significantly higher scores in anxiety (STAI: 41 points [IQR 34‐48] vs. 28 points [24‐31]; p=0.02), alexithymia (TAS: 47 points [38‐59] vs. 30 points [29‐37; p=0.04), and depression symptoms (BDI: 6 points [3‐17] vs. 1 point [0‐2]; p=0.04). In response to MDMA stimulation, in patients, there was only a minimal OXT change with 66 pg/ml [16‐94], while in healthy controls, OXT increased by 658 pg/ml [355‐914]. The AUC was 15.8 times (1485%), i.e., 85,678 pg/ml (95%‐CI [‐10,800 to ‐63,356], p<0.001), lower in patients compared with healthy controls. This lack of OXT in patients was associated with lower subjective effects such as 'good drug effect,' 'feeling high,' 'satisfaction,' 'happy,' 'trust,' 'talkative,' 'openness,' and 'fear reduction' compared with healthy controls.

The AUC was 15.8 times (1485%), i.e., 85,678 pg/ml (95%‐CI [‐10,800 to ‐63,356], p<0.001), lower in patients compared with healthy controls. This lack of OXT in patients was associated with lower subjective effects such as 'good drug effect,' 'feeling high,' 'satisfaction,' 'happy,' 'trust,' 'talkative,' 'openness,' and 'fear reduction' compared with healthy controls. Conclusion: These results lay the groundwork for OXT deficiency as a hypothalamic‐pituitary entity. In patients with cDI, this lack in OXT was associated with reduced pro‐social, empathic, and anxiolytic effects.", "doi": "10.1210/jendso/bvad114.1307", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38596261/", "secondary_title": "Journal of the Endocrine Society", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

These findings suggest that psychedelics are associated with positive psychological characteristics and are consistent with prior reports suggesting efficacy in treatment of substance use disorders.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881117691453", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28196428/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

It has recently been shown that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or 'ecstasy' causes long-lasting alterations to brain structure and function in animals, and there is mounting evidence that recreational users of the drug show impairments in some aspects of cognitive functioning including memory for verbal information.

Methods. Eighty participants categorized as non-users, novice users, regular users or currently abstinent users of MDMA were assessed on tests of verbal IQ, reversed digit span, immediate and delayed recall of a prose passage and of a complex geometric figure and verbal fluency. Results. The four groups were well-matched for verbal IQ and on demographic variables.

The purpose of this trial was to test whether a single ketamine infusion improved treatment outcomes in cocaine-dependent adults engaged in mindfulness-based relapse prevention. METHODS: Fifty-five cocaine-dependent individuals were randomly assigned to receive a 40-minute intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (the control condition) during a 5-day inpatient stay, during which they also initiated a 5-week course of mindfulness-based relapse prevention. Cocaine use was assessed through self-report and urine toxicology. The primary outcomes were end-of-study abstinence and time to relapse (defined as first use or dropout). RESULTS: Overall, 48.2% of individuals in the ketamine group maintained abstinence over the last 2 weeks of the trial, compared with 10.7% in the midazolam group (intent-to-treat analysis). The ketamine group was 53% less likely (hazard ratio=0.47; 95% CI=0.24, 0.92) to relapse (dropout or use cocaine) compared with the midazolam group, and craving scores were 58.1% lower in the ketamine group throughout the trial (95% CI=18.6, 78.6); both differences were statistically significant. Infusions were well tolerated, and no participants were removed from the study as a result of adverse events.

Stress resilience is the ability to experience stress without developing significant psychopathology. Thus, enhancing stress resilience in at‐risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress‐induced psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience‐enhancing pharmaceuticals have been identified yet. Preclinical studies showed that the administration of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine one week prior to an acute stressor prevents the development of depressive‐like behavior in rodents. In this project we aimed to test if the stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies also to humans. Methods: This was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, proof of concept study wherein twenty‐four healthy subjects (n = 11 males) were randomized to receive a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or the psychoactive placebo control condition, midazolam (0.045 mg/kg), administered oneweek prior to an acute stress [the Trier Social Stress Test (TSST)]. The TSST is a validated and widely used acute stress protocol designed to evoke an acute stress response in humans. The TSST employs a combination of elements (public speaking, mental arithmetic, anticipation, social evaluation, unpredictability) that reliably produce stress in a majority of participants, and activates the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis and the sympathetic‐adrenal‐medullary (SAM) axis. Acute elevations of self‐reported of negative affect and anxiety are also reliably demonstrated. The primary endpoint of the study was change from baseline (pre‐TSST) in self‐reported stress measured by the anxious‐composed subscale of the Profile of Mood States Bipolar Scale (POMS‐Bi) immediately after the TSST. Salivary cortisol and alpha amylase were also measured at 15‐minute intervals following the stressor, as a proxies for HPA and SAM axis activity respectively. Effect sizes for differences in mean change from baseline (pre‐TSST) to outcome (post‐TSST) between treatment arms were computed as Cohen's d. The trial was registered at clinicaltrials.gov [NCT04173962]. Results: Thirty‐three subjects consented to participate in the trial. Of these, 24 (72.7%) were randomized, 6 (18.2%) were screen failures, and 3 (9.1%) were exited due to COVID‐19. Participants in the ketamine group (n=12) showed reduced levels of anxiety (mean change: 6.8 ± 5.8) compared to the midazolam group (n=12; mean change: 11.9 ± 8.6), as measured by the change in anxious‐composed sub‐score of the POMS from baseline (pre‐TSST) to immediately following the TSST; however the difference did not reach statistical significance (β=5.66; CI=‐0.34,11.60; p=.06). The effect size for the difference in change in means was Cohen's d=0.7, equivalent to a medium‐to‐large effect size. Compared with midazolam, ketamine was not associated with a significantly different trajectory in level of salivary cortisol (p=.09) or alpha amylase (p=.93) during or after the stressor. The effect size for the difference in change in means was Cohen's d=0.7 and 0.3, respectively. Of note, in a subgroup of subjects who displayed a stress response following the TSST, computed as an increase of at least 20% of salivary cortisol levels from baseline (pre‐TSST) to the peak (post‐TSST), subjects randomized to ketamine (n=7) showed reduced levels of salivary cortisol (F=6.1; df=1,8; p=.038) and salivary alpha‐amylase (F=4.8; df=1,8; p=.059) compared to those randomized to midazolam (n=6). Conclusions: While this proof‐of‐concept study did not meet its primary endpoint, ketamine administration was associated with a medium‐to‐large magnitude reduction in TSST‐induced anxiety levels compared to midazolam. Further, the effect of ketamine was significant on secondary biological endpoints within a subgroup of stress‐responders.

Acute psilocybin effects include reduced negative mood, increased positive mood, and reduced amygdala response to negative affective stimuli. However, no study has investigated the long-term, enduring impact of psilocybin on negative affect and associated brain function. Twelve healthy volunteers (7F/5M) completed an open-label pilot study including assessments 1-day before, 1-week after, and 1-month after receiving a 25 mg/70 kg dose of psilocybin to test the hypothesis that psilocybin administration leads to enduring changes in affect and neural correlates of affect. One-week post-psilocybin, negative affect and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli were reduced, whereas positive affect and dorsal lateral prefrontal and medial orbitofrontal cortex responses to emotionally-conflicting stimuli were increased. One-month post-psilocybin, negative affective and amygdala response to facial affect stimuli returned to baseline levels while positive affect remained elevated, and trait anxiety was reduced.

Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented. METHOD: A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic. RESULTS: Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin = 7, ayahuasca = 2, LSD = 1), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported.

This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants.

Further RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine with longer follow-up, which test the comparative efficacy of ketamine and the efficacy of repeated administrations.", "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011612.pub2", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26395901/", "secondary_title": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Recent pharmacologic studies indicate that glutamate dysfunction may produce increased functional connectivity. However, pharmacologic models of schizophrenia overlook effects of illness progression on PFC function. This study compared N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist effects in healthy volunteers with stages of schizophrenia with respect to PFC functional connectivity. METHODS: First, we tested ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity in healthy volunteers in a data-driven way (n = 19). Next, we compared healthy subjects (n = 96) with three clinical groups: individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (n = 21), people early in their course of schizophrenia (EC-SCZ) (n = 28), and patients with chronic illness (n = 20). Across independent analyses, we used data-driven global brain connectivity techniques restricted to PFC to identify functional dysconnectivity. RESULTS: Results revealed robust PFC hyperconnectivity in healthy volunteers administered ketamine (Cohen's d = 1.46), resembling individuals at high risk for schizophrenia and EC-SCZ. Hyperconnectivity was not found in patients with chronic illness relative to EC-SCZ patients.

With the current absence of approved pharmacological treatments, there is a desperate need for novel treatment avenues to be explored. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of psilocybin‐assisted therapy in the treatment of depression [1,2], obsessive‐compulsive disorder [3], addiction, and end of life psychological distress [2]. Additionally, a limited number of non‐clinical studies have reported positive outcomes following a psychedelic experience in those with eating disorders [4,5].

The trial has ethical and Medicines and Healthcare products Regulation Agency (MHRA) approval and is due to commence in 2021. Additionally, we outline how public patient involvement (PPI) has enriched our trial design. Methods: The aims of this within‐subject pilot study are: 1) to assess the feasibility and efficacy of treating anorexia nervosa with psilocybin, and 2) to use Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and electroencephalography (EEG) to examine the neuronal mechanisms underlying psilocybin treatment in this patient group.

{"record_id": 644, "keywords": "['music information retrieval', 'music perception', 'music theory', 'psilocybin']", "text": "Qualitative and Quantitative Features of Music Reported to Support Peak Mystical Experiences during Psychedelic Therapy Sessions.^\nPsilocybin is a classic (serotonergic) hallucinogen (\"psychedelic\" drug) that may occasion mystical experiences (characterized by a profound feeling of oneness or unity) during acute effects. Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience.

To test this hypothesis, depressed patients were pretreated with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, prior to receiving ketamine. Twenty patients suffering a major depressive episode were randomized to pretreatment with oral rapamycin (6 mg) or placebo 2 h prior to the intravenous administration of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in a double-blind cross-over design with treatment days separated by at least 2 weeks. Depression severity was assessed using Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Rapamycin pretreatment did not alter the antidepressant effects of ketamine at the 24-h timepoint. Over the subsequent 2-weeks, we found a significant treatment by time interaction (F((8,245)) = 2.02, p = 0.04), suggesting a prolongation of the antidepressant effects of ketamine by rapamycin.

Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted.

Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001).

The present study explored the nature of central executive deficits in ecstasy users. METHODS: In study 1, 27 ecstasy users and 34 non-users were assessed using tasks to tap memory updating (computation span; letter updating) and access to long-term memory (a semantic fluency test and the Chicago Word Fluency Test). In study 2, 51 ecstasy users and 42 non-users completed tasks that assess mental set switching (number/letter and plus/minus) and inhibition (random letter generation). RESULTS: MANOVA revealed that ecstasy users performed worse on both tasks used to assess memory updating and on tasks to assess access to long-term memory (C- and S-letter fluency). However, notwithstanding the significant ecstasy group-related effects, indices of cocaine and cannabis use were also significantly correlated with most of the executive measures. Unexpectedly, in study 2, ecstasy users performed significantly better on the inhibition task, producing more letters than non-users. No group differences were observed on the switching tasks. Correlations between indices of ecstasy use and number of letters produced were significant.

Methods: Adults with migraine headache, free from significant medical or psychiatric disease were selected for the study.

We applied dynamic causal modeling and Bayesian model selection to data from a recent ketamine study of the roving MMN paradigm, using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our modeling was guided by a predictive coding framework that unifies contemporary 'adaptation' and 'model adjustment' MMN theories. Comparing a series of dynamic causal models that allowed for different expressions of neuronal adaptation and synaptic plasticity, we obtained 3 major results: 1) We replicated previous results that both adaptation and short-term plasticity are necessary to explain MMN generation per se; 2) we found significant ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity, but not adaptation, and a selective ketamine effect on the forward connection from left primary auditory cortex to superior temporal gyrus; 3) this model-based estimate of ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity correlated significantly with ratings of ketamine-induced impairments in cognition and control. Our modeling approach thus suggests a concrete mechanism for ketamine effects on MMN that correlates with drug-induced psychopathology. More generally, this demonstrates the potential of modeling for inferring on synaptic physiology, and its pharmacological modulation, from electroencephalography data.

Our modeling was guided by a predictive coding framework that unifies contemporary 'adaptation' and 'model adjustment' MMN theories. Comparing a series of dynamic causal models that allowed for different expressions of neuronal adaptation and synaptic plasticity, we obtained 3 major results: 1) We replicated previous results that both adaptation and short-term plasticity are necessary to explain MMN generation per se; 2) we found significant ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity, but not adaptation, and a selective ketamine effect on the forward connection from left primary auditory cortex to superior temporal gyrus; 3) this model-based estimate of ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity correlated significantly with ratings of ketamine-induced impairments in cognition and control. Our modeling approach thus suggests a concrete mechanism for ketamine effects on MMN that correlates with drug-induced psychopathology. More generally, this demonstrates the potential of modeling for inferring on synaptic physiology, and its pharmacological modulation, from electroencephalography data.

Methods: Data were drawn from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH). Logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify the characteristics associated with the use of each of these drugs and of multiple drugs. Results: Approximately 20% of youths aged 16-23 reported having ever used one or more of these drugs. Less than 1% of club drug users used club drugs only, and 82% of them had ever used three or more drug classes. Females were more likely than males to report using multiple club drugs. Recent users of methamphetamine were most likely to be females and adolescents aged 16 or 17. Recent users of MDMA tended to be young adults aged 18-21 and residents of metropolitan areas. Most recent users of LSD were adolescents aged 16-19 and those in low-income families. Ketamine users were primarily employed youths. Staying in school and getting married were associated with decreased odds of club drug use. Club drug use was highly associated with the presence of criminal behaviors and recent alcohol abuse or dependence. Conclusions: Adolescents are more likely than young adults to use multiple drugs.
