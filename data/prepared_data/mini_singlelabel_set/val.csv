"3179","1","Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance.^\nRATIONALE: Although psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its acute and persisting effects. OBJECTIVES: This double-blind study evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were hallucinogen-naïve adults reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40 mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design, six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions. Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers. CONCLUSIONS: When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous scientific investigations of their causes and consequences."
"827","0","Increased hippocampal engagement during learning as a marker of sensitivity to psychotomimetic effects of δ-9-THC.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient δ-9-tetrahydrocannibidiol (THC) can induce transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate them in those with established psychosis. However, not everyone experience these effects, suggesting that certain individuals are particularly susceptible. The neural basis of this sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effects of THC is unclear. METHODS: We investigated whether individuals who are sensitive to the psychotomimetic effects of THC (TP) under experimental conditions would show differential hippocampal activation compared with those who are not (NP). We studied 36 healthy males under identical conditions under the influence of placebo or THC (10 mg) given orally, on two separate occasions, in a pseudo-randomized, double-blind, repeated measures, within-subject, cross-over design, using psychopathological assessments and functional MRI while they performed a verbal learning task. They were classified into those who experienced transient psychotic symptoms (TP; n = 14) following THC administration and those who did not (NP; n = 22). RESULTS: Under placebo conditions, there was significantly greater engagement of the left hippocampus (p < 0.001) in the TP group compared with the NP group during verbal encoding, which survived leave-one-out analysis. The level of hippocampal activation was directly correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.44, p = 0.008) with the severity of transient psychotic symptoms induced by THC. This difference was not present when we compared two subgroups from the same sample that were defined by sensitivity to anxiogenic effects of THC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that altered hippocampal activation during verbal encoding may serve as a marker of sensitivity to the acute psychotomimetic effects of THC."
"6172","1","Intravenous Esketamine on Prevention of Postoperative Depression in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.^\nSingle subanaesthetic doses of i.v. esketamine may significantly improve symptoms in psychiatric patients with major depression. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative depressive symptoms are common. This study hypothesizes that low‐dose esketamine has a preventive effect on postoperative depression. However, evidence in this aspect is insufficient. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine on POD for patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
"469","1","Oxytocin in response to MDMA provocation test in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): a single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can cause an arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus. Patients with this condition are at high risk of additional oxytocin deficiency owing to the close anatomical proximity of oxytocin-producing neurons; however, no conclusive evidence for such a deficiency has been reported. We aimed to use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), a strong activator of the central oxytocinergic system, as a biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to investigate oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). METHODS: This single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial included patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy controls (matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI) and was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. We used block randomisation to assign participants to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in the first experimental session; patients received the opposite treatment at the next session, with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between the two sessions. Participants and investigators assessing the outcomes were masked to assignment. Oxytocin concentrations were measured at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 min after MDMA or placebo. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma oxytocin concentration curve (AUC) after drug intake. The AUC was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed-effects model. Subjective drug effects were assessed throughout the study using ten-point visual analogue scales. Acute adverse effects were assessed before and 360 min after drug intake using a 66-item list of complaints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04648137. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2021, and May 1, 2022, we recruited 15 patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and 15 healthy controls. All participants completed the study and were included in the analyses. In healthy controls, median plasma oxytocin concentration was 77 pg/mL (IQR 59-94) at baseline and increased by 659 pg/mL (355-914) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 102 095 pg/mL (41 782-129 565); in patients, baseline oxytocin concentration was 60 pg/mL (51-74) and only slightly increased by 66 pg/mL (16-94) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 6446 pg/mL (1291-11 577). The effect of MDMA on oxytocin was significantly different between groups: the AUC for oxytocin was 82% (95% CI 70-186) higher in healthy controls than in patients (difference 85 678 pg/mL [95% CI 63 356-108 000], p<0·0001). The increase in oxytocin in healthy controls was associated with typical strong subjective prosocial, empathic, and anxiolytic effects, whereas only minimal subjective effects were observed in patients, in agreement with the lack of increase in oxytocin concentrations. The most frequently reported adverse effects were fatigue (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of appetite (ten [67%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of concentration (eight [53%] healthy controls and seven [47%] patients), and dry mouth (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients). In addition, two (13%) healthy controls and four (27%) patients developed transient mild hypokalaemia. INTERPRETATION: These findings are highly suggestive of clinically meaningful oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), laying the groundwork for a new hypothalamic-pituitary disease entity.

"8507","0","Current Perspective on MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nThe present paper discusses the current literature with regard to substance-assisted psychotherapy with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the development from MDMA's early application in psychotherapy to its present and future role in the treatment of PTSD. It is further attempted to increase the attention for MDMA's therapeutic potential by providing a thorough depiction of the scientific evidence regarding its theorized mechanism of action and potential harms of its application in the clinical setting (e.g., misattribution of therapeutic gains to medication instead of psychological changes). Empirical support for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, including the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails that have been conducted since 2008, is discussed. Thus far, an overall remission rate of 66.2% and low rates of adverse effects have been found in the six phase two trials conducted in clinical settings with 105 blinded subjects with chronic PTSD. The results seem to support MDMA's safe and effective use as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Even though preliminary studies may look promising, more studies of its application in a psychotherapeutic context are needed in order to establish MDMA as a potential adjunct to therapy."
"606","1","Assessment of alcohol and tobacco use disorders among religious users of ayahuasca.^\nThe aims of this study were to assess the impact of ceremonial use of ayahuasca-a psychedelic brew containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and β-carboline -and attendance at União do Vegetal (UDV) meetings on substance abuse; here we report the findings related to alcohol and tobacco use disorder. A total of 1,947 members of UDV 18+ years old were evaluated in terms of years of membership and ceremonial attendance during the previous 12 months. Participants were recruited from 10 states from all major regions of Brazil. Alcohol and tobacco use was evaluated through questionnaires first developed by the World Health Organization and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Analyses compared levels of alcohol and tobacco use disorder between the UDV and a national normative sample (n = 7,939). Binomial tests for proportions indicated that lifetime use of alcohol and tobacco was higher in UDV sample compared to the Brazilian norms for age ranges of 25-34 and over 34 years old, but not for the age range of 18-24 years old. However, current use disorders for alcohol and tobacco were significantly lower in the UDV sample than the Brazilian norms. Regression analyses revealed a significant impact of attendance at ayahuasca ceremonies during the previous 12 months and years of UDV membership on the reduction of alcohol and tobacco use disorder."
"2488","1","Phantom limb pain: sub hallucinogenic treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD 25).^\nOral treatment of phantom limb pain in five males and two females ranging in age from 25 to 78 years with subhallucinogenic doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) resulted in improvement in pain in five patients and reduction in use of analgesics. In two of the five patients improvement was striking and in the other three, pain and analgesic use were reduced moderately. LSD treatment was ineffective in two patients. Intravenous infusion or bolus injection of LSD-25, 10 ng/ml at 0.5 ml/min. resulted in facilitation of 5-HT venospasm. The findings suggest that LSD-25 facilitation of 5-HT activity occurs centrally consistent with the hypothesis of the central nature of phantom limb pain."
"9037","1","Verbal working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA.^\nPrevious research suggests that MDMA users are impaired in various aspects of cognitive functioning, however, it remains unclear whether they might experience deficits in established measures of verbal working memory functioning. In the present study current and previous MDMA users were compared with non-users on verbal working memory measures including reading and computation span. Both user groups were found to be impaired on the computation span measure while current users also exhibited impairment in reading span. The MDMA-related deficit on the computation span measure remained significant following the introduction of statistical controls for the potentially confounding effects of cannabis and other drugs. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on executive processes. It is suggested that MDMA may produce differential effects on specific components within a fractionated executive system. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"9491","0","A global systematic review and meta-analysis on illicit drug consumption rate through wastewater-based epidemiology.^\nWastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a complementary, well-established comprehensive, cost-effective, and rapid technique for monitoring of illicit drugs used in a general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to estimate the rank and consumption rate of illicit drugs through WBE studies. In the current study, the related investigations regarding the illicit drug consumption rate based on WBE were searched among the international databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Google scholar, and local database, Magiran from 2012 up to May 2019. The illicit drug consumption rate with 95% confidence intervals was pooled between studies by using random effect model. The heterogeneity was determined using I(2) statistics. Also, subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the possible effects of year and location of studies on observed heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of 37 articles indicates that the overall rank order of illicit drugs according to their pooled consumption rate can be summarized as tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis (7417.9 mg/day/1000 people) > cocaine (655.7 mg/day/1000 people) > morphine (384.9 mg/day/1000 people) > methamphetamine (296.2 mg/day/1000 people) > codeine (222.7 mg/day/1000 people) > methadone (200.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (126.3 mg/day/1000 people) > amphetamine (118.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (33.7 mg/day/1000 people). The pooled level rate was 190.16 mg/day/1000 people for benzoylecgonine (main urinary cocaine metabolite), 137.9 mg/day/1000 people for 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (main metabolite of cannabis), and 33.7 mg/day/1000 people for 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (main metabolite of methadone). The I(2) values for all selected drugs were 100% (P value < 0.001). The results of year subgroup indicated that the changes of heterogeneity for all selected drugs were nearly negligible. The heterogeneity within studies based on continents subgroup just decreased in America for drugs like 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (I(2) = 24.4%) and benzoylecgonine (I(2) = 94.1%). The outcome of this meta-analysis can be used for finding the illicit drugs with global serious problem in view of consumption rate (i.e., cannabis and cocaine) and helping authorities to combat them."
"2078","1","Dr. Leary's Concord Prison Experiment: a 34-year follow-up study.^\nThis study is a long-term follow-up to the Concord Prison Experiment, one of the best-known studies in the psychedelic psychotherapy literature. The Concord Prison Experiment was conducted from 1961 to 1963 by a team of researchers at Harvard University under the direction of Timothy Leary. The original study involved the administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy to 32 prisoners in an effort to reduce recidivism rates. This follow-up study involved a search through the state and federal criminal justice system records of 21 of the original 32 subjects, as well as personal interviews with two of the subjects and three of the researchers: Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Gunther Weil. The results of the follow-up study indicate that published claims of a treatment effect were erroneous. This follow-up study supports the emphasis in the original reports on the necessity of embedding psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy with inmates within a comprehensive treatment plan that includes post-release, nondrug group support programs. Despite substantial efforts by the experimental team to provide post-release support, these services were not made sufficiently available to the subjects in this study. Whether a new program of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy and post-release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed within the context of a new experiment."
"6844","0","Medicinal psychedelics for mental health and addiction: Advancing research of an emerging paradigm.^\nThe medical use of psychedelic substances (e.g. psilocybin, ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is attracting renewed interest, driven by a pressing need for research and development of novel therapies for psychiatric disorders, as well as promising results of contemporary studies. In this Viewpoint, we reflect upon the 'Clinical Memorandum on Psychedelics' recently released by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and note subsequent developments including the application for down-scheduling of psilocybin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine presently being considered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and approvals for access via the Special Access Scheme. We suggest that this field is worthy of rigorous research to assess potential benefits, address safety parameters and clarify therapeutic mechanisms. To this end, we outline recent research findings, provide an overview of current knowledge relating to mechanisms of action and discuss salient aspects of the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy treatment model. The sum of this research points towards medicinal psychedelics as a potential new class of psychiatric treatments when used within a medically supervised framework with integrated psychotherapeutic support. However, before widespread translation into clinical use can occur, appropriately designed and sufficiently powered trials are required to detect both potential positive and negative outcomes. Unique safety and regulatory challenges also need to be addressed. As for any new medical therapy, psychedelic research needs to be conducted in a rigorous manner, through the dispassionate lens of scientific enquiry. Carte blanche availability to practitioners, without specific protocols and appropriate training, would be potentially harmful to individuals and detrimental to the field."
"2800","1","Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^\nObjectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados."
"8180","1","Relationship of ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects in unipolar depression.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine and other NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists produce fast-acting antidepressant-like effects, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, two weeks clinical trial we studied the effects of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) in a group of 27 hospitalized depressive patients. RESULTS: Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen´s d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor-ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. CONCLUSION: The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. This relationship could be mediated by the initial steps of ketamine's action, trough NMDA receptors, shared by both ketamine's clinical effects."
"7744","1","Effects of methylphenidate and MDMA (ecstasy) on appraisal of erotic stimuli.^\nBackground: Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it is also increasingly misused recreationally and as cognitive enhancer (neuroenhancer). 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') is a popular recreational club drug mainly used due to its entactogenic properties, i.e. the drug is thought to enhance feelings of sociability, empathy, and closeness to others. Methylphenidate mainly enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas MDMA mainly increases brain serotonin levels. Additionally, both drugs increase noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore have also psychostimulant properties. It is well recognized that psychoactive substances affect sexual perception and behavior. Typically, dopaminergic psychostimulants including methamphetamine and cocaine are reported to enhance sexual drive and to increase sexual pleasure. In contrast, serotonergic drugs such as serotonin uptake inhibitors typically impair sexual arousal and functions (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty reaching orgasm). However, ecstasy users describe inconsistent effects on sexual desire and performance. Some users report feelings of emotional closeness while consuming Ecstasy but no desire for penetrative sex. Others report that ecstasy increased their sexual arousal and some use it specifically for sexual enhancement. It seems that MDMA induces well‐being and feelings of closeness to others accompanied by a sensual rather than a sexual enhancement. However, research on psychoactive drug use and sexual behavior is typically based on interviews of drug users and has mainly focused on sexual risk taking. It remains to be determined, whether methylphenidate and MDMA alter sexual arousal when measured objectively in a laboratory setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli after administration of single doses of methylphenidate, MDMA, or placebo. Methods: We evaluated effects of methylphenidate (40 mg), MDMA (75 mg) and placebo on subjective sexual arousal by viewing erotic pictures using a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled cross‐over design in 30 healthy subjects (15 men, 15 women). In the Sexual Arousal Task (SAT), participants had to evaluate 16 neutral, erotic (implicit sexual), or sexual (explicit sexual) color photographs taken from the International Affective Picture System and to rate how pleasant, exciting/arousing, attractive, likable or erotic they considered these pictures. Results: Methylphenidate significantly increased ratings of arousal compared with both placebo (p<0.01) and MDMA (p<0.001), but only for pictures with an explicit sexual content. Methylphenidate similarly tended to increase ratings of erotic compared with placebo (p<0.05) and MDMA (p<0.05) for pictures with explicit sexual content. MDMA did not alter ratings on any of the dimensions regardless of sexual content. There were no significant differences between male or female participants in any of the ratings or drug effects. Conclusion: Methylphenidate increased ratings of sexual excitation by visual stimuli with explicit sexual content. In contrast, MDMA had no such effects on sexual arousal. The findings indicate that pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic (methylphenidate) but not of serotonergic (MDMA) neurotransmission enhances sexual drive. It needs to be investigated whether sexual perception or even risk‐associated sexual behavior is altered in subjects using methylphenidate for cognitive enhancement or as treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."
"4927","0","Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis of presentations to an urban emergency department in Switzerland.^\nBackground Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy). Aims of the study To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence. Methods Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded. Results The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic. Conclusion Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances."
"123","0","Depression and suicide (Hungarian).^\nEvery form of depression involves a risk of suicide. It is particularly great in the phase of activation, but it is present in every phase of the disease. Short term but intensive psychotherapy was shown to be very beneficial in bringing the patients out of the phase of crisis. In cases of this nature the main consideration is that of gaining time. As a supplementary measure an appropriately selected course of suitable drugs is always indicated. The patient should be helped out of his constrictive mental state which is the principal symptom of depression and the presuicidal syndrome. Initial response should not deceive the therapist, since the risk of suicide still persists in a latent form. Causes which can influence the background of every depression, such as unfavourable external circumstances and severe physical illness should naturally also receive attention, in order to secure a lasting psychotherapeutic result. The numerous failures should not deter the efforts made in this respect."
