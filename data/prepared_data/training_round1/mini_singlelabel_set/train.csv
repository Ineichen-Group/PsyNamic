"6129","1","HIV+ Substance Users Released From Jail.^\nAim 1 Introduction: This first aim will be critical to successful implementation of the CHW‐DOORS intervention. Employing a formerly incarcerated CHW to assist individuals leaving prison in order to connect to healthcare has been successfully implemented in different settings, but it has not been applied specifically to HIV patients or those leaving jail (v. prison), nor has it been integrated into a community based organization. The objective of this aim is to adapt the evidence‐based CHW intervention to the HIV population and to the jail setting and to integrate the CHW into existing processes at DOORS and the outpatient HIV clinic system. Research Design. Aim 1.1: The first step of Aim 1 will be to train the CHW using the transitions clinic approach, add modules on HIV and substance use and familiarize the CHW with DOORS processes and HIV clinic workflow. Aim 1.2: The second step will be to complete qualitative interviews with stakeholders in three different settings‐ the jail, the HIV clinic and DOORS. All interviews will be semi‐structured, one‐on‐one interviews, with an estimated 4‐7 interviews in each setting. The structured component of the interview guide will prompt interviewee input on study design (e.g. recruitment, intervention, follow‐up visits), content of the intervention (e.g. high demand services) and an open‐ended component eliciting possible barriers to study implementation. Aim 1.3: The final step in Aim 1 will be to complete pilot testing with 5 subjects, which will focus on refining recruitment/enrollment protocols, streamlining study assessments and evaluating the intervention. Recruitment: In order to protect patient confidentiality, potential subjects will be referred by medical staff who provide clinical care to HIV+ inmates. When an inmate enters the Dallas County Jail, he/she is evaluated by a medical provider within 24 hours (medical assessment program, MAP). At this visit, the inmate can disclose any medical conditions that they have including HIV, in which case he/she will be referred to the jail HIV clinic (scheduled within 1‐7 days of jail entry). In addition, HIV testing is offered in an opt‐out manner when inmates have blood drawn for any reason (approximately 10% of jail population) and by inmate request, and those with positive test results are referred to jail HIV clinic. Candidates coming through the MAP or HIV clinics who agree to be approached will be contacted by a research assistant (RA). The RA will explain the study to interested individuals, will obtain additional contact information (additional phone numbers, address or location in community where patient could be found) and permission to contact the individual after release. Clinic staff will also routinely request this information from interested individuals in case they are released prior to RA visit in jail. Once released, the research team will contact the individual releasee to schedule an enrollment visit. At this visit, which will occur as soon as possible after jail release (maximum within 30 days of release), the research team will obtain informed consent and enroll the participant into the study. The enrollment may occur at the UT Southwestern HIV research unit (located above the main HIV clinic) or in the community as per participant preference. AIM 2: Conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial comparing the collaborative intervention (n=40) compared to treatment as usual (n=40) in HIV+ substance users released from jail. Enrollment: In order to be enrolled, individuals must (a) be ≥18 years old, (b) have a confirmed diagnosis of HIV, (c) have evidence of uncontrolled HIV (viral load >200 copies/mL within 90 days of enrollment, self‐reported non‐adherence to HIV medications or no community clinic visit in the 6 months preceding incarceration), (d) report or have medical records documenting any opioid (illicit or prescription misuse), stimulant (cocaine, ecstasy, or amphetamines), or heavy alcohol use (as determined by the 3‐item Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUD T‐C) within the past 12 months, and (e) provide at least 2 forms of contact information. They will also be asked to provide a release of information for their medical records at the jail and community clinics/ hospitals. No randomization will occur in Aim 1 as all 5 participants in the pilot testing phase will be assigned to the intervention. Baseline assessments will occur after informed consent is obtained and enrollment is complete. These assessments will focus on variables in the conceptual model, with collection of demographics (age, race/ethnicity, gender, HIV risk factor) and social variables (marital status, housing, education, employment/income, insurance, benefits, social support). Subjects will also be asked about HIV care (engagement in care, antiretroviral therapy, adherence to medications (using visual analog scale), barriers to care), mental illness, and substance use (using ASSIST questionnaire). Intervention: The first meeting with the CHW will occur at the time of enrollment if possible, depending on availability of the participant and CHW, otherwise it may occur anytime within 14 days of enrollment. After release from jail, the CHW will help the participant navigate to DOORS, where they will meet with a ""broker"", someone who helps the client/participant arrange and negotiate referrals to services within the extensive partner/provider network. The first broker meeting will typically occur within 2‐4 weeks after release, as this is a critical window for re‐engagement in care, underscored by the fact that this is also a high‐risk period for increased unprotected sex and return to substance use. Per DOORS' standard practice, the broker will complete a comprehensive needs assessment with the participant. Based on these assessments, together with the participant, the broker will develop a personalized re‐entry plan with a detailed list of referrals and calendar of scheduled visits with relevant agencies within the DOORS network. Study Assessments. All participants will complete baseline assessments prior to randomization and will have follow‐up visits at 3, 6 and 12 months as noted in Aim 1.3. A blood draw will be performed for 6‐month HIV viral load. Follow‐up visits will assess HIV viral load (abstracted from medical record for all visits other than 6 month), substance use (using ASSIST), healthcare utilization including attendance of HIV clinic visits, emergency room visits, hospitalizations and reincarceration. If individuals are reincarcerated at the Dallas County Jail at the time of the follow‐up visits, an attempt will be made to complete study visits at the jail. Follow‐up visits and assessments: Research visits will be scheduled at 3 months, 6 months and 12 months. A 4‐week window before and 8‐week window after the target follow‐up dates will be permitted for study assessments. Assessments will be completed at each follow‐up visit, including substance use, adherence, healthcare utilization and recidivism, with blood draw for HIV viral load collected at the 6‐month visit. In order to maximize efficient utilization of resources, for baseline and other follow‐up visits, HIV viral load will be abstracted from medical records. In order to have sufficient time to enroll and complete 12 month study visits for the 80 participants in Aim 2, the 5 pilot participants from Aim 1.3 need to reach at least the 3 month time point but not 6 or 12‐month visits before beginning study enrollment for Aim 2. Pilot participants will complete through 12‐month visits as this will provide insight as to how best to conduct these later follow‐up visits. All participants will receive financial reimbursement for study visits ($25 for each visit), unless they are incarcerated at the time of the visit. Jail inmates are not permitted to receive any financial incentives during incarceration. Introduction. In this aim, we will test the CHW‐DOORS intervention that was refined in Aim 1 in a randomized fashion. The goal of this aim is to establish feasibility of a randomized controlled trial in th s setting, to determine preliminary efficacy of the intervention and to inform sample size calculations for a fully powered trial. In addition, this aim will provide data regarding key factors involved in HIV+ substance users accessing substance use treatment and HIV care after jail release. Our working hypothesis is that from the stakeholder input and pilot testing completed in Aim 1, we will be able to successfully conduct a pilot randomized controlled trial and gain valuable insight into key predisposing and enabling factors influencing healthcare needs and utilization in this population, and how these may impact HIV viral load, substance use and recidivism. Research Design. Potential participants will be referred to the research study by Dallas County jail medical providers as described in Aim 1.3. Candidates who agree to be approached will be contacted by a RA who will recruit, and review eligibility criteria (see Aim 1.3). After release, potential participants will be contacted in order to complete informed consent, study enrollment and randomization (to be completed within 30 days of release from jail). All participants will provide 2 specific forms of locator information (telephone number for themselves, friend/family member, address, email, specific location where they may be located to aid in retention efforts). Participants will complete baseline assessments and will then be randomized to the intervention CHW‐DOORS versus treatment as usual (TAU). Randomization will occur by random assignment using a computer program, without block randomization given the small sample size. TAU participants will receive standard of care, which involves passive referral by jail medical staff to the outpatient HIV clinic. Intervention. Participants randomized to the intervention arm will meet with the CHW and a staff member from DOORS as outlined in Aim 1.3. Any modifications to this protocol after pilot testing in Aim 1.3 will be implemented in Aim 2. The general premise will be the same, where the DOORS broker will complete a needs assessment, generate an individualized re‐entry plan and make referrals to providers in the extensive DOORS network. The CHW will assist the participant in navigating these referrals, specifically with regards to HIV care, substance use treatment and mental healthcare. The measurement of the intervention will be as noted in Aim 1.3, with the DOORS broker following routine agency processes for referrals and measurement using the PIECES technology program and the CHW will record specifics (where, when, duration) of each visit and what was addressed during these intervention visits."
"7750","1","The NMDA antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT agonist psilocybin produce dissociable effects on structural encoding of emotional face expressions.^\nRATIONALE: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases."
"6251","0","Night-time Dexmedetomidine-esketamine Infusion and Sleep Quality With Mechanical Ventilation.^\nSleep disturbances are common in patients with mechanical ventilation during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with negative outcomes, including increased sensitivity to pain, increased risk of delirium and cardiovascular events, and delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine are both suggested for sedation and analgesia in ICU patients. Previous studies showed that night‐time dexmedetomidine infusion may improve sleep quality in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation, the effect is dose‐dependent. However, sedative dose dexmedetomidine increases adverse events inculding bradycardia and hypotension. Recent studies suggest that ketamine/esketamine may also improve sleep quality. But even low‐dose ketamine/esketamine increases adverse events including psychiatric and dissociative symptoms. We suppose that combined use of low‐dose dexmedetomidine and esketamine may produce synergic effects in improving sleep quality in ICU patients with less adverse events. The purpose of this trial is to observe whether night‐time infusion of low‐dose dexmedetomidine‐esketamine combination can improve sleep structure of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation and the safety of this regimen."

"5898","1","Therapeutic Alliance and Rapport Modulate Responses to Psilocybin Assisted Therapy for Depression.^\nBackground: Across psychotherapeutic frameworks, the strength of the therapeutic alliance has been found to correlate with treatment outcomes; however, its role has never been formally assessed in a trial of psychedelic-assisted therapy. We aimed to investigate the relationships between therapeutic alliance and rapport, the quality of the acute psychedelic experience and treatment outcomes. Methods: This 2-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial compared escitalopram with psychedelic-assisted therapy for moderate-severe depressive disorder (N = 59). This analysis focused on the psilocybin condition (n = 30), who received two oral doses of 25 mg psilocybin, 3-weeks apart, with psychological preparation, in-session support, and integration therapy. A new psychedelic therapy model, called ""Accept-Connect-Embody"" (ACE), was developed in this trial. The primary outcome was depression severity 6 weeks post treatment (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, QIDS-SR-16). Path analyses tested the hypothesis that therapeutic alliance (Scale To Assess the Therapeutic Relationship Patient Version, STAR-P) would predict depression outcomes via its influence on the acute psychedelic experience, specifically emotional-breakthrough (EBI) and mystical-type experiences (MEQ). The same analysis was performed on the escitalopram arm to test specificity. Results: The strength of therapeutic alliance predicted pre-session rapport, greater emotional-breakthrough and mystical-type experience (maximum EBI and MEQ scores across the two psilocybin sessions) and final QIDS scores (β = -0.22, R (2) = 0.42 for EBI(Max); β = -0.19, R (2) = 0.32 for MEQ(Max)). Exploratory path models revealed that final depression outcomes were more strongly affected by emotional breakthrough during the first, and mystical experience during the second session. Emotional breakthrough, but not mystical experience, during the first session had a positive effect on therapeutic alliance ahead of the second session (β = 0.79, p < 0.0001). Therapeutic alliance ahead of the second session had a direct impact on final depression scores, not mediated by the acute experience, with a weaker alliance ahead of the second psilocybin session predicting higher absolute depression scores at endpoint (β = -0.49, p < 0.001) Discussion: Future research could consider therapist training and characteristics; specific participant factors, e.g., attachment style or interpersonal trauma, which may underlie the quality of the therapeutic relationship, the psychedelic experience and clinical outcomes; and consider how therapeutic approaches might adapt in cases of weaker therapeutic alliance. Clinical Trial Registration: This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov, identifier (NCT03429075)."
"7751","1","Acute Effects of Methylphenidate, Modafinil, and MDMA on Negative Emotion Processing.^\nBACKGROUND: Stimulants such as methylphenidate and modafinil are frequently used as cognitive enhancers in healthy people, whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) is proposed to enhance mood and empathy in healthy subjects. However, comparative data on the effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on negative emotions in healthy subjects have been partially missing. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on the neural correlates of fearful face processing using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a positive control. METHODS: Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 60 mg methylphenidate, 600 mg modafinil, and 125 mg 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 22 healthy subjects while performing an event-related fMRI task to assess brain activation in response to fearful faces. Negative mood states were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and subjective ratings. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, modafinil, but not methylphenidate or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increased brain activation within a limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit during fearful face processing. Modafinil but not methylphenidate also increased amygdala responses to fearful faces compared with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus in response to fearful faces correlated positively with subjective feelings of fearfulness and depressiveness after modafinil administration. CONCLUSIONS: Despite the cognitive enhancement effects of 600 mg modafinil in healthy people, potential adverse effects on emotion processing should be considered."
"4291","1","From egoism to ecoism: Psychedelics increase nature relatedness in a state-mediated and context- dependent manner.^\n(1) Background: There appears to be a growing disconnection between humans and their natural environments which has been linked to poor mental health and ecological destruction. Previous research suggests that individual levels of nature relatedness can be increased through the use of classical psychedelic compounds, although a causal link between psychedelic use and nature relatedness has not yet been established. (2) Methods: Using correlations and generalized linear mixed regression modelling, we investigated the association between psychedelic use and nature relatedness in a prospective online study. Individuals planning to use a psychedelic received questionnaires 2 weeks before (N = 654), plus one day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 years after a psychedelic experience. (3) Results: The frequency of lifetime psychedelic use was positively correlated with nature relatedness at baseline. Nature relatedness was significantly increased 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 2 years after the psychedelic experience. This increase was positively correlated with concomitant increases in psychological well-being and was dependent on the extent of ego-dissolution and the perceived influence of natural surroundings during the acute psychedelic state. (4) Conclusions: The here presented evidence for a context- and state-dependent causal effect of psychedelic use on nature relatedness bears relevance for psychedelic treatment models in mental health and, in the face of the current ecological crisis, planetary health."
"483","0","Chronic stress pathology and ketamine-induced alterations in functional connectivity in major depressive disorder: An abridged review of the clinical evidence.^\nA paradigm shift in the conceptualization of the neurobiology of depression and the serendipitous discovery of ketamine's rapid-acting antidepressant (RAAD) effects has ushered in a new era of innovative research and novel drug development. Since the initial discovery of ketamine's RAAD effects, multiple studies have supported its short-term efficacy for fast-tracked improvements in treatment-resistant depression. Evidence from MRI studies have repeatedly demonstrated functional connectivity alterations in stress- and trauma-related disorders suggesting this may be a viable biomarker of chronic stress pathology (CSP). Human mechanistic studies further support this by coupling functional connectivity to ketamine's RAAD effects including connectivity to glutamate neurotransmission, ketamine to normalized connectivity, and these advantageous normalizations to symptom improvement/ketamine response. This review provides an abridged discussion of the suspected neurobiological underpinnings of ketamine's RAAD effects, highlighting ketamine-induced alterations in prefrontal, striatal, and anterior cingulate cortex functional connectivity in major depressive disorder. We present a model of CSP underscoring the role of synaptic loss and dysconnectivity and discuss how ketamine may be used both as (1) a treatment to restore and normalize these stress-induced neural alterations and (2) a tool to study potential biomarkers of CSP and treatment response. We conclude by noting challenges and future directions including heterogeneity, sex differences, the role of early life stress, and the need for proliferation of new methods, paradigms, and tools that will optimize signal and allow analyses at different levels of complexity, according to the needs of the question at hand, perhaps by thinking hierarchically about both clinical and biological phenotypes."
"6033","0","Ketamine Anesthesia in Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nThere are several drugs available to induce anesthesia for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), a psychiatric treatment for major depressive illness. The most commonly utilized of these include methohexital, thiopental, etomidate, and propofol. Recently, there has been interest in the use of ketamine in sub‐anesthetic doses to treat major depressive illness. In this randomized, blinded trial, depressed subjects scheduled to be treated with ECT were anesthetized with either ketamine or methohexital at doses of approximately 1.0 mg/kg for each drug. Patients received the same drug for up to six of their ECT treatments. Outcome measures included assessments of depressive severity, cognition, post‐anesthesia side effects, and hemodynamics. Subjects were to be followed with as long as they were receiving inpatient ECT treatments. The number of treatments was determined entirely by their primary psychiatric team, also blind to anesthetic, as per usual care. In other words, this study did not determine when to terminate the ECT course."

"7185","1","Effects of acute 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine on sleep and daytime sleepiness in MDMA users: a preliminary study.^\nSTUDY OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) affects monoamine neurotransmitters that play a critical role in sleep and daytime alertness. However, the acute effects of MDMA on sleep and daytime sleepiness have not been studied under placebo-controlled conditions. This study was designed to establish the effects of acute MDMA or placebo administration and sleep restriction on sleep and daytime sleepiness. DESIGN: Participants with a history of MDMA use were studied on 3 sessions of 3 nights (baseline, treatment, and recovery) and 2 days (following night 2 and 3) per session. On treatment nights (night 2), participants received placebo or 2 mg/kg of MDMA or underwent a restricted bed schedule with placebo. Sleep restriction was a positive control to compare sleep loss and consequent sleepiness associated with MDMA use. The scheduled sleep period was 8 hours long on nonrestricted nights, and standard sleep recordings and daytime sleepiness tests were conducted. Age-matched controls received 1 night and day of standard sleep and daytime sleepiness testing. SETTING: Sleep laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: Seven recreational MDMA-users and 13 matched control subjects. MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Acute MDMA shortened sleep primarily by increasing sleep latency, and it reduced stage 3/4 sleep and suppressed rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. The MDMA-reduced sleep time was not associated with increased daytime sleepiness the following day, as was seen in the sleep-restriction condition. Compared with control subjects, the MDMA users on the first night in the laboratory had shorter total sleep times and less stage 3/4 sleep. Average daily sleep latency on daytime sleepiness tests the day after nighttime placebo administration was increased in MDMA users compared with the control subjects, and MDMA users had an elevated number of sleep-onset REM periods on these tests, compared with control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: Acute MDMA administration disrupts sleep and REM sleep, specifically, without producing daytime sleepiness such as sleep restriction does. Compared with control subjects, recreational MDMA users showed evidence of hyperarousal and impaired REM function. The mechanism behind these effects is likely due to the deleterious effects of MDMA on catecholamines."
"2938","1","Opioid-sparing effect of preemptive bolus low-dose ketamine for moderate sedation in opioid abusers undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy: a randomized clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been used as part of a multimodal analgesia regime in opioid abusers undergoing general anesthesia. We studied the opioid-sparing effect of a very low-dose bolus of ketamine as part of moderate sedation for opioid abuse patients undergoing extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy. METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 190 opioid abusers were enrolled. They were stratified into 2 blocks based on their daily opioid consumption. Both blocks were then randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg IV ketamine (group K) or placebo (group P). Lithotripsy was performed under moderate sedation with intermittent bolus doses of remifentanil (0.2 µg/kg) to alleviate pain. The total remifentanil dose (primary outcome) and respiratory adverse events (secondary outcome) were compared in the 2 groups. RESULTS: Remifentanil administration in the group with low-opioid consumers was 1.6 ± 0.4 µg/kg (group P) compared with 1.0 ± 0.2 µg/kg in group K (confidence interval [CI](of difference) 95%, 0.4-0.7; P < 0.001). Patients who had high-opioid consumption received 2.0 ± 0.5 µg/kg (group P) vs 1.5 ± 0.3 µg/kg (group K) remifentanil (CI(of difference) 95%, 0.40-0.75; P < 0.001). Ready to discharge time was statistically longer in high-consumption opioid abusers who received placebo compared with group K (55 ± 13 minutes vs 44 ± 8 minutes, CI(of difference) 95%, 6-15; P < 0.001). The incidences of bradypnea, apnea, nausea, vomiting, and hemodynamic changes were not statistically different between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSION: Preemptive low-dose ketamine (0.1 mg/kg) as a bolus has opioid-sparing effects in opioid abusers undergoing moderate sedation."
"2200","0","Strenuous exercise aggravates MDMA-induced skeletal muscle damage in mice.^\nThe aim of this study was to investigate the influence of ecstasy (MDMA) administration on body temperature and soleus muscle histology in exercised and non-exercised mice. Charles-River mice were distributed into four groups: Control (C), exercise (EX), MDMA treated (M), and M + EX. The treated animals received an i.p. injection (10 mg/kg) of MDMA (saline for C and EX), and the exercise consisted of a 90 min level run at a velocity of 900 m/h, immediately after the MDMA or saline administration. Body temperature was recorded every 30 min via subcutaneous implanted transponder. Animals were sacrificed 1.5, 25.5, and 49.5 h after i.p. injection and the soleus muscles were removed and processed for light and electron microscopy. The MDMA-treated animals showed a significant increase in body temperature (similar in M and M + EX groups), reaching the peak 90 min after i.p. administration; their temperature remained higher than control for more than 5 h. The EX group evidenced a similar and parallel, yet lower temperature increase during exercise and recovery. Morphological signs of damage were rarely encountered in the EX group; they were more pronounced in M group and even aggravated in M + EX group. In conclusion, MDMA and exercise per se increased body temperature but in conjunction did not have a cumulated effect. However, ecstasy and concomitant physical activity might severely accumulate with regard to skeletal muscle toxicity and may lead to rhabdomyolysis. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"1917","1","Non-linear pharmacokinetics of MDMA ('ecstasy') in humans.^\nAIMS: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, commonly called ecstasy) is a synthetic compound increasingly popular as a recreational drug. Little is known about its pharmacology, including its metabolism and pharmacokinetics, in humans in controlled settings. A clinical trial was designed for the evaluation of MDMA pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics in healthy volunteers. METHODS: A total of 14 subjects were included. In the pilot phase six received MDMA at 50 (n=2), 100 (n=2), and 150 mg (n=2). In the second phase eight received MDMA at both 75 and 125 mg (n=8). Subjects were phenotyped for CYP2D6 activity and were classified as extensive metabolizers for substrates, such as MDMA, whose hepatic metabolism is regulated by this enzyme. Plasma and urine samples were collected throughout the study for the evaluation of MDMA pharmacokinetics. Body fluids were analysed for the determination of MDMA and its main metabolites 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-methamphetamine (HMMA) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-amphetamine (HMA). RESULTS: As the dose of MDMA administered was increased, volunteers showed rises in MDMA concentrations that did not follow the same proportionality which could be indicative of nonlinearity. In the full range of doses tested the constant recovery of HMMA in the urine combined with the increasing MDMA recovery seems to point towards a saturation or an inhibition of MDMA metabolism (the demethylenation step). These observations are further supported by the fact that urinary clearance was rather constant while nonrenal clearance was dose dependent. CONCLUSIONS: It has previously been postulated that individuals genetically deficient for the hepatic enzyme CYP2D6 (about 10% of the Caucasian people) were at risk of developing acute toxicity at moderate doses of MDMA because the drug would accumulate in the body instead of being metabolized and inactivated. The lack of linearity of MDMA pharmacokinetics (in a window of doses compatible with its recreational use) is a more general phenomenon as it concerns the whole population independent of their CYP2D6 genotype. It implies that relatively small increases in the dose of MDMA ingested are translated to disproportionate rises in MDMA plasma concentrations and hence subjects are more prone to develop acute toxicity."

Here, we assess the prevalence of profound, meaningful, and mystical experiences in experienced meditators during a month-long insight meditation retreat compared to a control group of similarly experienced meditators. Method Participants completed the 100-item States of Consciousness Questionnaire (SOCQ) and the Mysticism Scale before and after a 3-week period of intensive retreat or daily life. Multivariate distance matrix regression was used to compare multivariate profiles of responses on the SOCQ and to describe which items contributed most to differences between groups at the end of retreat. Changes in self-reported mystical dimensions of experience were also directly compared between retreat and control participants. Results The retreat and control groups differed over the training period in their multivariate profile of individual experiences. Retreat group participants reported a greater extent of profound insights, powerful emotional experiences, and non-ordinary sensory or perceptual events compared to experienced meditators not on retreat. Retreatants also reported greater levels of specific dimensions of mystical experience, including internal unity, transcendence, sacredness, noetic quality, and deeply felt positive affect, relative to control participants. Conclusions These findings support the idea that intensive periods of meditation training are associated with a range of profound and mystical-type experiences. Increased access to these experiences may be one path by which immersive periods of contemplative training contribute to psychological or spiritual development, though the long-term consequences of such experiences remain to be fully understood."
"5869","1","Neuroimaging of chronic MDMA (""ecstasy"") effects: A meta-analysis.^\nIn this meta-analysis, we aimed to assess the evidence from neuroimaging studies for chronic alterations in the brains of MDMA users. The databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published from inception to August 24, 2018, without any language restriction. Sixteen independent studies comprising 356 MDMA users and 311 controls were included. Of these, five studies investigated frontal and occipital N-acetylaspartate/creatine and myo-inositol/creatine ratios, three studies assessed basal ganglia blood flow and ten studies investigated serotonin transporter (SERT) density in various regions. We found significantly decreased SERT density in eight of 13 investigated regions. Meta-regression indicated a positive association with abstinence, but none with lifetime episodes of use. Therefore, other variables (such as doses taken per occasion) might be more important determinants. Positive associations between time of abstinence and SERT density might indicate that these alterations are reversible to some extent. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between user and control groups in terms of neurochemical ratios in the frontal and occipital lobes and blood flow in the basal ganglia. Overall, MDMA user groups showed heavy use patterns and study quality was poor."
"7226","1","Does ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) induce subjective feelings of social connection in humans? A multilevel meta-analysis.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a psychostimulant known for producing positive subjective effects and for enhancing social functioning and social connection in both clinical and recreational settings. Over the past two decades, scientists have begun to study the psychological effects of MDMA through rigorous placebo-controlled experimental work. However, most existing studies have small Ns, and the average sizes of the reported effects are unknown, creating uncertainty about the impact of these findings. The goal of the present study was to quantify the strength of MDMA's effects on self-reported social connection by aggregating sociability-related outcomes across multiple placebo-controlled studies. To this end, we conducted a multilevel meta-analysis based on 27 studies, 54 effect sizes, and a total of 592 participants. The results revealed a moderate-to-large effect (d = 0.86; 95% CI [0.68, 1.04]; r = .39; 95% CI [.32, .46]) of MDMA on self-reported sociability-related outcomes (e.g., feeling loving, talkative, and friendly). Given the magnitude of its effect on felt sociability, we propose that MDMA may have powerful implications for a variety of social contexts and for clinical settings, in particular. Finally, we discuss potential mechanisms underlying the relationship between MDMA and sociability-related feelings, as well as future directions for experimental work in this area."
"8223","1","Application of the multiple drugs immunoassay test for rapid detection of drug abuse in postmortem urine.^\nObjective: The ADVANCED QUALITY™ One Step Multi-Drug Screen test is a new urine on-site immunoassay test that is designed to detect multiple drugs of abuse in one time (barbiturates, benzodiazepines, cocaine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), methamphetamine, and opiates group). Thus, the present research was done to evaluate the diagnostic performance of this test. Material and Method: Urine samples obtained from corpses subjected to medicolegal autopsy at the forensic unit in Ramathibodi Hospital between October 2007 and March 2009 were used for the present study. The diagnostic performance of this immunoassay test was determined by using the results of the rapid emergency drug identification high sensitivity (REMEDi™ HS) system as the gold standard. Results: Two hundred forty six urine samples were used in the present study. The sensitivity with their 95% confidence interval of cocaine, opiates, methamphetamine, and benzodiazepines assay was 100% (100-100%) each. The specificity with their 95% confidence interval of these was 100% (100-100%), 98% (96.75-99.94%), 95% (91.70-97.38%), and 93% (89.89-96.24%), respectively. The MDMA and barbiturates were not evaluated because there was no true positive result. Conclusion: The ADVANCED QUALITY™ One Step Multi-Drug Screen test is reliable for drugs of abuse screening in postmortem urine."

These children were classified as ASA PS 1 or 2, and were referred to the Dental Sedation Study Center (NESO) of the Federal University of Goiás School of Dentistry by public health services. After the child was considered eligible to participate in the survey and your legal guardian have agreed with their participation, the same was assigned at random to a group. The randomization plan of children in groups was prepared through the website Randomization.com (http://www.randomization.com). The data were analyzed using the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS for Windows, version 19.0 SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL, USA), having the following variables: a) dependents (occurrence of adverse events in 24 hours following procedure; occurrence of intraoperative adverse events; child's Behavior) and b) independents (gender; age; weight; dose of oral sedatives; need for physical restraint; duration of the session; recovery time; heart rate; oxygen saturation). According to the distribution of the data obtained for the analysis Mann‐Whitney test, Pearson's Chi‐square and Fisher test were used. The choice of these non‐parametric tests were due to the characteristics of the data of the study, which did not present normal distribution. Adopted as significance level for the statistical tests applied a value of 5% (p < 0.05). In this clinical trial, randomized controlled type triple‐blind, two groups of children received specific interventions: a) MC group: composed of children undergoing sedation for association of midazolam and ketamine per oral, and placebo (oxygen) by inhalation; b) MCS: group composed of children undergoing sedation for association of midazolam and ketamine per oral, and inhaled sevoflurane. Inclusion criteria were: 1) age of four to six years (until the end of the dental procedures); 2) children ASA I or II; 3) need for restorative procedure at least a deciduous tooth; 4) patent airway and nasal effective breathing and 5) inadequate behavior in previous dental treatment. Exclusion criteria were 1) previous experience of dental treatment under sedation or 2) having completed seven years during data collection. Sample size was calculated based on primary study with 18 children, which were included in the final sample. In this, through two‐tailed hypothesis test, it was found that the occurrence of adverse events in the first 24 hours after sedation for dental treatment presented proportion of 87.5% for the MC Group and proportion of 30% for the MCS Group, which if defined that, to achieve the probability of 80% of the study to detect a difference in a level of significance of 5%, we would need a sample of 10 participants for each group (n = 20). On the day of treatment, upon arriving at the clinic, after checking healthiness of children and NPO protocols, the child accompanied by their parent/guardian were redirected to a drug delivery room, where the anesthesiologist or the pediatrician prepared medications in a disposable syringe and administered the drugs: midazolam‐Dormire ® (Cristália, São Paulo, Brazil), at a dose of 0.5 mg/kg (maximum dose 20 mg) and ketamine‐Ketamin ® (Cristália, São Paulo, Brazil), at a dose of 3 mg/kg (maximum 50 mg). After 15 minutes, they were redirected to the dental office and vital signs were monitored (Infinity ® Vista XL (Drägerwerk AG & co., Lubeck, Germany). According to the randomization, the child received only oxygen or a mixture of oxygen and sevoflurane‐Sevocris ® (Cristália, São Paulo, Brazil), provided through an anesthesia workstation (Fabius ® Plus ‐ Drägerwerk AG & co., Lubeck, Germany). Such gases were provided through a mask placed over the nose of the child (Dynomite ® Nasal Hood ‐ Matrx‐Parker Instrument, Hatfield, U A) and analysed using an anesthetic gas analyser (Let's ® ‐Drägerwerk AG & co., Lubeck, Germany). Initially, the child received the 100% oxygen at a flow rate of 5 l/min, for 5 minutes. After this period, if the child had been randomized to the MCS Group, sevoflurane was added in an initial concentration of 0.1%, with 0.1% increment every 30 seconds, until a final expired concentration between 0.3 and 0.4 %. In cases where the child had been randomized to the MC Group (without sevoflurane), the anesthesiologist simulating the supply of sevoflurane, but the child received only 100% oxygen. After 15 minutes of placing the nasal mask and supply of gases, the pediatric dentist dental treatment began as planned. At the end of each procedure, post‐operative recommendations (written protocol) were given to parents/guardians. On the day following treatment, telephone contact was made to parents/guardians to gather information about possible adverse events in 24 hours following procedure. In both groups, during the sessions, children's behavior was evaluated through the Houpt scale, with an observer previously calibrated and masked. The scoring system suggested by Houpt et al. for this purpose included four scales: sleep scale (awake ‐ score 1; asleep ‐ score 2), crying scale (hysterical crying that demands attention ‐ score 1; continuous, persistant crying that makes treatment difficult ‐ score 2; intermittent, mild crying that does not interfere with the treatment ‐ score 3; no crying ‐ score 4), movement scale (violent movement, interrupting treatment ‐ score 1; continuous movement make treatment difficult ‐ score 2; controllable movement that does not interferes with the treatment ‐ score 3; no movement ‐ score 4) and overall behavior scale (aborted, no treatment rendered ‐ score 1; poor, treatment interrupted, only partial treatment completed ‐ score 2; fair, treatment interrupted, but eventually all completed ‐ score 3; good, difficult but all treatment performed ‐ score 4; very good, some limited crying or movement ‐ score 5; excellent, no crying or movement ‐ score 6). The evaluations were performed during all the treatment sessions. The scores were established in accordance with the Houpt Scale every minute of the session, and in three specific moments of the dental treatment (at the time of anesthesia, at the time of use of high rotation and at the end of treatment), in addition to the overall evaluation. For calibration, the examiner watched five minutes videos of three patients during the clinical examination. The same videos were watched by a researcher as a gold standard, in order to assess the correlation between the examiners. There was concurrence intra and inter examiner, obtaining values of kappa 0.9 and 0.8, respectively."

This initial paper describes in detail the methodology of the entire study which involves six 60 day drug periods for each subject completing the protocol - one period on each of the 5 drugs and one period on placebo, in a balanced design. Measures of laboratory sleep, home sleep and mood were obtained throughout the study. Comparisons between the long placebo only period of this study and the more usual 'baseline' period, laboratory nights 4 to 6, revealed a significantly higher total desynchronized sleep time (D time) and D time per cent in the placebo period. Other variables were not significantly different. Some clear changes over time within the long placebo period are also described."
"8869","1","Safety pharmacology of acute MDMA administration in healthy subjects.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is being investigated in MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. The present study characterized the safety pharmacology of single-dose administrations of MDMA (75 or 125 mg) using data from nine double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover studies performed in the same laboratory in a total of 166 healthy subjects. The duration of the subjective effects was 4.2 ± 1.3 h (range: 1.4-8.2 h). The 125 mg dose of MDMA produced greater 'good drug effect' ratings than 75 mg. MDMA produced moderate and transient 'bad drug effect' ratings, which were greater in women than in men. MDMA increased systolic blood pressure to >160 mmHg, heart rate >100 beats/min, and body temperature >38°C in 33%, 29% and 19% of the subjects, respectively. These proportions of subjects with hypertension (>160 mmHg), tachycardia, and body temperature >38°C were all significantly greater after 125 mg MDMA compared with the 75 mg dose. Acute and subacute adverse effects of MDMA as assessed by the List of Complaints were dose-dependent and more frequent in females. MDMA did not affect liver or kidney function at EOS 29 ± 22 days after use. No serious adverse events occurred. In conclusion, MDMA produced predominantly acute positive subjective drug effects. Bad subjective drug effects and other adverse effects were significantly more common in women. MDMA administration was overall safe in physically and psychiatrically healthy subjects and in a medical setting. However, the risks of MDMA are likely higher in patients with cardiovascular disease and remain to be investigated in patients with psychiatric disorders."
"7113","1","Pediatric premedication: a double-blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients. When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication, children tend to awaken when separated from their parents, and body movements occur during invasive procedures. We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3 mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6 mg/kg (group K) 30 min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P = 0.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P = 0.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P = 0.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P = 0.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg and oral ketamine 3 mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

"643","1","Serotonin 2A Receptor Signaling Underlies LSD-induced Alteration of the Neural Response to Dynamic Changes in Music.^\nClassic psychedelic drugs (serotonin 2A, or 5HT2A, receptor agonists) have notable effects on music listening. In the current report, blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signal was collected during music listening in 25 healthy adults after administration of placebo, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and LSD pretreated with the 5HT2A antagonist ketanserin, to investigate the role of 5HT2A receptor signaling in the neural response to the time-varying tonal structure of music. Tonality-tracking analysis of BOLD data revealed that 5HT2A receptor signaling alters the neural response to music in brain regions supporting basic and higher-level musical and auditory processing, and areas involved in memory, emotion, and self-referential processing. This suggests a critical role of 5HT2A receptor signaling in supporting the neural tracking of dynamic tonal structure in music, as well as in supporting the associated increases in emotionality, connectedness, and meaningfulness in response to music that are commonly observed after the administration of LSD and other psychedelics. Together, these findings inform the neuropsychopharmacology of music perception and cognition, meaningful music listening experiences, and altered perception of music during psychedelic experiences."
"7593","1","Disentangling the association of depression on the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Fatigue and depression are closely associated. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to understand the relationships between depression and improvements in specific depression domains on the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine, which we previously reported. METHODS: This secondary analysis re-evaluated data collected longitudinally from 39 patients with treatment-resistant Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) enrolled in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial using a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or placebo. A mediation model assessed the effect of depression on the anti-fatigue effects of a single dose of intravenous ketamine versus placebo at Day 1 post-infusion. Fatigue was measured using the National Institutes of Health-Brief Fatigue Inventory (NIH-BFI), and depression was assessed by the Montgomery-Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Compared to placebo, ketamine significantly improved fatigue (p = .0003) as measured by the NIH-BFI, but the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine disappeared (p = .47) when controlling for depression as measured by MADRS total score. In this study sample, the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine were mostly accounted for by the changes in amotivation and depressed mood scores. CONCLUSIONS: In this study, ketamine did not have a unique effect on fatigue outside of its general antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Specifically, the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine observed in this study seem to be explained by the effects of ketamine on two symptom domains of depression: amotivation and depressed mood. The study findings suggest that the anti-fatigue effects of ketamine should be assessed by fatigue-specific measures other than the NIH-BFI or future studies should enroll fatigued patients without depression."

Thus, this study examined postoperative analgesic and adverse effects of local ketamine administered postoperatively. Methods: Ketamine (0.3%, 3 mL) or saline was subcutaneously infiltrated before incision in a double-blind manner using a sample population of 40 patients undergoing circumcision surgery, equally and randomly assigned to 2 groups based on the treatment. The saline-infiltrated patients also received 9-mg intramuscular ketamine into the upper arm to control for any related systemic analgesic effects. The patients were followed up for 24 hours to determine postoperative analgesia and identify adverse effects. Results: In the ketamine-infiltrated patients, the time interval until first analgesic demand (166 vs. 80 min) was longer and the incidence of pain-free status (pain score = 0) during movement (45% vs. 10%) and erection (40% vs. 0%) was significantly higher than for the saline-treated analogs (P < 0.05). The dose of ketorolac use and pain score during erection were significant lower in group ketamine patients. No significant differences were noted with respect to the incidence of adverse effects comparing the 2 groups. Discussion: We conclude that preincisional subcutaneous ketamine infiltration can suppress postoperative pain after the circumcision surgery.

METHODS: The present randomized, double-blinded controlled trial included 303 breast cancer patients with mild/moderate depression from June 2017 to June 2018. All patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) control group, patients treated with normal saline; (2) racemic ketamine group, patients treated with racemic ketamine; (3) S-ketamine group, patients treated with S-ketamine. Operation time, blood loss and hospital stay and complications were recorded. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was recorded, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were measured at three days, one week, one month and three months after surgery. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in operation time, bleeding volume and complication rate. In both groups, the VAS scores at one day and three days after surgery were significantly lower. The HAMD-17 scores were significantly lower, and the serum levels of both BDNF and 5-HT were remarkably higher at three days, one week and one month after surgery. Meanwhile, the HAMD-17 scores were remarkably lower, while the serum levels of BDNF and 5-HT were remarkably higher in the S-ketamine group. The BDNF and 5-HT levels were negatively correlated with the HAMD-17 score. CONCLUSION: S-ketamine is more effective for reducing POD for breast cancer patients."

The sample consisted of 98 current and former users of MDMA. Several strategies were utilized to recruit respondents and data were collected through in-depth interviews during 1997 and 1998. The majority of respondents had used MDMA during the 6-month period prior to the interview and a large percentage had consumed the drug on 100 occasions or more. Most respondents reported feelings of emotional closeness while consuming MDMA but without the desire for penetrative sex. Others, however, reported that MDMA increased sexual arousal and some respondents (in particular, gay and bisexual females) had used MDMA specifically for sexual enhancement. Sexual risk taking (e.g., having multiple partners, engaging in sex without a condom) was prevalent among respondents who did engage in sexual activity during MDMA episodes. Explanations for the findings are offered and implications for prevention/intervention are discussed. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc."

The article by Kishimoto et al., about meta-analysis of the antidepressant effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist ketamine (racemate) and non-ketamine NMDA-R antagonists (traxoprodil, lanicemine, rapastinel) in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder. The authors examined the time trajectory of efficacy of ketamine and non-ketamine NMDA-R antagonists. The greater reduction in depressive symptoms by ketamine infusion started as early as within 40–60 min, peaking on day 1, and lasting until days 5–8, with maintenance of superior remission and response status until days 3–5 and 7, respectively. Effect sizes of ketamine ranged from medium to high (−0.38 to −1.00). In contrast to ketamine, single infusion of non-ketamine NMDA-R antagonists was only significantly superior to placebo at one assessment time point (days 5–8) with a small to medium effect size (−0.37). Together, it is likely that non-ketamine NMDA-R antagonists have smaller effect sizes than ketamine, although the reason underlying this difference remains unclear.

"1772","0","Psychedelic drugs for psychiatric disorders.^\nExisting pharmacological treatments for psychiatric disorders have demonstrated limited efficacy, delayed onset of action, and significant burden of side effects. Recent findings from human studies with psychedelics have shown promise, demonstrating rapid and sustained clinical benefits of these compounds for a variety of psychiatric disorders. Classical psychedelics have a rich history and some of these compounds have been used in shamanic and spiritual ceremonies for millennia. The psychoactive effects of these drugs, particularly on human consciousness, have generated great scientific curiosity, and early research on psychedelics suggested their clinical benefits for psychiatric conditions, including alcohol use disorders and anxiety and depressive symptoms in terminal illness and life-threatening conditions. Since the 1990s, after a period of dormancy that followed the criminalization of psychedelic drugs since the Controlled Substance Act of 1970, the continued interest in their unique psychoactive effects along with the pursuit for novel and more effective treatments in psychiatry have led to a renewed interest in research on these compounds. While preliminary findings on psychedelics are encouraging, current evidence is still insufficient to support extensive use of these drugs routinely. Long-term safety and efficacy of these compounds remain unclear, and several clinical trials are underway and may add clarity to these questions. Therefore, this article intends to provide an overview of the evidence to date on psychedelic drugs - particularly psilocybin, MDMA, and LSD - for the treatment of psychiatric disorders."
"7614","0","Mirtazapine: only for depression?.^\nBACKGROUND: Mirtazapine is an antidepressant first approved in the Netherlands in 1994 for the treatment of major depressive disorder. However, evidence suggests its effectiveness in a variety of other psychiatric disorders and non-psychiatric medical conditions. OBJECTIVE: The present paper reviews the published literature on the off-label indications of Mirtazapine. METHODS: A search of the relevant literature from MEDLINE, PsycLIT and EMBASE databases, included in the Science Citation Index and available up to March 2006, was conducted using the terms mirtazapine, case-reports, open-label trials and randomized controlled trials. Only articles referring to conditions other than major depression were included in this present review. RESULTS: Off-label use of mirtazapine has been reported in panic disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, social phobia, obsessive-compulsive disorder, dysthymia, menopausal depression, poststroke depression, depression as a result of infection with human immunodeficiency virus, elderly depression, Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced depression, hot flashes, alcohol and other substance use disorders, sleep disorders, sexual disorders, tension-type headaches, cancer pain, fibromyalgia, schizophrenia and other less frequent conditions. CONCLUSIONS: So far, data on the off-label usefulness of mirtazapine are limited and mainly based on observations from case reports or open-label studies. However, positive cues suggest that confirmation of these preliminary data with randomized controlled trials may give sufficient evidence to warrant the use of mirtazapine in a broad range of disorders."
