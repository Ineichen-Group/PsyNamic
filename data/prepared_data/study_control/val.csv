"1631","Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2830","No difference in brain activation during cognitive performance between ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users and control subjects: A [H215O]-positron emission tomography study.^\nThe long-term use of the serotonin-releaser and uptake-inhibitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") has been associated with memory impairments and increased liability to depressive mood and anxiety attacks. It is unclear, however, whether these psychologic deviations are reflected in alterations of the underlying neurophysiologic substrate. The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-naïve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O]. Mood was assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the EWL Mood Rating Scale. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention. However, significantly higher levels of depressiveness as determined by the HAM-D and EWL scales were found in Ecstasy-using subjects. These data indicate that, despite differences in mood, polytoxic Ecstasy users do not differ from Ecstasy-naïve controls in terms of local brain activity. Heightened depressiveness in the Ecstasy group was consistent with results from previous studies and could be related to serotonergic hypofunction resulting from repeated MDMA consumption. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences are preexisting rather than a result of Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5032","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

"6449","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6563","The relation between naturalistic use of psychedelics and perception of emotional stimuli: An event-related potential study comparing non-users and experienced users of classic psychedelics.^\nBackground: Previous research has suggested that controlled administration of psychedelic substances can modulate emotional reactivity, enhancing positive and diminishing negative emotions. However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300). Conclusions: The results suggest that naturalistic use of psychedelics may be linked to reduced reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli at the early and automatic processing stages. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the effects related to using psychedelics in naturalistic contexts.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6591","Ketamine and midazolam for invasive procedures in children with malignancy: a comparison of routes of intravenous, oral, and rectal administration.^\nWe investigated the efficacy of a combination of ketamine and midazolam, comparing intravenous, oral, and rectal administrations for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. Seventy-three children under 5 years of age, who were scheduled for invasive procedure, were assigned to one of three groups: IV group (n = 25), ketamine 1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg were given intravenously; PO group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given orally; and PR group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg given rectally. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for side-effects. Optimal sedation (drowsy and asleep) was provided in 78 per cent of all patients and no statistical difference was observed among the three groups. No severe complications were observed in all groups. Recovery time from sedation was significantly longer in the intravenous group (>120 min in two patients). Hallucination was noted in three (12 per cent) patients given intravenous medication, but not in those given oral or rectal medications. It is concluded that intravenous, oral, and rectal midazolam/ketamine are equally effective for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. The use of intravenous ketamine/midazolam may produce prolonged sedation and psychedelic effects in children. These adverse effects may alter the child's comfort and parental satisfaction.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6909","Assessment of chronic exposure to MDMA in a group of consumers by segmental hair analysis.^\nThe suitability of segmental hair analysis of MDMA to monitor past chronic exposure to the drug was investigated in a follow-up study of ecstasy consumers. The purpose, among others, was to look for an objective biomarker of the history of drug consumption. Thirteen naturally colored hair samples were used to assess possible association between hair concentration of MDMA in 1-, 5-, and 9-cm segments and self-reported use in the last 1, 6, and 12 months. Agreement between the self-reported data given by the subjects on their ""ecstasy"" use in the previous month and MDMA hair concentration was good (r = 0.92) in all the examined subjects, with the exception of 2 individuals who declared a high consumption of the drug (12 tablets in the last month). When comparing the subjects' declaration of tablets consumed per month within the last 6 months, concordance with the hair MDMA values decreased and no correlation seemed to exist between the mean number of tablets consumed in the last 12 months and the concentration of MDMA in hair. However, when grouping subjects with a similar level of declared drug use (independently of whether in the previous month, last 6 months and last 12 months) and comparing the data with the mean MDMA concentrations found in the corresponding hair segments, an excellent level of agreement was found in groups of subjects consuming <5 tablets of MDMA per month (r = 0.93). Although the present findings were obtained from a small group of individuals and are intended as preliminary results, we can conclude that a cutoff of 0.5 ng MDMA per mg hair seems reasonable to assess drug consumption, unless the level of consumption was once per month in the last 12 months. Doubling the monthly consumption increases hair MDMA by around 1 ng/mg hair up to a level of 4 consumed tablets a month. It does not seem possible to draw definitive conclusions from higher concentrations in hair samples. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7750","The NMDA antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT agonist psilocybin produce dissociable effects on structural encoding of emotional face expressions.^\nRATIONALE: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8031","Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^\nBackground: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health. Future research should investigate the causal effects of classic psychedelics on physical health and evaluate possible mechanisms.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5679","Variation of drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations based on age and sex: an epidemiological approach based on European emergency departments.^\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the relative percentage of acute recreational drug toxicity emergency department (ED) presentations involving the main drug groups according to age and sex and investigate different patterns based on sex and age strata. METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males. CONCLUSION: Differences in the drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations according to age and sex may be relevant for developing drug-prevention and education programs for some particular subgroups of the population based on the increased risk of adverse events in specific sex and/or age strata.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7451","The effects of ketamine on the mismatch negativity (MMN) in humans—A meta-analysis.^\nObjective: To investigate whether effects of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine on the mismatch negativity (MMN) vary between duration and frequency deviants, as suggested by clinical studies on schizophrenia patients. Methods: Our meta-analysis included previous studies that used ketamine in order to induce psychotic experiences in healthy participants and that recorded the MMN either by electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography. Results: The analysis revealed systematic MMN amplitude decreases and, with a lower effect size, latency increases after ketamine administration. However, the observed amplitude and latency effects did not vary between duration and frequency deviants. Conclusion: Across studies, there is no evidence that ketamine effects on the MMN are larger for duration than frequency deviants. Significance: Our findings tentatively suggest that, in addition to an NMDA receptor hypofunction, other factors might contribute to the sometimes observed pattern of impaired MMN responses to duration deviants, but unimpaired MMN responses to frequency deviants in schizophrenia.

METHODS: Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or saline solutions under randomized, double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion (i.e., mean 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 +/- SD 10 points vs. 0 +/- 12 points, respectively during active and sham treatment). CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a potential role for NMDA receptor-modulating drugs in the treatment of depression.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1385","A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry, ACTRN12613000708752.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2483","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5705","D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5968","Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder: a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^\nBackground: ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed, global, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine (ESK) nasal spray vs placebo (PBO) nasal spray, given in the context of comprehensive standard of care (SoC; ie, hospitalization, initiation, or optimization of antidepressant therapy), in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation with intent. These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

"8889","Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2031","Evidence for chronically altered serotonin function in the cerebral cortex of female 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine polydrug users.^\nCONTEXT: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also popularly known as ""ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that produces loss of serotonin axons in animal models. Whether MDMA produces chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in humans remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MDMA use is associated with chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in the cerebral cortex of women as reflected by increased serotonin(2A) receptor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study comparing serotonin(2A) receptor levels in abstinent female MDMA polydrug users with those in women who did not use MDMA (within-group design assessing the association of lifetime MDMA use and serotonin(2A) receptors). Case participants were abstinent from MDMA use for at least 90 days as verified by analysis of hair samples. The serotonin(2A) receptor levels in the cerebral cortex were determined using serotonin(2A)-specific positron emission tomography with radioligand fluorine 18-labeled setoperone as the tracer. SETTING: Academic medical center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 female MDMA users and 10 women who did not use MDMA (controls). The main exclusion criteria were nondrug-related DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders and general medical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical serotonin(2A) receptor nondisplaceable binding potential (serotonin(2A)BP(ND)). RESULTS: MDMA users had increased serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in occipital-parietal (19.7%), temporal (20.5%), occipitotemporal-parietal (18.3%), frontal (16.6%), and frontoparietal (18.5%) regions (corrected P < .05). Lifetime MDMA use was positively associated with serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in frontoparietal (β = 0.665; P = .007), occipitotemporal (β = 0.798; P = .002), frontolimbic (β = 0.634; P = .02), and frontal (β = 0.691; P = .008) regions. In contrast, there were no regions in which MDMA use was inversely associated with receptor levels. There were no statistically significant effects of the duration of MDMA abstinence on serotonin(2A)BP(ND). CONCLUSIONS: The recreational use of MDMA is associated with long-lasting increases in serotonin(2A) receptor density. Serotonin(2A) receptor levels correlate positively with lifetime MDMA use and do not decrease with abstinence. These results suggest that MDMA use produces chronic serotonin neurotoxicity in humans. Given the broad role of serotonin in human brain function, the possibility for therapeutic MDMA use, and the widespread recreational popularity of this drug, these results have critical public health implications.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4530","Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) for alcoholism: meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.^\nAssessments of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of alcoholism have not been based on quantitative meta-analysis. Hence, we performed a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials in order to evaluate the clinical efficacy of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Two reviewers independently extracted the data, pooling the effects using odds ratios (ORs) by a generic inverse variance, random effects model. We identified six eligible trials, including 536 participants. There was evidence for a beneficial effect of LSD on alcohol misuse (OR, 1.96; 95% CI, 1.36-2.84; p = 0.0003). Between-trial heterogeneity for the treatment effects was negligible (I² = 0%). Secondary outcomes, risk of bias and limitations are discussed. A single dose of LSD, in the context of various alcoholism treatment programs, is associated with a decrease in alcohol misuse.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4634","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^\nObjective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4635","Inhibition of MDMA-induced increase in cortisol does not prevent acute impairment of verbal memory.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of ± 3,4 metylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to block the MDMA-induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo-controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pre-treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. RESULTS: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA-induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA-induced memory deficit from happening. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that MDMA-induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA-induced memory impairments.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4640","Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4682","Ketamine activates psychosis and alters limbic blood flow in schizophrenia.^\nThe non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine, given to schizophrenic individuals in subanesthetic doses, produced a short-lived, discrete activation of their psychotic symptoms, which had striking similarities to symptoms of their usual psychotic episodes. To further study this psychotomimetic property of ketamine, we administered 0.3 mg kg-1 of the drug to schizophrenic individuals during a [15O] water cerebral blood flow study. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H2(15)O and positron emission tomography (PET) before and after ketamine administration to identify regions of flow change, rCBF was increased in anterior cingulate cortex and was reduced in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex (lingual and fusiform gyri).

"5684","A single infusion of intravenous ketamine improves pain relief in patients with critical limb ischaemia: results of a double blind randomised controlled trial.^\nWe report the first double blind randomised controlled trial of regular opioids and an infusion of low dose (0.6 mg/kg) intravenous ketamine compared with opioids and placebo in patients with allodynia, hyperalgesia and hyperpathia secondary to critical limb ischaemia. Thirty-five patients completed the study, 18 received regular opioids plus ketamine, while 17 received regular opioids plus placebo. Using the Brief Pain Inventory, the % pain relief that the patients in the ketamine group attributed to their medication improved significantly from 50% immediately pre-infusion to 65% 24 h post-infusion and 69% 5 days post infusion. Over the same period, the pain relief achieved by the placebo group rose from 58% pre-infusion to 56% 24 h post infusion and then 50% relief 5 days later. This was statistically significant (P<0.05) using both the t-test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The ketamine group also showed a statistically significant difference 24 h post infusion of the effect of pain on their general activity (P=0.03) and on their enjoyment of life (P=0.004). This study shows that combining a single infusion of low dose ketamine with regular opioid analgesia can result in a significant improvement in pain relief for this patient group.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6084","Role of the Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor in LSD-induced Altered States of Consciousness (LDR-Study).^\nSerotonin receptors, especially the 5HT2A receptor, are thought to be involved in the effects of various recreationally used psychedelic substances such as LSD. LSD potently stimulates the 5‐HT2A receptor but also 5‐HT2B/C, 5‐HT1 and dopaminergic receptors. LSD induces acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including visual perceptual alterations, audio‐visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization. LSD has therefore been used as experimental tool (""psychotomimetic"") in modern psychiatric research to study psychotic‐like states and model psychosis in healthy subjects [1‐5]. However, the dose‐effects of 5‐HT2A receptor stimulation by LSD has not yet been studied. Additionally, there is still very limited data to what extent the 5HT2A receptor contributes to LSD's effects and its role in the mediation of the full response to LSD at a high dose is unclear. A recent experimental human study showed the 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin fully blocked the subjective effects of a moderate dose of 100 µg of LSD [6]. But, whether the effects of a high 200 µg oral dose of LSD can be blocked by the selective pharmacological 5‐HT2A antagonist ketanserin remains to be tested to confirm the critical role of the 5‐HT2A receptor in more pronounced alterations of consciousness and perception. The present study therefore explores the role the 5‐HT2A receptor in LSD‐induced altered states of consciousness using escalating doses of LSD and the 5‐HT2A receptor blocker ketanserin administered before a high dose of LSD.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"6427","NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia: an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI.^\nBACKGROUND: Based on animal data, NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia. NMDA receptor hypofunction affects several corticolimbic brain regions, of which the posterior cingulate seems to be the most sensitive. However, empirical support for a crucial role of posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms is still missing in humans. We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval, which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate. METHODS: We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either placebo (n = 7; saline) or ketamine (n = 9; 0.6 mg/kg/h) group in a double-blind study design. All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic memory retrieval task in the scanner. Immediately after the fMRI session, psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. RESULTS: The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and anterior cingulate during retrieval. Signal increases were significantly lower in the ketamine group. Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated significantly with positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms induced by ketamine. CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship between NMDA receptors, posterior cingulate and positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms in humans. Confirming findings from animal studies, it supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6558","The effects of a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine on human selective attention.^\nTested the hypothesis that a sub-anaesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, ketamine, would induce psychophysiological and selective attention anomalies in healthy Ss that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg/kg ketamine. Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard (80%) and deviant tones (20%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear. Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy Ss that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"7943","A randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study of efficacy, safety, and durability of repeated vs single subanesthetic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nThe strategy of repeated ketamine in open-label and saline-control studies of treatment-resistant depression suggested greater antidepressant response beyond a single ketamine. However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8219","Body mass index (BMI) does not predict responses to psilocybin.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist and naturally occurring psychedelic. 5-HT2A receptor density is known to be associated with body mass index (BMI), however, the impact of this on psilocybin therapy has not been explored. While body weight-adjusted dosing is widely used, this imposes a practical and financial strain on the scalability of psychedelic therapy. This gap between evidence and practice is caused by the absence of studies clarifying the relationship between BMI, the acute psychedelic experience and long-term psychological outcomes. Method: Data were pooled across three studies using a fixed 25 mg dose of psilocybin delivered in a therapeutic context to assess whether BMI predicts characteristics of the acute experience and changes in well-being 2 weeks later. Supplementing frequentist analysis with Bayes Factors has enabled for conclusions to be drawn regarding the null hypothesis. Results: Results support the null hypothesis that BMI does not predict overall intensity of the altered state, mystical experiences, perceptual changes or emotional breakthroughs during the acute experience. There was weak evidence for greater ‘dread of ego dissolution’ in participants with lower BMI, however, further analysis suggested BMI did not meaningfully add to the combination of the other covariates (age, sex and study). While mystical-type experiences and emotional breakthroughs were strong predictors of improvements in well-being, BMI was not. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for our understanding of pharmacological and extra-pharmacological contributors to psychedelic-assisted therapy and for the standardization of a fixed therapeutic dose in psychedelic-assisted therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8752","Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations. While these data are reassuring, it is important for each treatment case to fully explore potential cardiovascular risks prior to initiating treatment.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"9611","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.
