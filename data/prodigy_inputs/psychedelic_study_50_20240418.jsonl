{"record_id": 6274, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Morphine']", "text": "PCA Ketamine-Morphine VS PCA Morphine as Post-Operative Analgesia in Colorectal Surgery.^\nINTRODUCTION Patient\u2010controlled analgesia (PCA) is an established, efficient and safe technique for providing postoperative analgesia and has been associated with better pain relief and patient satisfaction with less postoperative complications and side effects [1]. Despite years of advances in pain management, opioids have been the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain particularly in moderate to severe pain. Of all opioids, morphine is the most studied drug and remains the drug of choice for PCA, especially in Malaysian hospitals. However, morphine usage is also associated with known side effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression [2]. A review of 32 studies involving opioids\u2010based PCA\u201022 of which were PCA morphine\u2010reported an incidence of 19% nausea, 18.1% vomiting, 30.9 % of nausea and/or vomiting, 25.7% sedation, 17.9% urinary retention, 17.9% pruritus and 15.2% hypoxia and 1.6% respiratory depression that may be life\u2010threatening associated with PCA opioids use [3, 4]. The concept of multimodal analgesia hence was introduced to reduce opioid\u2010related side effects. Adjuvants such as acetaminophen and non\u2010steroidal anti\u2010inflammatory drugs are commonly used nowadays in combination with opioids as opioid\u2010sparing agents to reduce opioid usage [5]. Ketamine, an N\u2010methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has undergone a recent resurgence of interest among acute care providers as an adjunct in acute pain management [6, 7]. Ketamine at a sub\u2010anesthetic dose (0.2\u20100.5 mg kg\u20101) produces intense analgesia [5, 8]. Since its development in 1962, various studies have been conducted to prove the efficacy of ketamine as post\u2010operative analgesia and as an opioid\u2010sparing agent [8\u201010]. A review by Laskowski and colleagues described that IV ketamine improved the quality of pain control, in addition to decreased opioid consumption with the particular benefit being observed in painful procedures, such as upper abdominal, thoracic, and major orthopedic surgeries [11]. While Carstensen and co\u2010workers in a qualitative review comparing PCA ketamine\u2010morphine with PCA morphine alone also described the superior efficacy of ketamine\u2010morphine in providing pain control with a significantly higher incidence of opioid\u2010related side effects in the morphine group [12]. In comparison to opioids, ketamine's lack of respiratory depressant effects also favors its use as an opioid adjunct in patients with airway and respiratory compromise, especially in morbid obesity and post\u2010thoracotomy patients [13, 14]. Despite the potential efficacy with published evidence of PCA ketamine\u2010morphine in postoperative pain management, its use is not well established in most Malaysian hospitals including the current study site. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA ketamine\u2010morphine in comparison to conventional PCA morphine alone as postoperative analgesia in colorectal surgery patients in the current study site. METHODS This prospective double\u2010blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru from February to October 2018 after obtaining ethics approval from the local and institutional ethics committee (NMRR\u201017\u20101863\u201037291 & JEP\u20102018\u2010092). Sixty elective American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients scheduled for lower midline laparotomy colorectal surgery aged between 18\u201070 years old were recruited and informed consents were obtained. Patients with a known allergy to morphine or ketamine, uncontrolled hypertension, past history of chronic pain on regular analgesics, psychiatric illness on psychiatric drugs, BMI more than 35 and creatine clearance less than 30 were excluded from the study. All patients who consented were taught the usage of a PCA machine and the potential side effects of ketamine and morphine preoperatively. They were randomly allocated into either Group A or Group B by computer\u2010generated randomization a day before planned surgery. Group A r ceived PCA ketamine (Ketamine HCl, Pfizer Inc., US) 0.5 mg plus morphine 0.5 mg ml\u20101 (ratio 1:1) while Group B received PCA morphine (Pfizer Inc., US) 1 mg ml\u20101 as postoperative analgesia. There was no baseline infusion and the lock\u2010out period was set to 5 minutes. The study drugs were prepared one day before the surgery by the pharmacist who was not involved in the intraoperative and post\u2010=operative management of the patients. The drugs were labelled as study drugs with the study number. The patients, nurses who cared for the patients, the anesthetist who performed the anesthesia and the investigators who gathered the data were blinded to patients' group allocation. All patients had standard monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation and end\u2010tidal carbon dioxide (CO2). They were pre\u2010oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 2\u20103 minutes. The induction of general anesthesia was standardized to intravenous (IV) fentanyl (Cephalon Inc., US) 2 mcg kg\u20101, IV propofol (Diprivan, Pfizer Inc., US) 2 mg kg\u20101 and IV rocuronium (US) 0.6 mg kg\u20101 and intubation with the appropriate size of the endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (Suprane, Novartis AG, Switzerland) in a mixture of 50% of oxygen and 50% of air, and titrated to achieve a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1.0. All patients received IV dexamethasone (US) 8 mg after induction and IV morphine 0.1 mg kg\u20101 as intraoperative analgesia. Boluses of IV fentanyl 25 mcg were given if extra analgesia was required and recorded. IV ondansetron (US) 4 mg was given upon initiation of skin closure. The skin incision site was infiltrated with 0.25% Bupivacaine (US) 10\u201020 ml during skin closure. The standard dose of IV neostigmine and IV atropine was used to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. At the recovery bay, pain score was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), by which patients scored their pain intensity between number 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. If the pain score was > 4 at rest, IV morphine boluses were given and titrated according to the pre\u2010set morphine protocol until the pain score was \u2264 4. PCA machine with the study drug(s) was commenced once the pain score was \u2264 4 at rest. Patients were assessed 30 minutes after the commencement of PCA, at 6 hourly intervals for the first 24 hours and subsequently at 12 hourly intervals for the next 24 hours post\u2010operatively by the Acute Pain Service (APS) team. They were solely on PCA as post\u2010operative analgesia as the patients were kept nil by mouth for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All patients were assessed for pain score, sedation score, respiratory rate and other side effects of morphine and ketamine including nausea and vomiting, pruritus, dizziness and hallucinations. If the pain score was > 4 at rest during the assessment, 2 ml of PCA drug was given as boluses and titrated every 10 minutes to achieve a pain score \u2264 4. Cumulative morphine consumption was also recorded. Sedation was assessed using Pasero Opioid\u2010Induced Sedation Scale (POSS) (S \u2010 sleep, easy to arouse, 1 \u2010 awake and alert, 2 \u2010 slightly drowsy, easy to arouse, 3 \u2010 frequently drowsy, arousable, drift to sleep during the conversation, 4 \u2010 somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal or physical stimulation). Treatment for nausea, vomiting and pruritus was given as deemed appropriate and recorded. At 48\u2010hour post\u2010operation, the patient's overall satisfaction score was assessed using 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 \u2010 very unsatisfied, 2 \u2010 unsatisfied, 3 \u2010 neutral, 4 \u2010 satisfied and 5 \u2010 very satisfied). If patients experience hallucinations or delirium, PCA bolus dose was reduced by 0.2 ml and the symptoms were reassessed after 1 hour. If symptoms persist, the PCA bolus dose was reduced further by 0.2 ml every hour until symptoms disappear and PCA subsequently continued at the reduced dose. Patients with complicated surgeries in which they became haemodynamically unstable and required post\u2010operative ICU admission, developed anaphylaxis after commencement of study drugs, developed persistent delirium or hallucination after reduction of PCA bolus dose and pain was uncontrollable with the reduced dose or those who refused to continue with the study for any reasons were withdrawn from the study and given other means of analgesia as appropriate by the acute pain service (APS) team. The sample size was calculated using 'Power and Sample Size Calculations' program. The sample size was estimated using t\u2010test calculation as derived from mean pain score and standard deviation as quoted in a study by Javery and colleagues [15]. The \u03b1 value was set at 0.05 and power of study at 90% and standard deviation at 1.67, whereby it was estimated that 27 patients were required for each group. Anticipating a 10% drop\u2010out rate, 30 patients were eventually recruited in each group, resulting in 60 patients for the whole study. All data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for The Social Sciences) software. Chi\u2010square test or Fisher exact test was used when appropriate to calculate any significant differences for categorical variables. Independent t\u2010test or Mann Whitney U test was used as appropriate to determine any significant differences for continuous variables. The incidence of side effects between the two groups was compared using Chi\u2010square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06021717"}

Psilocybin, the chemical component of magic mushrooms , has been administered with psychotherapy in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showing large and sustained antidepressant effects. As the use of psilocybin expands, it is becoming more important to understand whether psilocybin's psychedelic effects are required for psilocybin's antidepressant effects. Psilocybin's psychedelic effects are known to be dependent on serotonin 2A receptor (5\u2010HT2AR) activation. Given the safety concerns associated with psilocybin's psychedelic effects, all studies have used it in conjunction with at least 12 hours of intensive psychotherapy. This makes psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy (PAP) highly resource intensive and impedes scalability given limited resources and access to trained therapists in most jurisdictions. Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are blocked by 5\u2010HT2AR antagonists like risperidone and ketanserin. In a preclinical study using a mouse model of depression, administration of ketanserin followed by psilocybin had the same antidepressant effect as psilocybin alone. We propose to conduct the first study to test in humans whether the antidepressant effects of psilocybin are attenuated by 5\u2010HT2AR blockade from risperidone. Objectives: Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of administering psilocybin with risperidone in adults with TRD by evaluating recruitment, retention, tolerability, and safety. Aim 2: To evaluate psychedelic effects (measured with the 5\u2010Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale) in the three groups. Aim 3: To evaluate antidepressant effects (measured with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS) in the three groups. . Methods: A three\u2010arm, 4\u2010week, double blind, proof\u2010of\u2010concept RCT for patients with a DSM\u20105 major depressive episode that has failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressants. Participants will be randomized to: 1) psilocybin 25 mg plus risperidone 1 mg; 2) psilocybin 25 mg plus placebo; 3) placebo plus risperidone 1 mg. All participants will receive 12 hours of manualized psychotherapy. Results: Ethics approval for the proposed study has been obtained. We will present preliminary feasibility data at the meeting in March. Conclusions: If the study demonstrates that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are not necessary for psilocybin's antidepressant effects, the combination of psilocybin and a 5\u2010HT2AR antagonist, such as risperidone, could increase acceptability and access to the use of psilocybin to treat MDD and related conditions.", "doi": "10.1192/j.eurpsy.2023.1175", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38385431/", "secondary_title": "European psychiatry"}

Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience. Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterized by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences.

Recent studies showing improvement in suicidal ideation has further increased the interest in its clinical use because when it works, it does so within hours, possibly reducing the risk of suicidal behavior. However, many issues need to be addressed before widespread clinical use can be recommended and definitive controlled trials can be designed. This includes the need for: a) a better developed conceptual framework for the mechanisms underlying Ketamine's antidepressant and nocioceptive properties; b) a clinical algorithm guiding appropriate selection of patients (e.g., first episode vs. treatment resistant depressed patients; presence of suicidal ideation; or patients with co\u2010occurring chronic pain); c) the identification of dosing strategies or adjunct agents that can extend the therapeutic effect; d) optimization of Ketamine administration protocols (i.e., intramuscular vs. intravenous route of administration and bolus vs. infusion, maximally effective dose, and consequences of concurrent benzodiazepines administration); e) larger placebo\u2010controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Ketamine in the treatment of suicidal ideation; f) knowledge regarding the psychiatric medications that patients can be taking prior to receiving the treatment; and g) identification of predictive biomarkers and/or illness subtypes more likely to benefit from Ketamine treatment. Methods: Clinical cases of Ketamine administration for depression, suicidal ideation, and pain at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio are being reviewed for this presentation. Clinical chart data and available rating scales will be summarized. When used for treatment of depression, Ketamine is largely administered as in the previously published depression trials (0.5 mg/kg) in 40\u2010 minute IV infusion. For the treatment of chronic pain and in few cases of depression, much higher doses of Ketamine (up to 2 mg/ kg) are administered as IV bolus along with concurrent benzodiazepines (most often midazolam). Ketamine administration is largely conducted in outpatient settings under direct physician supervision by an anesthesiologist with constant monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation). Full psychiatric evaluations were conducted before the treatment and psychiatric follow was done within 1\u20103 days after Ketamine administration. For most depressed patients, mood ratings were collected using the HAMD\u201017, HAMD\u20107, QIDS\u2010SR16 and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). Assessment of pain severity was based on ratings severity from 0=No pain to 10=Extreme pain. Results: In agreement with published literature a single Ketamine infusion rapidly alleviated depressive symptomatology (response) in more than half of our patients. The treatment is well tolerated without major side effects. In some patients with comorbid pain, pain also decreased. Most patients first noticed improvement in mood the day after infusion. Although in a patient with severe MDD and residual suicidal ideation after a suicide attempt of high lethality, a sustained clinical response (including resolution of suicidality) was noted as soon as 120 minutes after the infusion began. In one case of severe post\u2010partum depression, a single bolus infusion of Ketamine (with concurrent use of midazolam) led to a sustained complete remission of symptoms (leading to patient discontinuing her SSRI) that was maintained for 2 months (date of last follow up). Conclusions: A growing body of clinical and research data suggest Ketamine may have clinical utility in some cases of depression and chronic pain.

Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to initiate addiction recovery, and two single\u2010dose, adherenceindependent, pharmacologic interventions \u2010 intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone \u2010 are well\u2010suited to administer before discharge. However, their feasibility and effectiveness at reducing re\u2010admissions among AUD inpatients are not well established. Methods: Our open\u2010label pilot trial randomized participants to 1) IM naltrexone injection, 2) IV ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced\u2010linkage alone. Adult (age 18\u201065), hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past\u2010year hospital encounter were recruited through an addiction consultation service at an urban, safety\u2010net hospital. Exclusion criteria included psychiatric instability, severe hepatic or cardiac disease, chronic or planned opioid use, and other severe substance use disorders. The primary aim was to test feasibility, and the primary clinical outcome was 30\u2010day, all\u2010cause re\u2010admission rate. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30\u2010day emergency department (ED) visit rate and 14\u2010day outpatient addiction clinic follow\u2010up rate. Results: Participants (n = 44) were mean 45.1 years\u2010old, 20.5% female, 56.8% white/Caucasian, 34.1% Hispanic, 61.4% stably housed. All interventions were feasible, with approximately 3.8 participants recruited per month, no serious adverse events reported, and 90.9% with complete inpatient protocol adherence. For the linkage\u2010alone (LA), naltrexone (NTX), and ketamine (KET) arms, the thirty\u2010day readmission rates were 41.2, 21.4, and 15.4% respectively. Thirty\u2010day emergency department rates were 70.6, 57.1, and 53.9% respectively. Fourteen\u2010day follow up rates were 41.2, 50.0, and 61.5% respectively. Comparing the KET arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission was 0.37 (P = 0.17). Comparing the NTX arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission 0.52 (P = 0.27) DISCUSSION: A single ketamine infusion or naltrexone injection given pre\u2010discharge, combined with enhanced treatment linkage, are feasible and may reduce readmission rates among medically hospitalized patients with AUD, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with Dakwar et al. [3] who demonstrated beneficial effects with a single ketamine infusion compared to their active control, midazolam, among a lower\u2010acuity AUD population. IM naltrexone \u2010 representing an aspirational standard of care \u2010 also demonstrated favorable outcomes compared to the LA arm. A lack of blinding may have introduced expectancy effects for the two pharmacologic interventions. Moreover, despite randomization, the linkage alone arm appeared to be more housing insecure, male, and predisposed to care utilization than the other arms. The ketamine arm had a lower baseline daily quantity of alcohol than the other arms. Next steps include further dissemination of results and planning a larger, blinded trial. If effective in recovery initiation, IV ketamine and/or IM naltrexone could represent a novel addition to the inpatient standard of care for AUD. Conclusions: In this randomized pilot trial among hospitalized AUD patients, both the ketamine infusion and naltrexone injection arms showed lower readmission rates and higher outpatient follow\u2010up rates compared to the linkage alone arm, though results were not statistically significant.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "Journal of addiction medicine"}

Similar findings were observed in a glutamatergic model of psychosis, but the role of serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors in information processing is less clear. OBJECTIVES: We studied ERPs in a serotonergic model of psychosis, induced by psilocybin, a psychedelic with 5-HT(2A/C) agonistic properties, in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty subjects (10M/10F) were given 0.26\u00a0mg/kg of psilocybin orally in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. ERPs (P300, MMN) were registered during the peak of intoxication. Correlations between measured electrophysiological variables and psilocin serum levels and neuropsychological effects were also analyzed. RESULTS: Psilocybin induced robust psychedelic effects and psychotic-like symptoms, decreased P300 amplitude (p\u2009=\u20090.009) but did not affect the MMN. Psilocybin's disruptive effect on P300 correlated with the intensity of the psychedelic state, which was dependent on the psilocin serum levels. We also observed a decrease in N100 amplitude (p\u2009=\u20090.039) in the P300 paradigm and a negative correlation between P300 and MMN amplitude (p\u2009=\u20090.014). CONCLUSIONS: Even though pre-attentive cognition (MMN) was not affected, processing at the early perceptual level (N100) and in higher-order cognition (P300) was significantly disrupted by psilocybin.

Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic.

Design Test-re-test study. Participants MDMA users (life-time use >5 times) were recruited in St Louis, Miami and Sydney (n = 593). The median life-time MDMA consumption was 50 pills at the baseline. Measurements The computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drug (CD-SAM) was used to assess MDMA abuse and dependence. The Discrepancy Interview Protocol (DIP) was used to determine the reasons for the discrepant responses between the two interviews. Reliability of diagnoses, individual diagnostic criteria and withdrawal symptoms was examined using the kappa coefficient (\u03ba). Findings For baseline data, 15% and 59% met MDMA abuse and dependence, respectively. Substantial test-re-test reliability of the diagnoses was observed consistently across cities (\u03ba = 0.69). 'Continued use despite knowledge of physical/psychological problems' (87%) and 'withdrawal' (68%) were the two most prevalent dependence criteria. 'Physically hazardous use' was the most prevalent abuse criterion. Six dependence criteria and all abuse criteria were reported reliably across cities (\u03ba: 0.53-0.77). Seventeen of 19 withdrawal symptoms showed consistency in the reliability across cities. The most commonly reported reason for discrepant responses was 'interpretation of question changed'. Only a small proportion of the total discrepancies were attributed to lying or social desirability.

AIMS: We aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Psyrreal and psychedelic VR experiences in treating depressive symptoms as well as explore the effect of Psyrreal on subjective factors which have been suggested to mediate the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics. METHODS: In this open-label feasibility study, thirteen participants with mild-to-moderate depression underwent a 2-day therapeutic intervention implementing Psyrreal. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q2) at the start of the intervention and 2 weeks after. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews after Psyrreal was also conducted as an additional assessment of the method. RESULTS: A 2-day intervention implementing Psyrreal led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms at the 2-week follow-up (n = 10, p = 0.007, Hedges' g = 1.046) measured by the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q2). The analysis of semi-structured interviews suggests that Psyrreal could lead to insight and alterations in the sense of self in some people.

We aimed to assess the efficacy of ketamine in major depressive episodes. METHOD: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Medline from 1962 to January 2014 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post-treatment. Analyses employed a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from seven RCTs employing an intravenous infusion and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 73 subjects in parallel arms and 110 subjects in cross-over designs [n = 34 with bipolar disorder (BD), n = 149 with major depressive disorder (MDD)].

Aim: The aim of the current analysis was to examine potential effects of concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines on the safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray following first\u2010dose treatment of patients in urgent need of symptom control. Methods: Post\u2010hoc analyses of pooled data from two randomized double\u2010blind studies of esketamine (ASPIRE\u20101 [NCT03039192], ASPIRE\u20102 [NCT03097133]) [1, 2] were performed. Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), active suicidal ideation with intent, and need for psychiatric hospitalization were randomized to placebo or esketamine 84mg nasal spray twice\u2010weekly for 4 weeks, each with comprehensive standard\u2010of\u2010care (initial hospitalization and newly\u2010initiated or optimized oral antidepressant[s]). Efficacy and safety were each analyzed in two groups, based on whether or not patients used benzodiazepines. For efficacy assessments, which were performed on day 2 (24 hours post\u2010initial dose), benzodiazepine users included patients who took a benzodiazepine(s) between day \u20102 and day 2. For safety assessments, including Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale, that were assessed up to 1.5 hours post\u2010dose, benzodiazepine users included patients who took a benzodiazepine(s) on day \u20102 and/or day \u20101 (before dosing of study drug began). The protocol prohibited benzodiazepine use within 8 hours prior to and 4 hours post dosing and 8 hours prior to day 2 efficacy assessments. The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to 24 hours post\u2010first dose in Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score \u2013 was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: In the ASPIRE studies, 456 patients were randomized to study drug. Four patients (2 in each treatment group) were excluded from analyses of efficacy and safety because they did not receive a dose of intranasal study drug; 1 additional patient (in the esketamine group) was excluded from analyses of efficacy due to absence of post\u2010baseline MADRS assessments. Most patients (309/451, 68.5%) used concomitant benzodiazepines. Mean MADRS total score decreased from baseline to 24 hours post\u2010first dose in both treatment groups, with greater improvement in depressive symptoms among those treated with esketamine plus standard\u2010of\u2010care as compared to placebo plus standard\u2010of\u2010care. The between\u2010group difference favored esketamine over placebo among patients taking benzodiazepines (difference of least squares, LS, means [95% CI]: \u20104.3 [\u20106.63 to \u20101.89]) and also among patients who did not take benzodiazepines (\u20103.1 [\u20106.62 to 0.45]). For patients in the esketamine plus standard\u2010of\u2010care group, decrease in MADRS total score was numerically but not statistically significantly greater among those not taking benzodiazepines (mean [SD]: \u201016.8 [12.82]) versus those taking benzodiazepines (\u201015.8 [11.27]) (difference of LS means [95% CI], 1.1 [\u20102.24 to 4.45]). Among esketamine\u2010treated patients, the incidence of sedation was numerically higher with benzodiazepine use (8.1% vs. 1.3%), whereas the incidence of dissociation was similar (32.0% vs. 26.6%). Conclusions: The findings from the ASPIRE studies suggest that while efficacy of esketamine is not attenuated or enhanced by use of benzodiazepines, an increased rate of sedation was observed in MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent.

This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5\u202fmg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n\u202f=\u202f5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual.

RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5 at baseline to 2.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5 at study endpoint.

Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions.

TRD was commonly coupled with functional impairment, poor quality of life, suicide ideation and attempts, self-injurious behaviors, and a high relapse rate. From 2012 and 2015, we had conducted the first randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial in Asian countries to examine the therapeutic efficacy of a single low-dose ketamine infusion in Taiwanese patients with TRD. Seventy one subjects were evenly distributed in three dose groups with 0.5 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, and placebo, respectively. Responder was identified by response (\u2265 50% reduction of mood ratings) at any two daily HAMD measures during the period of 24-96 h (day 2-5) post-ketamine infusion. There was a significant difference in the response rate across the three groups (0.5 mg/kg: 45.8%; 0.2 mg/kg: 39.1%; placebo: 12.5%; p = 0.03), which is much lower than that in the Caucasians (70%). Two factors might be related: lower serum ketamine levels and lower Val/Val allele percentage in BDNF Val66Met genotyping found in the Taiwanese patients. In addition to the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine, a greater antisuicidal effect (59%) was also identified. The former may only account for 52.7% of the latter, indicating that the antisuicidality may be independent from antidepressiveness. Single dose of ketamine only resulted in short-lived psychedelic/dissociation adverse effect, which was resolved within 2 h post-infusion. Up to present, no long-term side effects were identified, given a single-dose administration. Using 18F-FDG-PET scanning and 24 h post-ketamine infusion, glucose metabolism of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were activated immediately (40 min post-infusion), and activation of SMA and dACC could sustain for 1 day, which may contribute to the persistent antidepressant effect of ketamine beyond its half-life, suggesting that a short activation in the PFC engendered by ketamine infusion may be a kindler, facilitating the persistent increase in glucose metabolism in the SMA and dACC; therefore, the PFC may be still considered to play a key role in improving TRD. These findings were also supported by a simple wearable forehead EEG monitoring from baseline to 40 min post-infusion, revealing that ketamine may increase the theta and low alpha power and decrease asymmetry in the PFC. Finally, a maintenance trial in a double-blind, randomized fashion using a partial NMDA agonist, d-cycloserine (DCS) vs. placebo, was conducted in the ketamine responders. This DCS augmentation treatment was not superior to placebo in maintaining the initial antidepressant response to ketamine infusion, but DCS did appear to maintain the antisuicidal effect during the 6-week follow-up study. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.", "doi": "10.1007/978-981-15-2902-3_11", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38633273/", "secondary_title": "Ketamine: From Abused Drug to Rapid-Acting Antidepressant"}

In animals, MDMA damages brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons at doses that overlap with those used recreationally by some humans. To date, few functional sequelae of MDMA-induced 5-HT damage have been identified. OBJECTIVE: Since serotonin is thought to be involved in cognitive processes, and since previous studies have reported verbal and visual memory deficits in MDMA users, the present study sought to determine whether other cognitive processes are influenced by previous exposure to MDMA. METHODS: Twenty-two MDMA users who had not used MDMA for at least 3 weeks and 23 control subjects were tested repeatedly with a computerized cognitive performance assessment battery while participating in a 5-day controlled inpatient study. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) measures of monoamine metabolites were also collected as an index of brain monoaminergic function. RESULTS: MDMA users and controls were found to perform similarly on several cognitive tasks. However, MDMA subjects had significant performance deficits on a sustained attention task requiring arithmetic calculations, a task requiring complex attention and incidental learning, a task requiring short term memory and a task of semantic recognition and verbal reasoning. MDMA users also had significant selective decreases in CSF 5-HIAA.

That study and subsequent ones have demonstrated that low dose, infused ketamine is able to induce a remission of depression in patients who have failed conventional medications, within 24 h. The apparent increased efficacy and rapid onset of effect of ketamine distinguish it from all other current antidepressant treatments. However, a single infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine produces benefits that typically last <3 weeks. The infusions are associated with a transient \"psychedelic\" experience and increased blood pressure that requires monitoring. There is also a theoretical potential to induce ketamine addiction. These features limit ketamine's ability to be a widely used treatment for depression and thus limit is ability to have a meaningful impact on the heavy morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, despite its \"breakthrough\" rate of efficacy and speed of action. While growing numbers of clinicians are using ketamine to treat treatment resistant depression, many in the depression field believe that the aforementioned limiting aspects need to be separated from its remarkable therapeutic effects in order to unlock the breakthrough potential of this agent. To that end, drug development efforts have focused on various features of ketamine as targets for optimization including its modulation of the NMDA receptor, its pharmacokinetics, its chirality and its active metabolites including HNK (2R, 6R)-hyroxynorketamine.

We explored the impact of Val66Met on the response to repeated ketamine or esketamine exposures in TRD patients. Methods: DNA was genotyped from esketamine (0.20 or 0.40 mg/ kg IV single dose=study 1), ketamine (0.50 mg/kg IV 4\u20106 times over 2 weeks=study 2) or placebo treated patients.

Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular level mechanisms of these drugs, knowledge of their actions on global brain dynamics is still incomplete. Recent imaging studies have found changes in functional coupling between frontal and parietal brain structures, suggesting a modification in information flow between brain regions during acute effects. METHODS: Here we assessed the psychedelic-induced changes in directionality of information flow during the acute effects of a psychedelic in humans. We measured modifications in connectivity of brain oscillations using transfer entropy, a nonlinear measure of directed functional connectivity based on information theory. Ten healthy male volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics participated in 2 experimental sessions. They received a placebo or a dose of ayahuasca, a psychedelic preparation containing the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine. RESULTS: The analysis showed significant changes in the coupling of brain oscillations between anterior and posterior recording sites. Transfer entropy analysis showed that frontal sources decreased their influence over central, parietal, and occipital sites. Conversely, sources in posterior locations increased their influence over signals measured at anterior locations. Exploratory correlations found that anterior-to-posterior transfer entropy decreases were correlated with the intensity of subjective effects, while the imbalance between anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior transfer entropy correlated with the degree of incapacitation experienced.

A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes. Most participants completed infusion (21/23; mean final dose 0.54 mg/kg/h, SD 0.13). The infusion was well tolerated with minimal cognitive and psychotomimetic side effects. Depressive symptoms were markedly reduced (MADRS 29 \u00b1 4 at baseline to 9 \u00b1 8 one day post-infusion), which was sustained at 2 weeks (13 \u00b1 8) and 8 weeks (15 \u00b1 8). Imaging demonstrated a response-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex to the default mode network, and a treatment-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity within the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens). In exploratory analyses, connectivity was increased between the limbic system and frontal areas, and smaller right hippocampus volume at baseline predicted larger MADRS change. A single prolonged infusion of ketamine provides a tolerated, rapid, and sustained response in treatment-resistant depression and normalizes depression-related hyperconnectivity in the limbic system and frontal lobe.

Moreover, it was consistently shown that abstinent MDMA users have memory deficits. Recently, it was supposed that these deficits are an expression of a temporal or rather hippocampal dysfunction caused by the serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA. The aim of this study is to examine the memory deficits of MDMA users neuropsychologically in order to evaluate the role of different brain regions. Nineteen male abstinent MDMA users, 19 male abstinent cannabis users and 19 male drug-naive control subjects were examined with a German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). MDMA users showed widespread and marked verbal memory deficits, compared to drug-naive controls as well as compared to cannabis users, whereas cannabis users did not differ from control subjects in their memory performance. MDMA users revealed impairments in learning, consolidation, recall and recognition. In addition, they also showed a worse recall consistency and strong retroactive interference whereby both measures were previously associated with frontal lobe function. There was a significant correlation between memory performance and the amount of MDMA taken.

Current human research with psychedelics and entactogens has explored the possibility that drugs displaying agonist activity at the 5-HT(2A/2C) sites temporally disrupt inhibitory neural mechanisms thought to intervene in the normal filtering of information. Suppression of the P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) and prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) are considered operational measures of sensory (P50 suppression) and sensorimotor (PPI) gating. Contrary to findings in lower animals, unexpected increases in sensorimotor gating have been found in humans following the administration of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin and the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In addition, to our knowledge P50 suppression has not been assessed previously in humans following the administration of a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the acute administration of ayahuasca on P50 suppression and PPI in humans, in order to evaluate the drug's modulatory actions on these measures of sensory and sensorimotor gating. METHODS: Eighteen healthy volunteers with prior experience of psychedelic drug use participated in a clinical trial in which placebo or ayahuasca doses (0.6 mg and 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight) were administered according to a double-blind, cross-over balanced design. P50 and startle reflex (pulse-alone and 60 ms, 120 ms, 240 ms and 2000 ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals) recordings were undertaken at 1.5 h and 2 h after drug intake, respectively. RESULTS: Ayahuasca produced diverging effects on each of the two gating measures evaluated.

The objective was to ascertain whether there were differences in response to a single administration of ketamine for TRD between men and women, and between pre- and post-menopausal women. METHODS: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (N\u202f=\u202f99; N\u202f=\u202f50 male; N\u202f=\u202f49 female) was conducted to investigate the efficacy of intravenous ketamine versus active placebo as augmentation of antidepressant therapy for TRD. Patients were assigned to one of five arms; one-time administration of ketamine of varying doses (i.e., 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, and 1.0\u202fmg/kg), and one group receiving active placebo (intravenous midazolam). A priori-planned analyses were conducted to compare responses between women and men, as well pre-vs. postmenopausal women. RESULTS: Analyses demonstrated no significant differences between women and men in terms of treatment response (F(1,80)\u202f=\u202f0.06, p\u202f=\u202f0.80). There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse effects (AEs) reported by those assigned to ketamine treatment groups (p\u202f>\u202f0.21 for all AEs reported more than once), although women reported more headaches (12% vs. 6%, p\u202f=\u202f0.30) and nausea (10% vs. 6%, p\u202f=\u202f0.47). In comparing pre-vs. postmenopausal women, no differences in efficacy were observed (F(1,76)\u202f=\u202f0.36, p\u202f=\u202f0.55). CONCLUSIONS: Results do not support differential efficacy or tolerability of ketamine for the treatment of TRD between women and men, nor based on menopause status among women.

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze data about clinical efficacy and safety for ketamine and ECT in patients with major depressive episode. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase were systematically searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text keywords from database inception through April 19, 2022, with no language limits. Two authors also manually and independently searched all relevant studies in US and European clinical trial registries and Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Included were studies that involved (1) a diagnosis of depression using standardized diagnostic criteria, (2) intervention/comparator groups consisting of ECT and ketamine, and (3) depressive symptoms as an efficacy outcome using standardized measures. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. Hedges g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in depressive symptoms. SMDs with corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using fixed- or random-effects models. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy outcomes included depression severity, cognition, and memory performance. Safety outcomes included serious adverse events (eg, suicide attempts and deaths) and other adverse events. RESULTS: Six clinical trials comprising 340 patients (n\u2009=\u2009162 for ECT and n\u2009=\u2009178 for ketamine) were included in the review. Six of 6 studies enrolled patients who were eligible to receive ECT, 6 studies were conducted in inpatient settings, and 5 studies were randomized clinical trials. The overall pooled SMD for depression symptoms for ECT when compared with ketamine was -0.69 (95% CI, -0.89 to -0.48; Cochran Q, P\u2009=\u2009.15; I2\u2009=\u200939%), suggesting an efficacy advantage for ECT compared with ketamine for depression severity. Significant differences were not observed between groups for studies that assessed cognition/memory or serious adverse events. Both ketamine and ECT had unique adverse effect profiles (ie, ketamine: lower risks for headache and muscle pain; ECT: lower risks for blurred vision, vertigo, diplopia/nystagmus, and transient dissociative/depersonalization symptoms). Limitations included low to moderate methodological quality and underpowered study designs. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest that ECT may be superior to ketamine for improving depression severity in the acute phase, but treatment options should be individualized and patient-centered.", "doi": "10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2022.3352", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36260324/", "secondary_title": "JAMA Psychiatry"}

DESIGN: Cluster randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Secondary schools in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: 1126 students (aged 14.9 years) from 11 schools. INTERVENTION: Five schools were randomly allocated to the four-lesson internet-based Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs module. This universal intervention uses cartoon storylines to deliver harm-minimisation information about ecstasy and new psychoactive substances (NPS). It was delivered during health education classes over 4\u2009weeks. Six schools were randomised to the control group (health education as usual). Participants were not blinded to intervention allocation. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Students completed self-report surveys at baseline, post-test, 6, 12 and 24\u2009months post-baseline. Intentions to use ecstasy and NPS (including synthetic cannabis and synthetic stimulants), knowledge about ecstasy and NPS and lifetime use of ecstasy and NPS were assessed. This paper reports the results at 24\u2009months post-baseline. ANALYSIS: Mixed effects regressions were conducted to analyse intervention effects from baseline to 24\u2009months. Post hoc analyses using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting compared controls with students who: i) completed all four lessons ('full dose') and ii) partially completed the intervention (\u2264three lessons, 'incomplete dose'). RESULTS: Primary analyses found that controls were significantly more likely to intend on using synthetic cannabis compared with intervention group students (OR=3.56, p=0.01). Results from the weighted analyses indicated that controls reported significantly lower knowledge about ecstasy (p=0.001) and NPS (p=0.04) compared with the full-dose group. No significant differences were observed between the incomplete dose and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The online intervention was effective in modifying students' intentions to use synthetic cannabis up to 24\u2009months; however, this study highlights the importance of delivering prevention programmes in full to maximise student outcomes.

In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia.

There is no perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability.

The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding.

Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 \u03bcg/kg vs placebo) on both \u03b1 oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital \u03b1 power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced \u03b1 power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of \u03b1 oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1523/jneurosci.3007-12.2013", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23785166/", "secondary_title": "J Neurosci"}

To the authors knowledge, this this is the first report of an OCD patient being treated with intranasal ketamine, the first treated with multiple ketamine administrations, and the first treated with intensive ERP and repeated ketamine administrations. It is of course impossible, in examination of this single case, to determine whether ketamine and intensive CBT synergized to produce clinical benefit. It is possible that the patient benefited solely from inpatient CBT. Indeed, improvements in OCD symptoms were seen after 2 weeks of CBT and before ketamine was administered. These improvements may have also resulted from the lack of pertinent obsessive-compulsive triggers on the inpatient unit. Nonetheless, there are several reasons to believe that the patient benefited from ketamine: He reported additional symptom reductions following the initiation of ketamine treatments (this may have also been due to continued CBT). Compliance with response prevention drastically improved shortly after beginning ketamine, suggesting that ketamine may augment the process of ERP for OCD, and the patient reported rapid and drastic reductions in suicidal ideation following the first week of ketamine treatments. Further examination of the concurrent use of ketamine and extinction-based ERP for OCD is warranted.
