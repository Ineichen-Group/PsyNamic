PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo.

We examined blood‐oxygen‐level dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI) during an emotional processing task in patients with MDD to determine if pretreatment activation correlated with subsequent antidepressant response after ketamine. Methods: Participants included 31 patients with MDD, ages 18 to 65, who took part in this study as part of a large doubleblind placebo‐controlled protocol on the mechanism of action of ketamine. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after participants received an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). At baseline, BOLD signal was measured using a 3T GE fMRI scanner during an emotional processing task. In this mixed block/event‐related task, participants viewed faces with emotional expressions (angry, sad, neutral, and happy), randomly presented either rightside up or upside‐down. Participants were instructed to press a button to judge the emotion in one block and to identify the gender in the other block. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed using AFNI. Preprocessing included despiking, aligning images, registering echo‐planar to structural images, blurring to 6 mm, normalizing, and motion correction.

Results: We found a significant correlation between BOLD signal during the emotional processing task at baseline and percent change in MADRS score after ketamine.

The high rate of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia raises questions about how nicotine modulates putative NMDA receptor hypofunction in the illness. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation on NMDA receptor hypofunction by examining the interactive effects of nicotine, a nAChR agonist, and ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on behavioral and neurophysiological measures in healthy human volunteers. Methods: From an initial sample of 17 subjects (age range 18–55 years), 8 subjects successfully completed 4 test sessions, each separated by at least 3 days, during which they received ketamine or placebo and two injections of nicotine or placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced manner. Schizophrenia-like effects Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, perceptual alterations Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale, subjective effects Visual Analog Scale and auditory event-related brain potentials (mismatch negativity, MMN; P300) were assessed during each test session. Results: Consistent with existing studies, ketamine induced transient schizophrenia-like behavioral effects. P300 was reduced and delayed by ketamine regardless of whether it was elicited by a target (P3b) or novel (P3a) stimulus, while nicotine only reduced the amplitude of P3a. Nicotine did not rescue P300 from the effects of ketamine; the interactions of ketamine and nicotine were not significant. While nicotine significantly reduced MMN amplitude, ketamine did not. Conclusion: Nicotine failed to modulate ketamine-induced neurophysiological and behavioral effects in this preliminary study. Interestingly, ketamine reduced P3b amplitude and nicotine reduced P3a amplitude, suggesting independent roles of NMDA receptor and nAChR in the generation of P3b and P3a, respectively.

Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression.

OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada.

They attended four 5-hour drug-administration sessions separated by 3-4 days, followed by a drug-free follow-up session 3-4 days after the last session. LSD (26 μg) produced modest subjective effects including increased ratings of 'feeling a drug effect' and both stimulant-like and LSD-like effects, but the drug did not improve mood or affect performance on psychomotor or most emotional tasks. No residual effects were detected on mood or task performance on the drug-free follow-up session. We conclude that within the context of a controlled setting and a limited number of administrations, repeated low doses of LSD are safe, but produce negligible changes in mood or cognition in healthy volunteers.", "doi": "10.1111/adb.13143", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35106880/", "secondary_title": "Addict Biol", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

RESULTS: Participants in the clinically diagnosed drug dependent group scored significantly worse on the 'Quality of Working Memory' cognitive factor score than both the MDMA and control group (F (2, 33) = 5.75, p = 0.007). The control and clinical groups also differed on depression scores (U [16] = 13.00, p = 0.016) and Tension/Anxiety scores (U [16] = 16.00, p = 0.034), with the clinical group scoring significantly higher in both cases.

However, there is inconsistency across studies investigating the effect of ketamine for chronic pain management. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis in order to assess the efficacy of this compound during chronic non-cancer pain conditions. METHODS: The study consisted in a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing ketamine to a placebo during chronic non-cancer pain. The primary endpoint of this study was pain relief 4 weeks after the beginning of treatment. Secondary outcomes were: pain relief 1, 2, 8 and 12 weeks after the beginning of treatment and incidence of psychedelic manifestations. RESULTS: Six studies were included in this meta-analysis.

Exclusion criteria for this study include uncontrolled hypertension, blood pressure > 180/90 mmHg at the pre‐anesthesia clinic visit, renal failure, neurologic disorders (e.g. epilepsy, space occupying lesions, traumatic brain injuries in the past 6 months), myocardial infarction in the past 6 months, known allergies or adverse reactions to ketamine, American Society of Anesthesiology Physical Class greater than 3, concomitant psychosis, schizophrenia or current abuse of alcohol or illicit substances and pregnancy. The long term objective of this trial is to systematically characterize ketamine's effect on depression outcomes utilizing validated scoring tools, its safety profile throughout an ECT index course, ketamine's effect on seizure quality and changes in novel translational endpoints to better understand mechanisms of action of ketamine and its potential role in treatment of psychiatric disorders.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02752724", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint. MADRS scores diminished by 47% from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0. Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible. These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in \"real-world\" settings.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.073", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30107350/", "secondary_title": "J Affect Disord", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

AIM: Evaluate changes in resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) at 1 week and 3 months after one psilocybin dose in 10 healthy psychedelic-naïve volunteers and explore associations between change in RSFC and related measures. METHODS: Participants received 0.2-0.3 mg/kg psilocybin in a controlled setting.

We examined changes in within-network, between-network and region-to-region RSFC. We explored associations between changes in RSFC and psilocybin-induced phenomenology as well as changes in psychological measures and neocortex serotonin 2A receptor binding. RESULTS: Psilocybin was well tolerated and produced positive changes in well-being. At 1 week only, executive control network (ECN) RSFC was significantly decreased (Cohen's d = -1.73, pFWE = 0.010).

Previous systematic reviews assessing the efficacy of psilocybin in SUDs only included clinical trials conducted in the last 25 years, but they may have missed clinical trials assessing the efficacy of psilocybin that were conducted before the 1980s, given much research has been done with psychedelics in the mid-20th century. In this systematic review, we specifically assessed the efficacy of psilocybin in patients with a SUD or non-substance-related disorder with no publication date restrictions in our search strategy. METHODS: A systematic literature search was performed according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines from the earliest published manuscript up to September 2, 2022, in seven electronic databases, including clinical trials in patients with a SUD or non-substance-related disorder evaluating the efficacy of psilocybin. RESULTS: A total of four studies (six articles, of which two articles were long-term follow-up results from the same trial) were included in this systematic review. Psilocybin-assisted therapy was administered to n = 151 patients in a dose ranging from 6 to 40 mg. Three studies focused on alcohol use disorder, and one study on tobacco use disorder. In a pilot study (n = 10), the percentage of heavy drinking days decreased significantly between baseline and weeks 5-12 (mean difference of 26.0, 95% CI = 8.7-43.2, p = 0.008). In another single-arm study (n = 31), 32% (10/31) became completely abstinent from alcohol (mean duration of follow-up 6 years). In a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized controlled trial (RCT, n = 95), the percentage of heavy drinking days during the 32-week double-blind period was significantly lower for psilocybin compared to placebo (mean difference of 13.9, 95% CI = 3.0-24.7, p = 0.01). In a pilot study (n = 15), the 7-day point prevalence of smoking abstinence at 26 weeks was 80% (12/15), and at 52 weeks 67% (10/15).

Inhibitory deficits in the schizophrenia spectrum have been reliably reported using the antisaccade task. Interestingly, although similar antisaccade deficits have been reported following ketamine in non-human primates, ketamine-induced deficits have not been observed in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function during an antisaccade task, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on n = 15 healthy males. We measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and eye movements during a mixed antisaccade/prosaccade task while participants received a subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (target plasma level 100 ng/ml) on one occasion and placebo on the other occasion. RESULTS: While ketamine significantly increased self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences, it did not induce antisaccade or prosaccade performance deficits. At the level of BOLD, we observed an interaction between treatment and task condition in somatosensory cortex, suggesting recruitment of additional neural resources in the antisaccade condition under NMDAR blockage. DISCUSSION: Given the robust evidence of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia spectrum populations, the current findings suggest that ketamine may not mimic all features of psychosis at the dose used in this study.

Interestingly, although similar antisaccade deficits have been reported following ketamine in non-human primates, ketamine-induced deficits have not been observed in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function during an antisaccade task, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on n = 15 healthy males. We measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and eye movements during a mixed antisaccade/prosaccade task while participants received a subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (target plasma level 100 ng/ml) on one occasion and placebo on the other occasion. RESULTS: While ketamine significantly increased self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences, it did not induce antisaccade or prosaccade performance deficits.

Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 16 adolescent participants who participated in a randomized, single-dose, midazolam-controlled crossover trial of ketamine in adolescents with depression. We examined the association between the acute dissociative symptoms (measured at 60 minutes following start of infusion using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS], and its three subscales: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia) and response and depression symptom improvement at 1'day (using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). Results: Within the ketamine group, there were no significant associations between dissociation symptoms or CADSS subscale scores and magnitude of depression symptom improvement or likelihood of ketamine response. When receiving midazolam, there was no significant association between overall dissociation symptoms and magnitude or likelihood of response of depressive symptoms. Higher levels of symptoms on the 'depersonalization' CADSS subscale when receiving midazolam were associated with less improvement in depression symptoms at 1 day following infusion.

Conclusions: In contrast to some adult literature, the current data do not show a relationship between acute dissociative effects and antidepressant response to ketamine in pediatric patients with TRD. Interpretation may be limited by the small sample size, reducing the power to detect small or medium associations. Future research should utilize larger samples to more definitively measure the magnitude of association between acute dissociative symptoms and later antidepressant response to ketamine and to assess the relationship to trial design (e.g., crossover vs. parallel trial, comparison condition utilized and number of infusions) within both adult and pediatric populations.

Quantitative evidence has begun to emerge where human studies suggest that repeated recreational use of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or \"Ecstasy\") produces lasting impairments in explicit memory. The purpose of this investigation was to further explore the nature and pattern of component memory processes in abstinent MDMA users. Methods. Accordingly, 15 MDMA users and 17 matched normal controls completed a brief neuropsychological test battery composed mainly of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), a Stem-Completion task, and the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). Results. MDMA users were found impaired in terms of episodic prospective memory, as medium to large effects were observed between groups on time-based Appointment and event-based Message subtests of the RBMT.

METHODS: The present randomized, double-blinded controlled trial included 303 breast cancer patients with mild/moderate depression from June 2017 to June 2018. All patients were randomly divided into three groups: (1) control group, patients treated with normal saline; (2) racemic ketamine group, patients treated with racemic ketamine; (3) S-ketamine group, patients treated with S-ketamine. Operation time, blood loss and hospital stay and complications were recorded. The Visual Analog Scale (VAS) score was recorded, and the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD-17) scores, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) were measured at three days, one week, one month and three months after surgery. RESULTS: No significant difference was found in operation time, bleeding volume and complication rate. In both groups, the VAS scores at one day and three days after surgery were significantly lower. The HAMD-17 scores were significantly lower, and the serum levels of both BDNF and 5-HT were remarkably higher at three days, one week and one month after surgery. Meanwhile, the HAMD-17 scores were remarkably lower, while the serum levels of BDNF and 5-HT were remarkably higher in the S-ketamine group.

However, it is currently unknown whether these behavioral effects of MDMA are a consequence of an increase in risky choices or a change in reward‐driven behavior. To better understand the effects of MDMA on reward‐related decision‐making, as well as the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we modeled risky decision‐making following acute MDMA administration. Methods: Eighteen ecstasy users performed the Rogers' gambling task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after receiving a placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), or high (1.6 mg/kg) dose of MDMA, along with 18 controls, in a double‐blind, mixed between‐within subjects design. The Rogers' task requires participants to choose between variable (“experimental”) and fixed (“control”) gambles, following which they are given feedback regarding their choices. Behavioral analyses were carried out using the R statistical package. The AFNI fMRI package was used to analyze activation at the time of feedback, and also functional connectivity during the Rogers' task. Results: Relative to controls, ecstasy users were more likely to choose the risky option even without MDMA on board. However, acute administration of MDMA did not consistently influence the likelihood of choosing the experimental over control gambles, regardless of the (1) size, (2) probability of winning, or (3) difficulty of making the choice. This suggests that MDMA does not influence risky choices, as measured by the Roger's task. Instead, participants demonstrated an increase in behavioral adaptation to winning ‐ specifically they were less likely to switch following a winning outcome for experimental options, with increasing plasma MDMA concentration. We hypothesized that this change in reward‐driven behavior was either a consequence of a change in reward‐related learning rate, in the positive reward prediction error, or in unexpected uncertainty (stemming from outcomes that violate top‐down expectations). To test these hypotheses, we focused our analysis on regions known to process learning rates (amygdala, cuneus), reward prediction errors (ventral striatum), and unexpected uncertainty (posterior cingulate cortex or PCC, middle temporal cortex, insula, hippocampus). We found a main effect of MDMA on feedback‐related activity within the PCC, hippocampus, and insula, but not in other regions of interest. Critically, a regression analysis revealed that the activity in the PCC explained MDMA effects on win‐switch behavior. Finally, we examined functional connectivity between the PCC and reward ‐ related regions, and found that MDMA administration influences the connectivity between the PCC and the caudate, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices.

The results of clinical studies addressing MDMA's serotonin neurotoxic potential in humans have been inconclusive. In the present study, 23 abstinent MDMA users and 19 non-MDMA controls underwent quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, first- and second-generation serotonin transporter (SERT) ligands previously validated in baboons for detecting MDMA-induced brain serotonin neurotoxicity. Global and regional distribution volumes (DVs) and two additional SERT-binding parameters (DV(spec) and DVR) were compared in the two subject populations using parametric statistical analyses. Data from PET studies revealed excellent correlations between the various binding parameters of [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, both in individual brain regions and individual subjects. Global SERT reductions were found in MDMA users with both PET ligands, using all three of the above-mentioned SERT-binding parameters. Preplanned comparisons in 15 regions of interest demonstrated reductions in selected cortical and subcortical structures. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested that SERT measures recover with time, and that loss of the SERT is directly associated with MDMA use intensity.

Acute MDMA treatment produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction associated with MDMA plasma concentrations. Although total leukocyte count remained unchanged, there was a decrease in the CD4 T/CD8 T-cell ratio as well as in the percentage of mature T lymphocytes, probably because of a decrease in both the percentage and absolute number of T helper cells. The decrease in CD4 T-cell counts and in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation was dose-dependent.

The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jpsychires.2014.07.027", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25169854/", "secondary_title": "J Psychiatr Res", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

A substantial proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment; e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always efficacious. Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high‐affinity antagonist of the NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and μ‐opioid receptors. During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6‐8]. These trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub‐anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post‐ketamine infusion [9, 10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration of improvement. D‐cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA‐R glycine site, with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS dosages, such as 50‐500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher dosages (500‐1000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA‐R function, similarly to ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we reason that DCS post‐ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients when compared to placebo. Study Design 2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS≥25%) after 6 ketamine infusions, ketamine administration (weeks 1‐3: days 1‐21) will be stopped and patients will start receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the following manner: 1. Week 4: Days 22‐24 ‐ 250mg/d, one pill per day Well‐being assessment and adverse effect evaluation before drug elevation. 2. Mid‐week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25‐42 ‐ 500mg/d, two pills per day 3. Week 7: Day 43‐49 ‐ 750mg/d, three pills per day 4. Weeks 8‐11: Days 50‐77 ‐ 1000mg/d four pills per day 3. Pyridoxine 200‐300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the study. 4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study. 1. Patients will undergo 6 ketamine infusions within a 3‐week period. Intravenous ketamine will be administrated by a senior anesthesiologist and under the supervision of a senior psychiatrist hence ensuring patient safety. We believe that sub‐anesthetic ketamine infusion will be safer and will cause fewer side effects than ECT. The procedure will be explained in detail to each patient, and written consent will be obtained. After a psychiatric and medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist and a senior anesthesiologist, patients will be given ketamine nfusion added on to their antidepressant therapy. A slow ketamine infusion of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes will be given to the patients. Patients will be monitored by the experienced staff which includes a senior anesthesiologist and a nurse as well as a psychiatrist who will be available nearby. All patients will be monitored continuously for heart rate and rhythm and oxygen saturation, and blood pressure will be measured at 10 minutes intervals. Heart rate variability will be measured and analyzed after ketamine treatment. Measurements will be performed during the ketamine infusion at baseline, after 3 and 6 treatments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS). In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale (CGI‐S) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI‐I) will be performed 2 hours after treatment. In many cases, patients with depression also suffer from alexithymia: inappropriate identification of emotions. Alexithymia will be measured at baseline after 3 and 6 treatments. Ketamine infusion will be stopped in cases of a 20% or above increase in blood pressure or in heart rate over baseline values and/ or an acute dissociative state. Patients will be discharged to their homes at least three hours from end of infusion. Due to the potential effect of ketamine each patient will need to be escorted to and from the hospital by a family member or a friend.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02772211", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

A substantial proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment; e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always efficacious. Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high‐affinity antagonist of the NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and μ‐opioid receptors. During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6‐8]. These trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub‐anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post‐ketamine infusion [9, 10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration of improvement. D‐cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA‐R glycine site, with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS dosages, such as 50‐500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher dosages (500‐1000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA‐R function, similarly to ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we reason that DCS post‐ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients when compared to placebo. Study Design 2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS≥25%) after 6 ketamine infusions, ketamine administration (weeks 1‐3: days 1‐21) will be stopped and patients will start receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the following manner: 1. Week 4: Days 22‐24 ‐ 250mg/d, one pill per day Well‐being assessment and adverse effect evaluation before drug elevation. 2. Mid‐week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25‐42 ‐ 500mg/d, two pills per day 3. Week 7: Day 43‐49 ‐ 750mg/d, three pills per day 4. Weeks 8‐11: Days 50‐77 ‐ 1000mg/d four pills per day 3. Pyridoxine 200‐300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the study. 4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study. 1.

Using structural equation modeling we found that experience with classic psychedelics uniquely predicted self-reported engagement in pro-environmental behaviors, and that this relationship was statistically explained by people's degree of self-identification with nature. Our model controlled for experiences with other classes of psychoactive substances (cannabis, dissociatives, empathogens, popular legal drugs) as well as common personality traits that usually predict drug consumption and/or nature relatedness (openness to experience, conscientiousness, conservatism). Although correlational in nature, results suggest that lifetime experience with psychedelics in particular may indeed contribute to people's pro-environmental behavior by changing their self-construal in terms of an incorporation of the natural world, regardless of core personality traits or general propensity to consume mind-altering substances. Thereby, the present research adds to the contemporary literature on the beneficial effects of psychedelic substance use on mental wellbeing, hinting at a novel area for future research investigating their potentially positive effects on a societal level.

However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports.

This study used magnetoencephalographic gamma power as a surrogate marker for population-level excitation-inhibition balance to explore the underlying neurobiology of SI and depression. In addition, effects of pharmacological intervention with ketamine, which has been shown to rapidly reduce SI and depression, were assessed. METHODS: Data were obtained from 29 drug-free patients with major depressive disorder who participated in an experiment comparing subanesthetic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a placebo saline infusion. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected at baseline and after ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, patients rested with their eyes closed. SI and depression were assessed, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to identify brain regions where gamma power and both SI and depression were associated. Two regions of the salience network (anterior insula, anterior cingulate) were then probed using dynamic causal modeling to test for ketamine effects. RESULTS: Clinically, patients showed significantly reduced SI and depression after ketamine administration. In addition, distinct regions in the anterior insula were found to be associated with SI compared with depression. In modeling of insula-anterior cingulate connectivity, ketamine lowered the membrane capacitance for superficial pyramidal cells. Finally, connectivity between the insula and anterior cingulate was associated with improvements in depression symptoms.

So far, the most convincing evidence for neurotoxicity-related functional deficits in humans derives from neurocognitive studies demonstrating dose-related long-term learning and memory problems in ecstasy users. In our study we used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and a working memory task to investigate cerebral activation in eleven heavy, but currently abstinent MDMA users and two equally sized groups of moderate users and non-users. There were no significant group differences in working memory performance and no differences in cortical activation patterns for a conservative level of significance. However, for a more liberal statistical criterion, both user groups showed stronger activations than controls in right parietal cortex.

As the use of psilocybin expands, it is becoming more important to understand whether psilocybin's psychedelic effects are required for psilocybin's antidepressant effects. Psilocybin's psychedelic effects are known to be dependent on serotonin 2A receptor (5‐HT2AR) activation.

METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons.

There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons.

{"record_id": 6050, "keywords": "['Ketamine']", "text": "Cognitive Biases Under Ketamine.^\nKetamine is a non‐competitive glutamate NMDA antagonist. The infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine results in sub‐clinical schizophrenia‐like positive symptoms in healthy controls. The safety of ketamine use is attested by its daily use in child anesthesia and by a number of studies showing there is no medical, neural or cognitive complication after a single infusion. Low dose ketamine is therefore a valid and safe human model to study psychosis. The objective of the study is to characterise cognitive biases resulting from low dose ketamine infusion, used as a pharmacological model of psychosis. We designed four distinct paradigms designed to better characterize these biases. P1 is a neuroeconomic task where subjects have to make binary choices to maximize gains, in a situation where either direct feedback information or additional counterfactual information is provided. P2 is a neuroeconomic task where a direct manipulation of uncertainty is performed, and its impact on decision is measured. P3 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to classify a gabor orientation into the diagonal or cardinal category based on a rapidly presented series of individual gabors. The contribution of each piece of evidence to the final decision is measured and correlated to fluctuations in eeg data. P4 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to determine the global orientation of a series of sequentially presented gabor stimulus. There are interim responses and final responses, the influence of the former on the latter (confirmation bias) is studied. Our assumption is that low dose ketamine results in reasoning biases by impairing the way uncertainty is monitored and taken into account for decision making. The study design is as follows : randomized, double blind, controlled, against placebo, cross‐over. Healthy subjects will therefore be randomized to receive on the first visit either a ketamine infusion or a placebo infusion. The alternative condition will be applied on the second visit. Ketamine will be prepared using KETAMINE PANPHARMA 250 mg/5mL, and infusion will be. This procedure should produce ketamine plasmatic levels of 140ng/ml. Two blood samples will be taken 30 and 90 minutes after infusion start to record actual ketamine plasmatic levels. Placebo infusion will follow the same pattern of infusion, prepared using CHLORURE DE SODIUM 0,9% MACOPHARMA. We will record both behavioral, electrophysiologic and psychometric data. Detailed assumptions are as folllows : Behavioral data : P1 and 2 : Significant impairment with ketamine in the ability to take into account uncertainty to guide decisions. P3 : Significant decrease with ketamine in the ability to classify correctly the mean spatial orientation of stimuli according to the cardinal or diagonal direction. P4 : Significant increase with ketamine in the confirmation bias following the interim choice. Electroencephalographic data : Correlation between the impairment in the ability to take into account uncertainty and the alteration of the Error Related Negativity and late inhibitory eeg signals, and decreased long distance synchrony as indicated by spectral analysis (P1 and 2). The covariation of brain activity with the weight each stimuli sample will have in the final decision, will be increased as a result of ketamine infusion (P3). Psychometric data : Increase in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) as a result of ketamine infusion. The BPRS scale records the psychotic symtoms and is translated and validated in a french population sample.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02235012", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

{"record_id": 6050, "keywords": "['Ketamine']", "text": "Cognitive Biases Under Ketamine.^\nKetamine is a non‐competitive glutamate NMDA antagonist. The infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine results in sub‐clinical schizophrenia‐like positive symptoms in healthy controls. The safety of ketamine use is attested by its daily use in child anesthesia and by a number of studies showing there is no medical, neural or cognitive complication after a single infusion. Low dose ketamine is therefore a valid and safe human model to study psychosis. The objective of the study is to characterise cognitive biases resulting from low dose ketamine infusion, used as a pharmacological model of psychosis. We designed four distinct paradigms designed to better characterize these biases. P1 is a neuroeconomic task where subjects have to make binary choices to maximize gains, in a situation where either direct feedback information or additional counterfactual information is provided. P2 is a neuroeconomic task where a direct manipulation of uncertainty is performed, and its impact on decision is measured. P3 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to classify a gabor orientation into the diagonal or cardinal category based on a rapidly presented series of individual gabors. The contribution of each piece of evidence to the final decision is measured and correlated to fluctuations in eeg data. P4 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to determine the global orientation of a series of sequentially presented gabor stimulus. There are interim responses and final responses, the influence of the former on the latter (confirmation bias) is studied.

Methods: A four‐way, placebo‐controlled, crossover study in healthy volunteers compared i.v. infusion of AZD6765 (75 and 150 mg) with an antidepressant dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Baseline and post‐drug EEGs were obtained under controlled conditions and composite brain EEG maps were analyzed using Standard Decision Tree methods. Changes in gamma (35‐55 Hz) band power served as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included Clinician Administered Dissociative Status Scale (CADSS), electronystagmography, and pupil size. Results: Significant increases in gamma‐band EEG were observed at 1 hour for ketamine and AZD6765, and baseline‐corrected gammaband EEG following AZD6765 150 mg was statistically indistinguishable from that observed following ketamine. In contrast, AZD6765 caused no dissociative symptoms, whereas ketamine produced a moderate yet significant increase in CADSS and was associated with an increase in supine systolic blood pressure. No significant changes in nystagmus or pupil size were observed with AZD6765. Conclusion: Consistent with preclinical findings, this study supports the utility of gamma‐band EEG as a biomarker for NMDA channel blockade and provides evidence that differentiates ketamine from AZD6765 across multiple tolerability endpoints including cardiovascular and psychotomimetic liability. AZD6765 demonstrated NMDA channel blockade and an improved tolerability profile compared to ketamine.", "doi": "10.1017/S1461145712000508", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38630272/", "secondary_title": "International journal of neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Methods: While controlling for socio-demographic covariates and the use of other substances, the relationship between classic psychedelic use and past year opioid use disorders was analyzed within 44,000 illicit opioid users who completed the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 to 2013. Results: Among respondents with a history of illicit opioid use, psychedelic drug use is associated with 27% reduced risk of past year opioid dependence (weighted risk ratio = 0.73 (0.60-0.89) p = 0.002) and 40% reduced risk of past year opioid abuse (weighted risk ratio = 0.60 (0.41-0.86) p = 0.006). Other than marijuana use, which was associated with 55% reduced risk of past year opioid abuse (weighted risk ratio = 0.45 (0.30-0.66) p < 0.001), no other illicit drug was associated with reduced risk of past year opioid dependence or abuse. Conclusion: Experience with psychedelic drugs is associated with decreased risk of opioid abuse and dependence. Conversely, other illicit drug use history is largely associated with increased risk of opioid abuse and dependence. These findings suggest that psychedelics are associated with positive psychological characteristics and are consistent with prior reports suggesting efficacy in treatment of substance use disorders.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881117691453", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28196428/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

In the first sentence of the Background section, ‘agonist’ should have been ‘antagonist’. This has now been corrected in both the online PDF and HTML versions of this article. The authors apologise for this error. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-17848-001[/rid]). Background: In the past two decades, subanaesthetic doses of ketamine have been demonstrated to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, and accumulating research has demonstrated ketamine's therapeutic effects for a range of psychiatric conditions. Aims: In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. Method: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. Results: We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. Conclusions: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further.

RESULTS: Over the four drug administration sessions, repeated microdoses of LSD elicited dose‐dependent subjective “drug feel” effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05) and stimulant‐like effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05). LSD also acutely decreased negative mood during a simulated social rejection task (26 μg vs placebo, P < 0.05). Overall, the drug produced minimal effects on physiological, cognitive, and most other mood‐related measures. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to low doses of LSD have minimal effects on overall mood and cognitive performance in healthy adults.

Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing improves cognitive functioning and mood. However, few controlled studies have examined the effects of exposure to repeated microdoses in humans. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of repeated low doses of LSD on mood, cognition, and subjective experiences in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 received four sublingual doses of placebo (n = 18), 13 μg (n = 19), or 26 μg (n = 19) of LSD administered every 3 to 4 days. Physiological, subjective, mood, and cognitive outcome measures were collected over five in‐laboratory sessions. Acute effects were examined during the first and fourth drug administration sessions, and lasting effects of LSD were examined during the fifth drug‐free session.

We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment resistant depression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients who presented with clinically significant SI across a trans‐diagnostic sample (n=24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. Suicidal ideation measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 hours post‐treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary analyses included the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale‐Suicidal Ideation (MADRS‐SI) score at 24 hours and additional measures beyond the 24‐hour time point. Results: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7‐day assessment period.

Previous research in naturalistic settings has suggested that ingestion of ayahuasca can improve mental health and well-being; however, these studies were not placebo controlled and did not control for the possibility of expectation bias. This naturalistic observational study was designed to assess whether mental health changes were produced by ayahuasca or by set and setting. Assessments were made pre- and post-ayahuasca sessions in 30 experienced participants of ayahuasca retreats hosted in the Netherlands, Spain, and Germany. Participants consumed ayahuasca (N = 14) or placebo (N = 16). Analysis revealed a main effect of time on symptoms of depression, anxiety, and stress. Compared to baseline, symptoms reduced in both groups after the ceremony, independent of treatment. There was a main treatment × time interaction on implicit emotional empathy, indicating that ayahuasca increased emotional empathy to negative stimuli. The current findings suggest that improvements in mental health of participants of ayahuasca ceremonies can be driven by non-pharmacological factors that constitute a placebo response but also by pharmacological factors that are related to the use of ayahuasca.

The authors' previous proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial of single-dose intravenous ketamine infusion in individuals with PTSD showed significant and rapid PTSD symptom reduction 24 hours postinfusion. The present study is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for the treatment of chronic PTSD. METHODS: Individuals with chronic PTSD (N=30) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive six infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) (psychoactive placebo control) over 2 consecutive weeks. Clinician-rated and self-report assessments were administered 24 hours after the first infusion and at weekly visits. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), from baseline to 2 weeks (after completion of all infusions). Secondary outcome measures included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and side effect measures. RESULTS: The ketamine group showed a significantly greater improvement in CAPS-5 and MADRS total scores than the midazolam group from baseline to week 2. At week 2, the mean CAPS-5 total score was 11.88 points (SE=3.96) lower in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group (d=1.13, 95% CI=0.36, 1.91). Sixty-seven percent of participants in the ketamine group were treatment responders, compared with 20% in the midazolam group. Among ketamine responders, the median time to loss of response was 27.5 days following the 2-week course of infusions. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated overall, without serious adverse events.

They also have the remarkable property of producing persisting positive psychological changes in healthy volunteers for at least several months. In this study (NCT03289949), 35 medium-high doses of psilocybin were administered to 28 healthy volunteers (12 females). By the end of the dosing day, participants reported the intensity of their acute experience using the 30-item Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) and an open-form qualitative report from home. Persisting psychological effects attributed to the psilocybin experience were measured using the Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ) 3-months after administration. Using a linear latent-variable model we show that the MEQ total score is positively associated with the later emergence of positive PEQ effects (p = 3 × 10(-5)).

Methylphenidate mainly enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas MDMA mainly increases brain serotonin levels. Additionally, both drugs increase noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore have also psychostimulant properties. It is well recognized that psychoactive substances affect sexual perception and behavior. Typically, dopaminergic psychostimulants including methamphetamine and cocaine are reported to enhance sexual drive and to increase sexual pleasure. In contrast, serotonergic drugs such as serotonin uptake inhibitors typically impair sexual arousal and functions (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty reaching orgasm). However, ecstasy users describe inconsistent effects on sexual desire and performance. Some users report feelings of emotional closeness while consuming Ecstasy but no desire for penetrative sex.

In the last decade, it has been suggested that subdissociative-dose ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. We aimed to investigate the efficacy of low-dose ketamine administered during caesarean section in preventing postpartum depression. METHODS: Using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, 330 parturients who were scheduled to undergo caesarean section were enrolled in this trial. The parturients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25 mg/kg diluted to 10 mL with 0.9% saline) or placebo (10 mL of 0.9% saline) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of depression, which was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) (a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numeric rating scale score of pain at 3 day and 6 week postpartum. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the prevalence of postpartum depression between the two groups at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery.

Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls.

The primary clinical outcome is change in score of the objectively‐rated 24‐item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD‐24). Standard criteria for; depression severity, treatment response, remission and relapse will be used (please see definitions in \"assessments\") in a three‐month follow‐up schedule which involves the HRSD‐24 and other instruments at weeks 6 and 12 post‐final infusion. Safety and tolerability outcomes consist of psychotomimetic, dissociative, cognitive and physical health effects of repeated ketamine infusions, measured before, during and after infusions using a range of validated instruments.; Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: Participants will be assessed at baseline (on admission to hospital), and on a weekly basis using the primary clinical outcome, the HRSD‐24. Those who are eligible for the study, will be invited to be randomised to a four‐week course of once‐weekly ketamine vs. midazolam infusions. The HRSD‐24 will be assessed at each infusion session and at weeks 6 and 12. Cognitive outcomes will be assessed following randomization and repeated at week 12. Tolerability outcomes e.g. the Young Mania Rating Scale, Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale etc, will be assessed before, during; and after each infusion session. In total, follow‐up will take place over three months.; INCLUSION CRITERIA: • =18 years old • Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression‐24 item version (HRSD‐24) score of =21 • Voluntary admission for treatment of an acute depressive episode • Meet DSM‐IV criteria for a major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar affective disorder (current episode depression) Are the trial subjects under 18? no Number of subjects for this age range: F.1.2 Adults (18‐64 years) yes F.1.2.1 Number of subjects for this age range 30 F.1.3 Elderly (>=65 years) yes F.1.3.1 Number of subjects for this age range 10 PRIMARY OUTCOME: Main Objective: The aim of this trial is to assess ketamine as an adjunctive therapy in major depression. We hypothesise that ketamine will accelerate the recovery time in those patients who have been admitted to hospital with a depressive episode. Primary end point(s): The focus of a pilot trial’s outcomes is on trial process with assessment of the primary clinical outcome being secondary because the pilot itself is not designed to measure efficacy. Process outcomes that will inform a future definitive trial incluse the following:; • recruitment methods and rate; • willingness of participants to be randomised; • willingness of participants to complete assessments; • randomisation; • success of blinding; • ability to administer a course of ketamine infusions; • medical safety and acceptability of ketamine infusions; • rates of adverse dissociative and psychiatric events; • adherence to allocated treatment; • adherence to follow up; • reasons for drop‐out from treatment; • reasons for drop‐out from follow‐up; • establish a 95% confidence interval for the differences between the ketamine and midazolam groups during the 4‐week treatment phase t help with power calculations for a future definitive trial ; Secondary Objective: 1. To assess the safety and tolerability of repeated (x4) infusions of ketamine vs. midazolam in this patient population. ; 2. To explore the role of ketamine‐induced changes in peripheral blood neuroplasticity molecules for: (i) monitoring biological response to ketamine during the first infusion and (ii) for evaluating this biological response in treating depression. ; 3. To investigate epigenetic modulation of depression/stress‐related genes in patients being treated with ketamine.; Timepoint(s) of evaluation of this end point: The primary endpoint of this pilot trial is successful completion of the trial protocol. Process outcomes such as recruitment and retention rates are the primary focus. Recruitment will cease when 40 participants have been randomised.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://trialsearch.who.int/Trial2.aspx?TrialID=EUCTR2016-004764-18-IE", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

MATERIAL AND METHODS This randomized, double-blind, controlled study included 417 cervical carcinoma patients who received laparoscopic modified radical hysterectomy from April 2015 to July 2018 and who also had mild/moderate depression symptoms based on HAMD-17 scores (8~24). All patients were randomized into 4 groups: 1) the control group, 2) the racemic ketamine group, 3) the high-dose S-ketamine group; and 4) the low-dose S-ketamine group. Pain was assessed using the Visual Analogue Score (VAS), and depression was assessed using theHAMD-17 score. Serum levels of BDNF and 5-HT were measured. RESULTS The 4 groups of patients showed no significant differences in operation time, bleeding volume, hospitalization duration, or complications.

METHODS/PROCEDURES: Across both ASPIRE studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133), patients (N = 456) were randomized to esketamine 84 mg or placebo nasal spray twice weekly for 4 weeks plus comprehensive standard of care, including hospitalization and newly initiated or optimized antidepressant(s). In post hoc analyses of pooled data, changes from baseline at 24 hours after the first dose in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised, in the full cohort and in subgroups, were analyzed using analysis of covariance. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Esketamine plus standard of care demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score versus placebo plus standard of care at 24 hours (least square mean difference [95% confidence interval], -3.8 [-5.75 to -1.89]) and at earlier (4 hours: -3.4 [-5.05 to -1.71]) and later time points (day 25: -3.4 [-5.36 to -1.36]). The between-group difference (95% confidence interval) for change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised at 24 hours was -0.20 (-0.43 to 0.04) for all patients and -0.31 (-0.61 to -0.01) for those with a history of suicide attempt.

Many patients remain refractory to treatment in many symptom domains, notably with cognitive deficits.

Methods: In a preliminary, randomized waitlist‐controlled trial, 21 patients who were diagnosed with MDD (15 F, 6 M; mean age = 40.3 [range = 20‐59]) were randomized using Urn randomization to either immediate (N = 12) or delayed (N = 9) treatment consisting of two psilocybin administration sessions (20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg). Three weeks before session 1, and 1 and 4 weeks after session 2, a subset of patients (N = 18) completed behavioral measures of cognitive flexibility (the Penn Conditional Exclusion Task, or PCET) and verbal reasoning (the Penn Verbal Learning Test).

Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans.

Background: MDMA has been shown to induce feelings of sociability, a positive emotional bias and enhanced empathy. While previous research has used only visual emotional stimuli, communication entails more than that single dimension and it is known that auditory information is also crucial in this process. In addition, it is, however, unclear what the neurobiological mechanism underlying these MDMA effects on social behaviour is.

Aim: The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on processing of sounds (Processing of Affective Sounds Task (PAST)) and cognitive biases (Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)) towards emotional and social stimuli and the role of 5-HT2A receptor in these effects. Methods: Twenty healthy recreational users entered a 2 × 2, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with ketanserin (40 mg) as pre-treatment and MDMA (75 mg) as treatment. Behavioural (PAST, AAT) measures were conducted 90 min after treatment with MDMA, respectively, 120 min after ketanserin. Self-report mood measures and oxytocin concentrations were taken at baseline and before and after behavioural tests. Results: Findings showed that MDMA reduced arousal elicited by negative sounds. This effect was counteracted by ketanserin pre-treatment, indicating involvement of the 5-HT₂ receptor in this process. MDMA did not seem to induce a bias towards emotional and social stimuli. It increased positive and negative mood ratings and elevated oxytocin plasma concentrations. The reduction in arousal levels when listening to negative sounds was not related to the elevated subjective arousal. Conclusion: It is suggested that this decrease in arousal to negative stimuli reflects potentially a lowering of defences, a process that might play a role in the therapeutic process.

Results: Out of 9233 past year magic mushroom users, 19 (0.2%) reported having sought emergency medical treatment, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.06%. Young age was the only predictor associated with higher risk of emergency medical presentations. The most common symptoms were psychological, namely anxiety/panic and paranoia/suspiciousness. Poor ‘mindset’, poor ‘setting’ and mixing substances were most reported reasons for incidents. All but one respondent returned back to normality within 24 h.

It has been suggested that chronic ketamine may also mimic aspects of this disorder, in particular impaired cognitive function. As semantic processing deficits are considered central to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, this study aimed to characterize semantic impairments following both acute and chronic ketamine. METHODS: We examined the acute effects of two doses of ketamine (Experiment 1) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, independent group design with 48 volunteers. Ketamine's chronic effects (Experiment 2) were explored in 16 ketamine users and 16 poly-drug controls.

This study sought to establish whether ketamine given peri‐operatively could reduce persistent post‐surgical pain. Trial design: Double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial comparing low-dose intravenous ketamine and saline placebo. Methods: Seventy patients undergoing thoracotomy were randomized to receive either intravenous ketamine (0.1 mg kg−1 hr−1) or saline placebo for 96 hr, starting 10 min prior to surgery. A bolus dose of 0.1 mg/kg of ketamine/placebo was given prior to starting the infusion. Post‐operative analgesia consisted of either an epidural infusion or patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA), +/− a paravertebral infusion of local anaesthetic.

RESULTS. The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data, duration of operation, applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation. The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild, in contrast to the control group. Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups.

As subjective feelings negative criteria were mainly reported in the control group, where as in all test groups positive sensations dominated. Dreams were reported mostly after the higher dosage of ketamine, but no patient experienced any unpleasant dreams. The clinical assessment of the different regimes were excellent for test groups P/M and K50/M, modest for the control group and test group K25/M. Postoperatively, patients of test group P/M were remarkably sedated, but no clinically relevant sedation or motor weakness were observed in the other groups. Postoperative pain sensations were rated more intense in all test groups than in the control group. In test groups P/M and K25/M an increasing pain level was recorded during the postoperative period, with the consequence of a higher demand rate for analgesics. CONCLUSIONS. Dental surgery can be performed safely with low-dose ketamine/midazolam. Compared to pentazocine/midazolam, the higher dosage of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg bw) showed identical results intraoperatively, but was superior during the postoperative period (vigilance), and thus may represent a suitable dosage. The lower dosage of ketamine resulted in worse operating conditions, but a dosage higher than 0.5 mg/kg bw might lead to unconscious sedation and might increase the frequency of unpleasant dreams.", "doi": "10.1007/s001010050190", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/7573905/", "secondary_title": "Anaesthesist", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

{"record_id": 6148, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Suicidal Ideation']", "text": "A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Music for Suicidal Ideation.^\nKetamine is a glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions have been well‐tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, most notably in subjects with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) and treatment‐resistant bipolar depression. Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount. Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a chief complaint. Research Aims. Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined: ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes with one hour of pre‐planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine, and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4‐week follow up interval, subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI and quality of life. A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental, relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant depression. Music can be previewed at the link below: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVbGPBkXJYHF Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment. Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be administering the sub‐anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen‐minute intervals during the infusion, and will be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals. Subjects will be followed up by phone at weekly intervals and voluntary hospitalization will be recommended for patients with SSI score of ≥4. Psychotropic medications w ll be adjusted and optimized at the discretion of the treating physicians at study entry. Medications may be modified during the 4‐week study interval in line with standard practice. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Informed consent will be obtained in person when possible or by the Teams telemedicine app when necessary if research staff is unavailable on site. The primary outcome measure of this study will be treatment response, defined as a ≥50% score reduction in the SSI from baseline to 4 weeks after the first ketamine injection. Remission will be defined as a ≥50% reduction in SSI score with score ≤4. The SSI will be administered at baseline, prior to each treatment and 24 hours after IV ketamine administration, then every week during the symptom monitoring follow‐up period of 4 weeks. The clinician‐rated SSI assesses current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). Medications may be adjusted during the study interval. Secondary outcome will be change in MADRS and SSI score from baseline to 4 weeks after the treatment. Raters will be blinded to the subject treatment group. During the 4‐week follow up participants will be contacted by phone with follow‐up questions regarding their overall health status, mood and clinical state using MADRS, SSI, QIDS and other clinical scales listed below. Study/Design. Patients with clinically documented depression with SI will be screened for diagnosis of depressive episode with the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a structured interview of psychiatric disorders, at baseline to establish the presence of a major depressive episode. The depressive episode could be associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or substance induced depressive disorder. Procedure Portable speakers will be provided playing relaxing music prior to and during the administration of ketamine for groups 2 and 3 (Nils Frahm playlist‐modern classical composer). This music has been previously used at Christus Mother Francis for therapeutic ketamine use with good results. Subjects will be inform that music can be stopped by request at any time. Informed consent and screening will be performed in the UTHET north campus clinical trials staff at initial presentation. Follow up assessments during weeks 1‐4 will be done by phone. Clinical research staff will randomize subjects to treatment groups as documented above. Ketamine IV will be supplied by the UT Health East Texas pharmacy. The administration of ketamine will be initiated by the emergency room nurse with ACLS certified physician supervision. Prior to the treatment, patients will be undergo psychiatric interview by the University of Texas Health center at Tyler psychiatric ER consult liaison team as per standard practice. An ACLS certified physician will be nearby in the ER post‐procedure for 1 hour or until a clinician deems patient is clinically stable. We plan on utilizing the monitoring protocol advised by the American Psychiatric Association consensus statement: \"(1) assessment of respiratory status (i.e., oxygen saturation or end‐tidal CO2); (2) assessment of cardiovascular function (blood pressure and heart rate, reported on a regular basis every 15 minutes); (3) assessment of the level of consciousness or other documented assessment of responsiveness; and (4) delineation of criteria for stopping the infusion and a clear plan for managing cardiovascular or behavioral events during treatment.\" Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. The most common side effects associated with ketamine are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, double vision, drowsiness, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, dissociation (feeling strange and disconnected from the world), and confusion. Delirium, hallucinations, and nightmares have been associated with high dose ketamine, but are not common side effects in subanesthetic ketamine treatment. The subanesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg has been documented to be safe and we l tolerated in numerous clinical trials in the treatment of suicidal thoughts. Rare but serious possible adverse event associated with ketamine include: Cardiac arrest, diabetes insipidus, anaphylaxis, ocular hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, arrythmia exacerbation or apnea. Digital pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored throughout the injection at 15 minute intervals with a recovery period similar to recent study of IV ketamine for PTSD and TRD performed at the Minneapolis VA. Vital signs, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) will be assessed pre‐dose, at 40 minutes after ketamine infusion has started. Hypertensive emergency, respiratory failure or cardiac arrest is not known to have occurred in previous clinical trials of IV ketamine for treatment of depression. Emergency room physicians will be notified and render care in the event of unexpected medical emergencies. The infusions will be stopped if a patient requests stopping the infusion, becomes agitated, or goes into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Medical emergencies will be managed by ACLS certified ER physicians. Code BERT will be called as necessary if a patient becomes acutely agitated and presents a danger to themselves or others. Medications will be optimized as per standard practice throughout the 4‐week study. Suicide safety plans, referrals to outpatient treatments will done as per standard practice. Participants will be directed to contact the nearest ER in case of emergency after initial hospital discharge. Participants will be contacted weekly during the 4‐week study period to review the patient's health status and administer clinical scales by phone. Clinical assessment. Informed consent will be obtained. This evaluation will obtain family history and demographic data. We will perform a urine drug screening (UDS) to rule out recent undisclosed use of illicit substances that may exclude subjects from the study. Demographic information is obtained through a standardized form and covers age, race, gender, education (information both on siblings and their parents), religion, and socioeconomic status. Participants will fill out the mood questionnaires rating the severity of the clinical symptoms. Participants will be asked about previous medications they have taken for mental health disorders and general medical conditions. Results will be stored in a secure location by the department of clinical research. Selected mood assessment questionnaires will be administered by our clinical research staff including the MINI Interview. This is the standard psychiatric research evaluation for ascertainment of psychiatric diagnosis in the context of research studies. It is a comprehensive structured interview for determining axis I diagnosis according to the DSM‐V to be administered at study entry and takes approximately 15 minutes. We will also use the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): this scale rates depressive symptoms, and its psychometric properties are well‐established. We will assess SI with the Suicidal Scale Instrument. The clinician‐rated SSI assessed current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). We will also assess dissociation with the Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS): Frequency of administration: After every treatment, to monitor the dissociative side effects status post infusion. Self‐report questionnaires to assess mood, and quality of life will include Quick inventory of depressive symptomatology QIDS‐SR to measure self‐reported depressive symptoms, weekly and the World health organization quality of life scale.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04658420", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

{"record_id": 6148, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Suicidal Ideation']", "text": "A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Music for Suicidal Ideation.^\nKetamine is a glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions have been well‐tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, most notably in subjects with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) and treatment‐resistant bipolar depression. Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount. Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a chief complaint. Research Aims. Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined: ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes with one hour of pre‐planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine, and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4‐week follow up interval, subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI and quality of life. A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental, relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant depression. Music can be previewed at the link below: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVbGPBkXJYHF Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment. Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be administering the sub‐anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen‐minute intervals during the infusion, and will be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals. Subjects will be followed up by phone at weekly intervals and voluntary hospitalization will be recommended for patients with SSI score of ≥4. Psychotropic medications w ll be adjusted and optimized at the discretion of the treating physicians at study entry. Medications may be modified during the 4‐week study interval in line with standard practice. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Informed consent will be obtained in person when possible or by the Teams telemedicine app when necessary if research staff is unavailable on site. The primary outcome measure of this study will be treatment response, defined as a ≥50% score reduction in the SSI from baseline to 4 weeks after the first ketamine injection. Remission will be defined as a ≥50% reduction in SSI score with score ≤4. The SSI will be administered at baseline, prior to each treatment and 24 hours after IV ketamine administration, then every week during the symptom monitoring follow‐up period of 4 weeks. The clinician‐rated SSI assesses current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). Medications may be adjusted during the study interval. Secondary outcome will be change in MADRS and SSI score from baseline to 4 weeks after the treatment. Raters will be blinded to the subject treatment group. During the 4‐week follow up participants will be contacted by phone with follow‐up questions regarding their overall health status, mood and clinical state using MADRS, SSI, QIDS and other clinical scales listed below. Study/Design. Patients with clinically documented depression with SI will be screened for diagnosis of depressive episode with the Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a structured interview of psychiatric disorders, at baseline to establish the presence of a major depressive episode. The depressive episode could be associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or substance induced depressive disorder. Procedure Portable speakers will be provided playing relaxing music prior to and during the administration of ketamine for groups 2 and 3 (Nils Frahm playlist‐modern classical composer). This music has been previously used at Christus Mother Francis for therapeutic ketamine use with good results. Subjects will be inform that music can be stopped by request at any time. Informed consent and screening will be performed in the UTHET north campus clinical trials staff at initial presentation. Follow up assessments during weeks 1‐4 will be done by phone. Clinical research staff will randomize subjects to treatment groups as documented above. Ketamine IV will be supplied by the UT Health East Texas pharmacy. The administration of ketamine will be initiated by the emergency room nurse with ACLS certified physician supervision. Prior to the treatment, patients will be undergo psychiatric interview by the University of Texas Health center at Tyler psychiatric ER consult liaison team as per standard practice. An ACLS certified physician will be nearby in the ER post‐procedure for 1 hour or until a clinician deems patient is clinically stable. We plan on utilizing the monitoring protocol advised by the American Psychiatric Association consensus statement: \"(1) assessment of respiratory status (i.e., oxygen saturation or end‐tidal CO2); (2) assessment of cardiovascular function (blood pressure and heart rate, reported on a regular basis every 15 minutes); (3) assessment of the level of consciousness or other documented assessment of responsiveness; and (4) delineation of criteria for stopping the infusion and a clear plan for managing cardiovascular or behavioral events during treatment.\" Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. The most common side effects associated with ketamine are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, double vision, drowsiness, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, dissociation (feeling strange and disconnected from the world), and confusion. Delirium, hallucinations, and nightmares have been associated with high dose ketamine, but are not common side effects in subanesthetic ketamine treatment. The subanesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg has been documented to be safe and we l tolerated in numerous clinical trials in the treatment of suicidal thoughts. Rare but serious possible adverse event associated with ketamine include: Cardiac arrest, diabetes insipidus, anaphylaxis, ocular hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, arrythmia exacerbation or apnea. Digital pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored throughout the injection at 15 minute intervals with a recovery period similar to recent study of IV ketamine for PTSD and TRD performed at the Minneapolis VA. Vital signs, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) will be assessed pre‐dose, at 40 minutes after ketamine infusion has started. Hypertensive emergency, respiratory failure or cardiac arrest is not known to have occurred in previous clinical trials of IV ketamine for treatment of depression. Emergency room physicians will be notified and render care in the event of unexpected medical emergencies. The infusions will be stopped if a patient requests stopping the infusion, becomes agitated, or goes into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Medical emergencies will be managed by ACLS certified ER physicians. Code BERT will be called as necessary if a patient becomes acutely agitated and presents a danger to themselves or others. Medications will be optimized as per standard practice throughout the 4‐week study. Suicide safety plans, referrals to outpatient treatments will done as per standard practice.

After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I‐II patients aged 30‐50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 ‐10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16‐gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia.

Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1‐ 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis‐atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg.

The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient‐care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required. Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine 0.01 mg/kg.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02455609", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

LIMITATIONS: The limitations of the present study were its small sample size and the short-term follow-up period.

The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not ketamine administration significantly improves depressive symptomatology in depression and more specifically in major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar depression, resistant depression (non-ECT studies), and as an anesthetic agent in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for resistant depression (ECT studies). Secondary outcomes were the duration of ketamine's effect, the efficacy on suicidal ideations, the existence of a dose effect, and the safety/tolerance of the treatment. METHODS: Studies were included if they met the following criteria (without any language or date restriction): design: randomized controlled trials, intervention: ketamine administration, participants: diagnosis of depression, and evaluation of severity based on a validated scale. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each study. We used fixed and random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We included nine non-ECT studies in our quantitative analysis (192 patients with major depressive disorder and 34 patients with bipolar depression). Overall, depression scores were significantly decreased in the ketamine groups compared to those in the control groups (SMD = -0.99; 95 % CI -1.23, -0.75; p < 0.01). Ketamine's efficacy was confirmed in MDD (resistant to previous pharmacological treatments or not) (SMD = -0.91; 95 % CI -1.19,-0.64; p < 0.01), in bipolar depression (SMD = -1.34; 95 % CI -1.94, -0.75), and in drug-free patients as well as patients under medication. Four ECT trials (118 patients) were included in our quantitative analysis. One hundred and three patients were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 15 with bipolar depression.

Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO.

Psilocybin represents a promising paradigm for unresponsive depression that warrants further research in double-blind randomised control trials.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-017-4771-x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29119217/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

METHODS: Individuals with comorbid DSM-5-defined PTSD and DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (N = 15) received 6 intravenous ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg) on a Monday-Wednesday-Friday schedule over a 12-day period from May 2015 to June 2016. Data from outcome measures were collected before and 24 hours after each infusion and weekly for 8 weeks following the final infusion. RESULTS: Continuous measures of symptom change were significant for both disorders and were associated with large effect sizes (mean decrease in PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score = 33.3 points [95% CI, 23.0-43.5 points], P < .0005, sample size-adjusted Cohen d [d'] = 2.17; mean decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score = 26.6 points [95% CI, 23.0-30.2 points], P < .0005, d' = 4.64). The remission rate for PTSD was 80.0%, and the response rate for TRD was 93.3%. Participants in remission from PTSD after the infusion series (n = 12) had a median time to relapse of 41 days. Similarly, participants whose depression symptoms responded to the infusion series (n = 14) had a median time to relapse of 20 days.

We have recently shown that reduced amygdala activity during threat processing might underlie psilocybin's effect on emotional processing in a block‐design paradigm [1]. In this study, we investigated psilocybin's effects in an event‐related face discrimination task in n = 18 healthy volunteers who received psilocybin and placebo in a crossover design. Face discrimination of emotional faces relies on both prefrontal as well as subcortical structures, namely the amygdala. We hypothesized that the amygdala activity alone or as part of a network is altered during psilocybin application. This could manifest in altered salience of emotional face‐processing in task activity or in task‐related connectivity of the amygdala. Methods: Using a randomized, double‐blind, placebocontrolled, cross‐over design, subjects received either placebo or 0.16 mg/kg oral psilocybin in two separate imaging sessions at least 14 days apart (as reported in [1]). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging, beta‐series connectivity and graphtheory network analysis to characterize effective connectivity during categorization of angry, fearful or happy affective faces in contrast to affective neutral faces in the brain. As the amygdala is a key target for psilocybin's effect during emotion processing, we used the left and right amygdala as α‐priori region‐of‐interest seed masks for the connectivity analysis. Results: Psilocybin (in contrast to placebo) increased reaction time for all three categories of affective stimuli in comparison to neutral stimuli. The rate of correctly recognized hits did not differ between face categories and between placebo and psilocybin. The face discrimination task demonstrated in the placebo condition a robust signal of visual cortex, fusiform cortex, limbic system namely the amygdala, prefrontal and motor cortices. During the face categorization task, there was a tendency for a stronger striatal activation during the angry face condition under psilocybin, but no difference for fearful or happy faces. During psilocybin, a beta‐series connectivity analysis of the left‐amygdala seed ROI showed a decrease in the connectivity with the striatum (mainly left putamen, cluster‐corrected pFDR<0.03). This was not found during the happy or fearful face condition. On a behavioural level, the rate of correct classified angry faces correlated with the coupling between amygdala and putamen. The coupling correlated negatively with the sum score of altered states (TAS: r = 0.57, p = 0.015) and with anxiety (r = 0.51, p = 0.03) during psilocybin intake. Conclusion: In summary, psilocybin alters subcortical limbic networks during processing of angry faces in comparison to neutral faces. During psilocybin, the coupling between amygdala and putamen is decreased. This points to a change in salienceevaluation of angry faces, which is partly supported by the behavioral effect. The stronger coupling between amygdala and putamen during angry face discrimination, the lower the anxiety rating during psilocybin. Therefore, our results support further that psilocybin not only alters amygdala activity but exerts downward effects in the striatum.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}
