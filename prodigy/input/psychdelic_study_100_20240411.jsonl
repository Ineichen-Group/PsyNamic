On treatment day 1, the patient was administered 56 mg of esketamine nasal spray using two nasal spray devices (28 mg per device). Twenty minutes after the first esketamine nasal spray device was administered, the patient experienced a dissociative episode lasting 40 minutes that caused anxiety and confusion. The patient was encouraged to listen to music during treatment sessions, which resulted in notable improvement of her symptoms.

The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for mental health conditions from the present wave of psychedelic research (1990s to present). A total of 43 studies met criteria and were included. The conditions reviewed were substance use disorders; anxiety and/or depression, often associated with terminal illness; posttraumatic stress disorder; and obsessive\u2013compulsive disorder. Quantitative results indicate that psychedelics can significantly reduce clinical outcomes associated with these mental health conditions. Common themes identified from qualitative reports included increased acceptance and processing of emotions, connectedness to others, forgiveness, self-compassion, insights into the self, peak or mystical experiences, ego dissolution, positive changes in worldview, motivation and commitment to change, changes in the relationship to the substance of abuse for those with substance use disorder, and acceptance of death for those with terminal illness. No serious, long-term adverse events were reported directly attributable to drug ingestion. We discuss the strengths and limitations of the research base, along with suggestions for clinical practice, potential therapeutic mechanisms, and directions for future research.

The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine. METHODS: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22). RESULTS: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (F\u2081,\u2082\u2082 = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (F\u2081,\u2084\u2080 = 3.15, P = .08).

Ketamine, originally an anesthetic, has been shown anti-suicide effects in clinical trials designed to treat depression. However, changes at the biochemical level were assessed only in protocols of ketamine with very limited sample sizes, particularly when the subcutaneous route was considered. In addition, the inflammatory changes associated with ketamine effects and their correlation with response to treatment, dose-effect, and suicide risk warrant further investigation. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ketamine results in better control of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in patients with depressive episodes and whether ketamine affects psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here the design of a naturalistic prospective multicenter study protocol of ketamine in depressive episodes carried out at Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Hospital Moinhos de Vento (HMV). The study was planned to recruit adult patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar disorder (BD) types 1 or 2, who are currently in a depressive episode and show symptoms of suicidal ideation and/or behavior according to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and have been prescribed ketamine by their assistant psychiatrist. Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide.

Methods: In this study, depressed patients with clinically significant suicidal ideation (n\u2009=\u200978) underwent neuropsychological testing before and 1 day after double-blind treatment with intravenous ketamine (n\u2009=\u200939) or midazolam (n\u2009=\u200939).

The primary outcome was change in performance on this neurocognitive battery. The study was conducted between November 2012 and January 2017. Results: Blinded ketamine produced rapid improvement in suicidal ideation and mood in comparison to midazolam, as we had reported previously. Ketamine, relative to midazolam, was also associated with specific improvement in reaction time (Choice RT) and interference processing/cognitive control (computerized Stroop task)-the latter a measure that has been associated with past suicide attempt in depression. In midazolam nonremitters later treated with open ketamine and retested, reaction time and interference processing/cognitive control also improved relative to both of their prior assessments. Neurocognitive improvement, however, was not correlated with changes in depression, suicidal thinking, or general mood. Conclusions: Overall, ketamine was found to have a positive therapeutic effect on neurocognition 1 day after treatment on at least 1 measure associated with suicidal behavior in the context of depression.

Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake.

Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-018-5049-7", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30357434/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD.

OBJECTIVES: Here, we evaluated the antidepressant efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with sleep disturbances. METHODS: This study included 127 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who received ketamine treatments during a 12-day period. Sleep quality was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale sleep disturbance factor (SDF) (items 4, 5 and 6). Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was measured at baseline, day 13 and day 26. This study was a post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the HAMD-17 score at 13 post-infusion time points compared to baseline, as well as the scores in SDF score at each of the 7 post-infusion (4\u00a0h after each infusion excluded) time points among all patients. Logistic regression and linear correlation analyses revealed that a greater reduction in the SDF after 24\u00a0h of the first ketamine infusion resulted in a better antidepressant effect in the last two follow-up visits. Moreover, BDNF levels were significantly higher in sleep responders than in non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: In the 127 patients, six ketamine infusions induced better therapeutic effects in sleep responders than in sleep non-responders and patients without sleep disturbances. The sleep response after repeated ketamine infusions was positively associated with high serum BDNF levels. Early sleep disturbance improvement (as early as 24\u00a0h after the first ketamine injection) may predict the antidepressant effect of repeated-dose ketamine.", "doi": "10.1007/s43440-020-00203-1", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33387333/", "secondary_title": "Pharmacol Rep"}

Importantly, it has been suggested that use of MDMA may be neurotoxic particularly for serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) neurons. In the past decades, several molecular imaging studies examined directly in vivo the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study is to review the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems as assessed by molecular imaging studies in small animals, non-human primates and humans. METHODS: A search in PubMed was performed. Eighty-eight articles were found on which inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria; all were focused on the 5-HT or dopamine (DA) system. Importantly, 9 out of 11 of the animal studies that examined the effects of MDMA on 5-HT transporter (SERT) availability showed a significant loss of binding potential. In human studies, this was the case for 14 out of 16 studies, particularly in heavy users. In abstinent users, significant recovery of SERT binding was found over time. Most imaging studies in humans that focused on the DA system did not find any significant effect of ecstasy/MDMA use. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical and clinical molecular imaging studies on the effects of ecstasy/MDMA use/administration on neurotransmitter systems show quite consistent alterations of the 5-HT system. Particularly, in human studies, loss of SERT binding was observed in heavy ecstasy users, which might reflect 5-HT neurotoxicity, although alternative explanations (e.g. down-regulation of the SERT) cannot be excluded.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-016-4396-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568200/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

American and European self-help groups provided public testimonials that ibogaine alleviated drug craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms after only a single dose administration. Preclinical studies in animal models of addiction have provided proof-of-concept evidence in support of these claims. However, the purported therapeutic benefits of ibogaine are based on anecdotal reports from a small series of case reports that used retrospective recruitment procedures. We reviewed clinical results from an open label case series (N = 191) of human volunteers seeking to detoxify from opioids or cocaine with medical monitoring during inpatient treatment. Whole blood was assayed to obtain pharmacokinetic measures to determine the metabolism and clearance of ibogaine. Clinical safety data and adverse events (AEs) were studied in male and female subjects. There were no significant adverse events following administration of ibogaine in a dose range that was shown to be effective for blocking opioid withdrawal symptoms in this study. We used multi-dimensional craving questionnaires during inpatient detoxification to test if ibogaine was effective in diminishing heroin and cocaine cravings. Participants also completed standardized questionnaires about their health and mood before and after ibogaine treatment, and at program discharge. One-month follow-up data were reviewed where available to determine if ibogaine's effects on drug craving would persist outside of an inpatient setting. We report here that ibogaine therapy administered in a safe dose range diminishes opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings. Pharmacological treatments for opioid dependence include detoxification, narcotic antagonists and long-term opioid maintenance therapy.

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS).

The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123I]\u03b2-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects.

However, pharmacological interaction experiments, such as the modulation of one drug response in the presence of another, have not been widely investigated using a task-free ASL approach. Objectives: We assessed the effects of three psychoactive compounds (ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine), and their interaction, on resting brain perfusion in healthy human volunteers. Methods: A multivariate Gaussian process classification (GPC) and more conventional univariate analyses were applied. The four pre-infusion conditions for each subject comprised risperidone, lamotrigine and two placebo sessions. The two placebo conditions enabled us to evaluate the classification performance in a test-retest setting, in addition to its performance in distinguishing the active oral drugs from placebo (direct effect on brain perfusion). The post ketamine- or saline-infusion scans allowed the effect of ketamine, and its interaction with risperidone and lamotrigine, on brain perfusion to be characterised. Results: The pseudo-continuous ASL measurements of perfusion were sensitive to the effects of ketamine infusion and risperidone. The GPC captured consistent changes in perfusion across the group and contextualised the univariate changes with a larger pattern of regions contributing to accurate discrimination of ketamine from placebo.

A limitation of ketamine treatment in TRD is the relatively short duration of time to relapse (e.g., median 2-4\u00a0weeks). The objective of the systematic review herein is to identify strategies capable of prolonging the acute efficacy of ketamine in adults with TRD. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to December 2020 for clinical studies written in English using the following key terms: ketamine, prolong, and depression. A total of 454 articles were identified from the literature search which included all clinical studies regarding prolonging the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Twenty-two articles were included: ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs), eight prospective open-label trials, one retrospective chart review, and three case reports. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data extraction. The primary outcome was prolonged effect, defined as statistically significant antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. RESULTS: A total of 454 articles were identified, and 22 articles were included. Different treatment modalites including pharmacological interventions, manualized-based psychotherapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and intravenous monotherapy were examined to determine their impact on the prolongation of antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. No treatment modality, other than repeat-dose IV ketamine, has demonstrated ability to significantly prolong the acute efficacy of IV ketamine in TRD. CONCLUSION: Hitherto, available open-label data and controlled trial data support repeat administration of IV ketamine as an effective strategy to prolong the efficacy of ketamine's antidepressant effects (although not the focus of the study herein, maintenance repeat-dose esketamine treatment is proven effective in esketamine responders).

METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study compared a 4-week course of eight treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam. Each treatment was given as 10 separate IN sprays, self-administered 5 min apart. The study was stopped early due to poor tolerability after five treatment-resistant depressed participants were included. Feasibility, safety (acute and cumulative), cognitive and efficacy outcomes were assessed. Plasma ketamine and norketamine concentrations were assayed after the first treatment. RESULTS: Significant acute cardiovascular, psychotomimetic and neurological side effects occurred at doses < 100 mg ketamine. No participants were able to self-administer all 10 ketamine sprays due to incoordination; treatment time occasionally had to be extended (>45 min) due to acute side effects. No hepatic, cognitive or urinary changes were observed after the treatment course in either group. There was an approximately two-fold variation in ketamine and norketamine plasma concentrations between ketamine participants. At course end, one participant had remitted in each of the ketamine and midazolam groups. CONCLUSIONS: IN ketamine, with the drug formulation and delivery device used, was not a useful treatment approach in this study.

Positron emission tomography was used to examine the effect of psilocybin on the in vivo binding of [11C]raclopride to D2-dopamine receptors in the striatum in healthy volunteers after placebo and a psychotomimetic dose of psilocybin (n = 7). Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning. Psilocybin significantly decreased [11C]raclopride receptor binding potential (BP) bilaterally in the caudate nucleus (19%) and putamen (20%) consistent with an increase in endogenous dopamine. Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses.

Intravenous propofol, a sedative and hypnotic agent, is one of the choices of anesthetic for ECT. Ketamine, another anesthetic agent, providing sedation, amnesia, and analgesia, can also be used in patients undergoing ECT owing to its rapid action and persistent antidepressive effect. One adverse effect of ketamine is cardiovascular excitement, which may be reduced by propofol. Currently, the effects of combined anesthesia (propofol and ketamine) for patients with depressive disorder who have undergone ECT are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined agents for patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores greater than 20 were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=16 each): propofol group (group P), ketamine group (group K), and propofol plus ketamine group (group PK). Propofol (1.5 mg/kg), ketamine (0.8 mg/kg), and propofol (1.5 mg/kg) plus ketamine (0.8 mg/kg) were infused to each group of patients, respectively, before ECT by an anesthesiologist with no knowledge of the HDRS score. For the purpose of this study, the patients received a single ECT treatment and were assessed for depression using the HDRS scores (1 day before ECT and days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after the ECT treatment) by a psychiatrist with no knowledge of the randomization group. After the final assessment, the patients received further treatment as needed up to 3 treatments per week. Seizure energy index, seizure duration, and adverse effects were observed during anesthesia by a nurse with no knowledge of the study group. RESULTS: The HDRS scores improved earlier in group K and group PK. Decreases in HDRS scores were significantly greater in group K and group PK compared with those in group P. The adverse effects in group PK were fewer than those in group K. Seizure energy index and seizure duration in group K and group PK were higher and longer than those in group P during ECT.

Methods: 105 poly-drug consumers with former Ecstasy use and 41 persons with comparable drug history without Ecstasy use, and 11 drug naives were investigated for EEG features. Conventional EEG derivations of 19 electrodes according to the 10-20-system were conducted. Besides standard EEG bands, quantitative EEG analyses of 1-Hz-subdivided power ranges of Alpha, Theta and Beta bands have been considered. Results: Ecstasy users with medium and high cumulative Ecstasy doses revealed an increase in Theta and lower Alpha activities, significant increases in Beta activities, and a reduction of background activity. Ecstasy users with low cumulative Ecstasy doses showed a significant Alpha activity at 11 Hz. Interestingly, the spectral power of low frequencies in medium and high Ecstasy users was already significantly increased in the early phase of EEG recording. Statistical analyses suggested the main effect of Ecstasy to EEG results. Conclusions: Our data from a major sample of Ecstasy users support previous data revealing alterations of EEG frequency spectrum due rather to neurotoxic effects of Ecstasy on serotonergic systems in more detail. Accordingly, our data may be in line with the observation of attentional and memory impairments in Ecstasy users with moderate to high misuse. Despite the methodological problem of polydrug use also in our approach, our EEG results may be indicative of the neuropathophysiological background of the reported memory and attentional deficits in Ecstasy abusers. Overall, our findings may suggest the usefulness of EEG in diagnostic approaches in assessing neurotoxic sequela of this common drug abuse. \u00a9 2010 Adamaszek et al.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014097", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21124854/", "secondary_title": "PLoS ONE"}

In particular, the deficient generation of mismatch negativity (MMN) indicating auditory sensory memory is a characteristic finding in schizophrenic patients. Experimental studies implicate deficient N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptor functioning in such abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist rimonabant on MMN deficits in the NMDA receptor antagonist model of schizophrenia by using ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male subjects participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with subanesthetic doses of intravenous ketamine. The MMNs to frequency and duration deviants were elicited within an auditory oddball paradigm and recorded by a 32-channel EEG. Psychopathology was assessed using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory. RESULTS: Twenty subjects completed both experimental sessions. Ketamine infusion had no significant effect on MMN amplitudes in both deviance conditions. In contrast to placebo, co-administration of rimonabant produced significant deficits in MMN amplitudes to duration deviants at electrode position Fz. CONCLUSIONS: The results point to the involvement of the endogenous cannabinoid system in auditory sensory memory as a cognitive key feature in schizophrenia.

This single-site, open-label study investigates the proof of principle and safety of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and provides an initial impression of treatment effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 12 participants [>18 years] with DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD will receive a flexible dose of MDMA in a therapeutic setting on two dosing days over a 4 week period preceded by three preparatory sessions. Each MDMA dosing session will be followed by three integration sessions.

Available antidepressants often fail to provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI) in acutely suicidal patients with MDD and there are currently no approved treatments for this population. In 2016, esketamine (ESK) was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for MDD patients at imminent risk for suicide based on data suggesting rapid reduction in depressive symptoms, including SI observed at 4 hours after an initial dose of ESK nasal spray in a phase 2 study [2]. The efficacy and safety of ESK nasal spray is being further evaluated in ASPIRE\u20102, one of two phase 3 studies in the first global registration program in an understudied population of MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: ASPIRE\u20102 (NCT03097133) is an ongoing double\u2010blind (DB), randomised, placebo\u2010controlled study being conducted in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the United States. Adult patients (18 to 64 years) with MDD (DSM\u20105 criteria, confirmed by Mini\u2010International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), with active SI and intent and in need of psychiatric hospitalisation were eligible. All patients received optimized standard\u2010of\u2010care (SoC hospitalisation and initiation/optimisation of antidepressant treatment). Patients were randomised (1:1) to ESK (84 mg) or placebo nasal spray twice\u2010weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to SoC. Change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 24 hours after first dose in Montgomery\u2010\u01fasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary endpoint) and Clinical Global Impression \u2013 Severity of Suicidality \u2013 Revised (CGI\u2010SS\u2010R) from the Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Assessment Tool (SIBAT) were assessed for efficacy. Treatment\u2010emergent adverse events (TEAEs), potential suicidal events from the SIBAT and dissociative effects (Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS]) were monitored for safety. Results: In total, 230 patients have been randomised to ESK+SoC or placebo+SoC; 184 (80%) patients completed the DB treatment (Table 1). Conclusions: MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent represent a vulnerable group in need of rapid treatment of their symptoms. ASPIRE\u20102, along with ASPIRE\u20101, comprise a novel program that focuses on addressing depressive symptoms including SI in MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide who are typically excluded from clinical studies of antidepressants.

Ketamine, a phencyclidine derivative, is a non competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist. In healthy subjects its administration induces some positive symptoms (perceptual distortions.), negative symptoms (emotional deficit, apathy, social withdrawal) and cognitive changes (memory impairments and perseverations) that resemble some aspects of the symptoms of schizophrenia. A double blind cross over, placebo controlled was performed in 12 normal subjects with 2 sessions separated by one week of wash-out to determine ketamine-induced effects on behavioral and emotional responses. During each session, subjects received either ketamine or placebo (saline) infusion. A subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0,5 mg/kg) was administered by constant perfusion over 60 min. Behavioral and cognitive responses were assessed using positive and negative symptoms scales (BPRS, items from SAPS and SANS), vigilance and mood visual analog scale, subjective feelings using the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) and the Profile of Mood States (POMS). Using Philippot's method, emotions were elicited by films segments which induce a diversity of predictable emotions (fear, anger, sadness, joy, disgust and neutral state) and emotional responses were assessed by the Differential Emotions Scale (DES Izard). Low dose of ketamine induced significant effects on 7-items BPRS score (positive and negative items) and significant effects on positive and negative symptoms from SANS and SAPS. This was associated with emotional blunting of visually-induced responses that resemble aspects of schizophrenic emotional impairments. Ketamine impaired ARCI subscales (benzedrine subscale, pentobarbital-chlorpromazine subscale and LSD subscale). The recent findings of ketamine's pharmacology and imaging studies allow to draw several hypothesis related to neurotransmitter systems (glutamate, dopamine, serotonin interactions) and cerebral areas (particularly prefrontal cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, hippocampus) underlying some of these ketamine-induced effects.", "doi": "10.1016/s0987-7053(03)00028-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12909392/", "secondary_title": "Neurophysiol Clin"}

Recent studies suggest that a single low\u2010dose administration of ketamine can provide a long\u2010lasting effect on mood, but its effects when given in the postoperative period have not been studied. OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that a single low\u2010dose administration of ketamine after bariatric surgery can improve pain and mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. DESIGN We performed a randomised, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study to compare a single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine (0.4 mg kg\u20101) with a normal saline placebo in the postanaesthesia care unit after laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastrectomy. SETTING Single\u2010centre, tertiary care hospital, October 2014 to January 2018. PATIENTS A total of 100 patients were randomised into the ketamine and saline groups. INTERVENTION Patients in the ketamine group received a single dose of ketamine infusion (0.4 mg kg\u20101) in the postanaesthesia care unit. Patients in the placebo groups received 0.9% saline. OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the visual analogue pain score. A secondary outcome was performance on the short\u2010form McGill\u2019s Pain Questionnaire (SF\u2010MPQ). RESULTS There were no significant differences in visual analogue pain scores between groups (group\u2010by\u2010time interaction P \u00bc 0.966; marginal group effect P \u00bc 0.137). However, scores on the affective scale of SF\u2010MPQ (secondary outcome) significantly decreased in the ketamine group as early as postoperative day (POD) 2 [mean difference \u00bc \u20102.2 (95% bootstrap CI \u20102.9 to 1.6), Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.001], compared with placebo group in which the scores decreased only by POD 7.

The genetic, pharmacological and biochemical differences between ketamine responders and non-responders have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to employ a metabolomics approach, a global, non-targeted determination of endogenous metabolic patterns, to identify potential markers of ketamine response and non-response. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Plasma samples from 22 BD patients were analyzed to produce metabolomic patterns. The patients had received ketamine in a placebo-controlled crossover study and the samples were obtained 230\u2009min post-administration at which time the patients were categorized as responders or non-responders. Matching plasma samples from the placebo arm of the study were also analysed. During the study, the patients were maintained on either lithium or valproate. KEY RESULTS: The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate, irrespective of response to ketamine. In the patients maintained on lithium, 18 biomarkers were identified. In responders, lysophosphatidylethanolamines (4) and lysophosphatidylcholines (9) were increased relative to non-responders. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial \u03b2-oxidation of fatty acids. These differences were not produced by ketamine administration. The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy.", "doi": "10.1111/bph.12494", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24684390/", "secondary_title": "Br J Pharmacol"}

Here we evaluate the potential for baseline amygdala response, during the processing of emotional faces, to predict subsequent treatment response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine. Methods: Sixteen unmedicated depressed MDD patients (7 males) participated in an fMRI study.

A large data base is confirmatory and steadily expanding. Qualitative studies can inform best practices and suggest new research directions. As part of a clinical trial designed to identify biomarkers of ketamine response, a qualitative study was conducted to characterize experiences with: receiving infusions; recovering or not recovering from depression; and beliefs about why ketamine worked or did not work. METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression received three IV ketamine infusions in a two-week period and were characterized as remitters or non-remitters via symptom reduction 24\u00a0h after the third infusion. Qualitative interviews of a subset of participants were audio recorded, transcribed verbatim, and coded using deductive and inductive methods. Themes were derived and compared across a broader construct of recovery status. RESULTS: Of the 21 participants, nine (43\u00a0%) were characterized as having experienced remission and 12 (57\u00a0%) non-remission. Of the 12 non-remitters, five were characterized as having experienced partial recovery based on their subjective experiences, reporting substantial benefit from ketamine infusions despite non-remission status based on scale measurements. Attributions for ketamine's effects included biological and experiential mechanisms. Among non-remitters there was risk of disappointment when adding another failed treatment. LIMITATIONS: A more diverse sample may have yielded different themes. Different patients had different amounts of time elapsed between ketamine infusions and qualitative interview.

However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework.

Using an open-label design, 16 transdiagnostic CL patients were recruited, 18-65 years old, to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting.

These gains were uniformly maintained to 6 months post-infusion. Open-label ketamine appeared to rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra-high-risk, heterogeneous, real-world sample. Ketamine infusion may therefore be a safe, feasible, viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among medically hospitalized patients after a suicide attempt, with potentially enduring benefits.

Recent evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) supports the rapid antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of ayahuasca on plasma cortisol and awakening salivary cortisol response, in the same group of treatment-resistant patients (MD) and in healthy volunteers (C). Subjects received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo (dosing session), and both plasma and awakening salivary cortisol response were measured at baseline (before dosing session) and 48 h after the dosing session. Baseline assessment (D0) showed blunted awakening salivary cortisol response and hypocortisolemia in patients, with respect to healthy controls. Salivary cortisol was also measured during dosing session, and we observed higher increases for both C and MD that ingested ayahuasca than placebo. After 48 h from the dosing session with ayahuasca, patients' awakening salivary cortisol response is similar to the ones detected in controls. No significant changes in plasma cortisol levels were observed 48 h after the sessions. Therefore, these findings point to new evidence on the modulation of salivary cortisol levels as a result of an ayahuasca session, both in healthy and depressive volunteers. Considering that cortisol acts in regulation of distinct physiological pathways, emotional and cognitive processes, it is assumed to be critically involved to the etiology of depression and its regulation seems to be important for the treatment and remission of major depression, ayahuasca use as antidepressant should be further investigated.

Methods: We analyzed acute subjective drug effects (mystical, challenging, and intensity) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies (total N = 288) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg (inclusive). Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg (n = 120), participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg (n = 182), and participants whose weight-adjusted dose was about 25 mg (to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder) (n = 103). Results: In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight-adjusted groups, and in the fixed dose group, no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex. Across a wide range of body weights (49 to 113 kg) the present results showed no evidence that body weight affected subjective effects of psilocybin.

In the original article, there was an error in Figure 1 which shows the amine and aryl group moved one carbon over on the cyclohexanone structure whereas they should be next to the ketone. A corrected Figure 1 can be found in the NIHMS manuscript, but was too late for the journal publication. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-49924-018[/rid]). Ketamine shows promise as a rapidly-acting treatment for depression and suicidal ideation, but side effects and abuse potential limit its use. Understanding its mechanism of action could help develop analogous but safer drugs. This post hoc study explored relationships of ketamine and metabolites, including hydroxynorketamine enantiomers, (2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-HNK, to clinical response in a subgroup from a published trial in suicidal depression. Depressed adults with clinically significant suicidal ideation were randomized to double-blind infusion of sub-anesthetic ketamine or midazolam. Ketamine and metabolites were measured after infusion (N = 53). Plasma (2R,6R)-HNK was associated with change (higher levels correlated with less clinical improvement) from baseline to 24 h post-infusion of depression (HDRS-24: Spearman r = 0.37, p = 0.009) and suicidal thoughts (SSI: Spearman r = 0.29, p = 0.041). There were similar correlations with weekly follow-up clinical rating scores for both HNK enantiomers and dehydronorketamine (DHNK). Ketamine and norketamine were not associated with change in depression or suicidal ideation (unadjusted p > 0.28).

However, recent studies have found that the relationship between ecstasy use and psychological symptoms was no longer significant after controlling for marijuana use (e.g., Morgan et al., 2002). The goal of the present study was to examine the relationship between ecstasy exposure and self-reported executive functioning and psychological symptoms after controlling for gender, ethnicity, and other drug use. Methods: Data were collected from 65 men and women with a wide range of ecstasy use (including 17 marijuana-using controls). Participants were administered the Frontal Systems Behavioral Scale, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory for adults, and the Beck Depression Inventory-2nd edition. Results: Although 19-63% of the ecstasy users demonstrated clinically elevated psychological symptoms, frequency of ecstasy use did not predict the psychological symptoms. No gender differences or interactions were observed. Conclusions: These results revealed that, although ecstasy users demonstrate elevated levels of psychological symptoms and executive dysfunction, these symptoms are not statistically associated with their ecstasy consumption. Instead, other drug use (alcohol, marijuana, opioids, and inhalants) significantly predict psychological symptoms in this sample of polydrug users. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples\u2019 experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00\u20131.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00\u20134.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85\u20130.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience.

METHODS: Twenty-nine drug-free TRD patients (12 suicide attempters/17 non-attempters) participated in a crossover randomized trial of ketamine. MEG data were collected during an attentional dot probe task with emotional face stimuli at baseline and several hours post-ketamine infusion. Synthetic aperture magnetometry was used to project source power in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies for angry-neutral, happy-neutral, and neutral-neutral face pairings during a one-second peristimulus period. Mixed models were used to test for clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of group, emotion, session, and SI score. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly reduced SI and depression across the sample. Post-ketamine, attempters had improved accuracy and non-attempters had reduced accuracy on the task. SI was positively associated with gamma power in regions of the frontal and parietal cortices across groups. In an extended amygdala-hippocampal region, attempters differed significantly in their emotional reactivity to angry versus happy faces as indexed by theta power differences, irrespective of drug. Ketamine significantly reduced the association between alpha power and SI for angry compared with happy faces in a fronto-insular/anterior cingulate region important for regulating sensory attentiveness. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include a small sample size of attempters.

As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5\u03bcg, 13\u03bcg, or 26\u03bcg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection.

The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants\u2019 ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants\u2019 desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non\u2010symptomatic volunteers suggest that \u201cmicrodoses\u201d of LSD have dose\u2010dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of \u226447 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

However, no modern studies have evaluated differences in subjective and autonomic effects of LSD and psilocybin or their similarities and dose equivalence. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 28 healthy subjects (14 women, 14 men) who underwent five 25\u2009h sessions and received placebo, LSD (100 and 200\u2009\u00b5g), and psilocybin (15 and 30\u2009mg). Test days were separated by at least 10 days. Outcome measures included self-rating scales for subjective effects, autonomic effects, adverse effects, effect durations, plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), prolactin, cortisol, and oxytocin, and pharmacokinetics. The doses of 100 and 200\u2009\u00b5g LSD and 30\u2009mg psilocybin produced comparable subjective effects. The 15\u2009mg psilocybin dose produced clearly weaker subjective effects compared with both doses of LSD and 30\u2009mg psilocybin. The 200\u2009\u00b5g dose of LSD induced higher ratings of ego-dissolution, impairments in control and cognition, and anxiety than the 100\u2009\u00b5g dose. The 200\u2009\u00b5g dose of LSD increased only ratings of ineffability significantly more than 30\u2009mg psilocybin. LSD at both doses had clearly longer effect durations than psilocybin. Psilocybin increased blood pressure more than LSD, whereas LSD increased heart rate more than psilocybin. However, both LSD and psilocybin showed comparable cardiostimulant properties, assessed by the rate-pressure product. Both LSD and psilocybin had dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination. Both doses of LSD and the high dose of psilocybin produced qualitatively and quantitatively very similar subjective effects, indicating that alterations of mind that are induced by LSD and psilocybin do not differ beyond the effect duration. Any differences between LSD and psilocybin are dose-dependent rather than substance-dependent. However, LSD and psilocybin differentially increased heart rate and blood pressure.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other select indoleamine 5\u2010hydroxytryptamine 2A (5\u2010HT2A) receptor ligands confer sustained therapeutic benefit in cluster and migraine headache, though controlled studies are lacking. We sought to carry out the first controlled investigations of the effects and safety of psilocybin in these headache disorders. Methods: Two exploratory clinical trials were carried out in adult males and females with migraine or cluster headache (twelve each). The migraine design was a double\u2010blind, placebocontrolled, cross\u2010over study and the cluster design was a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study. Migraine subjects received single administrations of oral placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) two weeks apart. Cluster subjects were randomized to receive a pulse regimen of three administrations of either psilocybin (0.143 mg/ kg) or placebo, each administration separated by approximately 5 days. Headache diaries, in which subjects documented headache attacks, began two weeks before the first test day and ended two weeks after the second test day for migraine subjects and two months after the last test day for cluster subjects. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessionsand several follow\u2010up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures. Ten subjects in each the migraine and cluster studies were included in the final analysis. Results: Over the 2\u2010week period after single drug administration, the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin [\u20101.65 (95% CI: \u20102.53 to \u20100.77) days/week] than after placebo [\u20100.15 (\u20101.13 to 0.83) days/ week; p = 0.003, t(9) = 4.11; effect size \u20101.15]. Over the 3\u2010week period after initiating the pulse regimen, the reduction in weekly cluster attacks from baseline was greater with psilocybin [\u20106.03 (\u20109.96 to \u20102.10)] than with placebo [+1.17 (\u20102.76 to 5.10); p = 0.017, t(8) = 2.99; effect size \u20101.89]. In neither study did the rating of psychedelic effects during acute psilocybin exposure correlate with the change in headache burden. Psilocybin was welltolerated in both studies and there were no unexpected or serious adverse events. Conclusions: These two exploratory controlled trials showed that limited administration of a low oral dose of psilocybin has sustained therapeutic effects in migraine and cluster headache.

METHOD: The subjects studied were 32 ecstasy consumers who were treated at two drug-dependency outpatient centers for hallucinatory-delusive manifestations and who were diagnosed as having ecstasy-induced psychotic disorder according to DSM-IV criteria. For the assessment of the intensity of the syndrome and its follow-up, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) were used at the outset and after 1, 3 and 6 months. All subjects received treatment with olanzapine. RESULTS: The treatment program was completed by 96.9% of the patients. At the baseline assessment, a high incidence of symptoms of a severe psychiatric disorder was observed. From the first month the psychotic symptoms (BPRS) were considerably reduced with treatment, with the most severe positive symptoms remitting in the first 3 months. The three assessment indicators (BPRS, HDRS and CGI) showed a statistically significant clinical reduction over the 6 months of the assessment period. Furthermore, no relevant side effects were noted.

Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13\u2009mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3\u2009g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)).

Evidence suggesting cognitive benefits from nicotine administration, together with the high rate of cigarette use in patients with schizophrenia, has stimulated interest in whether nicotine modulates NMDAR hypofunction. We examined the interactive effects of ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist that produces transient schizophrenia-like neurophysiological effects, and nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, in 30 healthy volunteers to determine whether nicotine prevents or attenuates MMN abnormalities. Secondary analyses compared the profile of ketamine and schizophrenia effects on MMN using previously reported data from 24 schizophrenia patients (Hay et al. 2015). Healthy volunteers completed four test days, during which they received ketamine/placebo and nicotine/placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. MMN to intensity, frequency, duration, and frequency+duration double deviant sounds was assessed each day. Ketamine decreased intensity, frequency, and double deviant MMN amplitudes, whereas nicotine increased intensity and double deviant MMN amplitudes. A ketamine\u00d7nicotine interaction indicated, however, that nicotine failed to attenuate the decrease in MMN associated with ketamine. Although the present dose of ketamine produced smaller decrements in MMN than those associated with schizophrenia, the profile of effects across deviant types did not differ between ketamine and schizophrenia.

Substance use expectancies are assumed to be an essential component in explaining substance use behaviour and, therefore, the development of effective substance use prevention and treatment strategies. Method: Dutch young adults with an online interest in drug-related social media posts were targeted with an online survey about their use of alcohol and drugs. This resulted in a convenience sample (N = 4182, 73.4% female, M<sub>age</sub> = 21.11), of which 35.5% had used ecstasy at least once in their life and 29.3% had used ecstasy last year. Latent class analyses were used to identify subgroups based on both positive and negative expectancies of ecstasy use. Cross-class differences were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results: This study yielded four distinct classes: only negative expectancies (13.6%), high positive and negative expectancies (23.5%), low to moderate positive and negative expectancies (20.6%), and mostly positive expectancies (22.4%). These classes differed significantly in lifetime experience with ecstasy use, intention to use ecstasy, perception of harmfulness and availability, and social norms regarding the use of ecstasy. Conclusion: Findings show that ecstasy use expectancies can be used to create meaningful classes of users and non-users, and that these classes are different enough to warrant varied prevention approaches.

Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0\u20138, 8\u201316 and 16\u201324 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration\u2013subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6\u20132.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0\u20133.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 \u03bcg LSD, respectively. Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half-lives were 3.7 h (3.4\u20134.1) and 4.0 h (3.6\u20134.4), for 85 and 170 \u03bcg LSD, respectively. Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (\u00b1standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 \u00b1 3.2 and 11 \u00b1 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 \u00b1 18% and 87 \u00b1 13% after 85 and 170 \u03bcg of LSD, respectively. Conclusion: The present novel study validates previous findings. LSD exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination kinetics and dose-dependent duration and intensity of subjective effects. LSD is extensively metabolized and shows dose-proportional urinary recovery.", "doi": "10.1111/bcp.15887", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37596682/", "secondary_title": "British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology"}

This study sought to develop a new scale to measure psychological insight after a psychedelic experience: the Psychological Insight Scale (PIS). Methods: The PIS is a six- to seven-item questionnaire that enquires about psychological insight after a psychedelic experience (PIS-6) and accompanied behavioural changes (PIS item 7). In total, 886 participants took part in a study in which the PIS and other questionnaires were completed in a prospective fashion in relation to a planned psychedelic experience. For validation purposes, data from 279 participants were analysed from a non-specific \u2018global psychedelic survey\u2019 study. Results: Principal components analysis of PIS scores revealed a principal component explaining 73.57% of the variance, which displayed high internal consistency at multiple timepoints throughout the study (average Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.94). Criterion validity was confirmed using the global psychedelic survey study, and convergent validity was confirmed via the Therapeutic-Realizations Scale. Furthermore, PIS scores significantly mediated the relationship between emotional breakthrough and long-term well-being. Conclusion: The PIS is complementary to current subjective measures used in psychedelic studies, most of which are completed in relation to the acute experience. Insight \u2013 as measured by the PIS \u2013 was found to be a key mediator of long-term psychological outcomes following a psychedelic experience.

In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition (Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. METHOD: Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression (inadequate response to \u22653 antidepressants) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly. Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (n = 36) or midazolam (n = 21), a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar, rapid anesthetic effects. Twenty four hours postinfusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group. RESULTS: Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24 hr, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (\u03c7(2) = 4.6; P = .03). Implicit associations between self- and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine (P = .01; d = .58) but not midazolam (P = .68; d = .09). Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline, and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms.

RESULTS: Seven studies, with 130 patients, were analysed in this review. Three were conducted in patients with depression, two in patients with anxiety and two in patients with both. In a supportive setting, ayahuasca, psilocybin, and LSD consistently produced immediate and significant anti-depressant and anxiolytic effects that were endured for several months.

Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%).

Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant.

Prompted by the promising preliminary studies, a randomized, double-blind trial has recently been launched across Europe and North America to investigate the efficacy of psilocybin in TRD. One of these centres is based in Ireland - CHO Area 7 and Tallaght University Hospital. The outcome of this trial will determine whether psilocybin with psychological support will successfully translate into the psychiatric clinic for the benefit of patients.", "doi": "10.1017/ipm.2019.39", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31543078/", "secondary_title": "Ir J Psychol Med"}

A recent Phase 3 clinical trial reported high efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for treating patients with severe PTSD compared to a therapy with placebo group (NCT03537014). This raises important questions regarding potential mechanisms of MDMA-assisted therapy. In the present study, we examined epigenetic changes in three key HPA axis genes before and after MDMA and placebo with therapy. As a pilot sub-study to the parent clinical trial, we assessed potential HPA epigenetic predictors for treatment response with genomic DNA derived from saliva (MDMA, n = 16; placebo, n = 7). Methylation levels at all 259 CpG sites annotated to three HPA genes (CRHR1, FKBP5, and NR3C1) were assessed in relation to treatment response as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; Total Severity Score). Second, group (MDMA vs. placebo) differences in methylation change were assessed for sites that predicted treatment response. RESULTS: Methylation change across groups significantly predicted symptom reduction on 37 of 259 CpG sites tested, with two sites surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Further, the MDMA-treatment group showed more methylation change compared to placebo on one site of the NR3C1 gene. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that therapy-related PTSD symptom improvements may be related to DNA methylation changes in HPA genes and such changes may be greater in those receiving MDMA-assisted therapy. These findings can be used to generate hypothesis driven analyses for future studies with larger cohorts.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2023.959590", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36815187/", "secondary_title": "Front Psychiatry"}

Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n\u00a0=\u00a066) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75\u2009mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures. RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a066; mean QIDS-SR(16) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR(16) -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score decrease \u226550% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score \u22645) was 20% after four infusions. Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment-emergent hypomania observed in only three patients (4.5%) with zero cases of mania or psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world effectiveness of IV ketamine for bipolar depression was observed. Repeated doses were associated with greater symptom reduction and adequate tolerability.", "doi": "10.1111/bdi.13284", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36516343/", "secondary_title": "Bipolar Disord"}

The objective of this systematic review, inclusive of meta-analysis, is to examine recent clinical research on the therapeutic effects of classic psychedelics on depressive symptoms. METHODS: Fourteen psychedelic therapy studies, utilising psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, were systematically reviewed. For the meta-analysis, standardised mean differences were calculated for seven randomised controlled trials. RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support. In the meta-analysis, symptom reduction was significantly indicated in three timepoints out of four, including 1-day, 1-week, and 3-5\u00a0weeks, supporting the results of the systematic review, with the exception of the 6-8\u00a0weeks follow-up point which was less conclusive. LIMITATIONS: The absence of required data for 2 studies necessitated the less precise use of graphical extraction and imputation. The small sample size in all but one study negatively affected the statistical power. None of the studies had long-term follow-up without also utilising the cross-over method, which did not allow for long-term results to be included in the meta-review. CONCLUSIONS: This review indicates an association between psychedelic therapy and significant reduction of depressive symptoms at several time points. However, the small number of studies, and low sample sizes, calls for careful interpretation of results.

Growing evidence suggests that humans who use MDMA recreationally can also develop 5-HT neurotoxic injury, although functional consequences have been difficult to identify. Twenty-five abstinent MDMA users and 23 non-MDMA using controls were studied to determine whether pharmacologic depletion of brain catecholamines by alpha-methyl-para-tyrosine (AMPT) would differentially effect MDMA users on measures of cognition and sleep, two processes dually modulated by brain serotonergic and catecholaminergic neurons. During a 5-day in-patient study, all subjects underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing, repeated computerized cognitive testing, and all-night sleep studies. At baseline, MDMA users had performance deficits on tasks of verbal and visuospatial working memory and displayed increased behavioral impulsivity on several computerized tasks, reflecting a tendency to perform quickly at the expense of accuracy. Baseline sleep architecture was also altered in abstinent MDMA users compared to controls. AMPT produced differential effects in MDMA users compared to controls on several cognitive and sleep measures. Differences in cognitive performance, impulsivity, and sleep were significantly correlated with MDMA use. These data extend findings from earlier studies demonstrating cognitive deficits, behavioral impulsivity, and sleep alterations in abstinent MDMA users, and suggest that lasting effects of MDMA lead to alterations in the ability to modulate behaviors reciprocally influenced by 5-HT and catecholamines. More research is needed to determine potential relationships between sleep abnormalities, cognitive deficits and impulsive behavior in abstinent MDMA users. \u00a9 2007 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.", "doi": "10.1038/sj.npp.1301302", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17203011/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Objectives: We examined whether change in ecstasy use was associated with change in depressive symptoms/probable depression over a 4-year period, among a large Australian sample. Methods: The Personality and Total Health project is a longitudinal general community study of Australians from Canberra and Queanbeyan. Data from the youngest cohort when aged 24-30 (N = 2, 128) and 4 years later (N = 1, 977) was included. The Goldberg depression scale and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire measured depressive symptoms and probable depression, respectively. Multilevel growth models also considered demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and other drug use. Results: Ecstasy use was not associated with long-term depressive symptoms or greater odds of depression in multivariate analyses. Users had more self-reported depressive symptoms when using ecstasy compared to not using. However, differences between people who had and had not ever used ecstasy largely accounted for this. Other factors were more important in the prediction of depression. Conclusions: It would be premature to conclude that ecstasy use is not related to the development of long-term depressive symptoms, given the relatively low level of ecstasy and other drug use in this community sample. Results showed that other factors need to be considered when investigating ecstasy use and depression. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-013-3132-7", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23681160/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology"}

These studies assessed performance during daytime, whereas in real life, dance-attendees leaving a party use the drug during the night. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to assess the effects of nocturnal doses of MDMA on psychomotor performance and impulsivity during the night and after a night of sleep deprivation. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way within-subject study. The treatment was MDMA (75 and 50 mg) divided over the evening or double placebo. Psychomotor and impulsivity tasks were conducted four times throughout the evening and night. A vigilance test was conducted once, at 5 A.M.,: and a sleepiness scale was presented to the subjects ten times throughout the evening and night. RESULTS: MDMA impaired tracking performance in a simple tracking task. Divided attention task performance was also impaired as indicated by a decrease in secondary task performance under the influence of MDMA compared with placebo. MDMA did not affect impulsivity measures. Vigilance performance decreased as a function of time on task, but this decrement was less during MDMA treatment compared to placebo. After the administration of MDMA, the sleepiness scale scores were lower during the night when compared with placebo. This difference between MDMA and placebo disappeared in the morning. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that nocturnal doses of MDMA may produce impairments of tracking performance and divided attention throughout the night that are additive to performance impairment produced by sleep loss.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-006-0679-6", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17219216/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}
