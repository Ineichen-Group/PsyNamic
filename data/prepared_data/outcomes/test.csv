"1254","Subjective features of the psilocybin experience that may account for its self-administration by humans: a double-blind comparison of psilocybin and dextromethorphan.^\nRATIONALE: Although both psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) produce psychedelic-like subjective effects, rates of non-medical use of psilocybin are consistently greater than DXM. OBJECTIVE: New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non-medical use. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength. Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin: liking, visual effects, positive mood, insight, positive social effects, increased awareness of beauty (both visual and music), awe/amazement, meaningfulness, and mystical experience. For most ratings, (1) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo; (2) psilocybin showed dose-related increases; 3, DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin; (4) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM. These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects (alternatively described as the ""motivation"" to use). Observed differences on these domains between psilocybin and DXM are consistent with the relative rates of non-medical use of psilocybin and DXM.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"1281","Current and former ecstasy users report different sleep to matched controls: A web-based questionnaire study.^\nThis study sought to test the association between ecstasy-use and abnormal sleep. An anonymous web-based questionnaire containing questions on drug use and sleep was completed by 1035 individuals. From this large sample, a group of 89 ecstasy users were found who reported very little use of other drugs. This ""ecstasy-only"" group was further divided into two groups of 31 current users and 58 abstinent users. The subjective sleep of current and former ecstasy-only users was compared with that of matched controls. Patients were asked to rate their sleep according to: 1) sleep quality, 2) sleep latency, 3) night time awakenings and 4) total sleep time. Current ecstasy-only users reported significantly worse sleep quality (P?<?0.05) and a greater total sleep time (P?<?0.001) than controls. It was inferred that these differences might be due to recovery from the acute effects of the drug. Abstinent ecstasy-only users reported significantly more nighttime awakenings than controls (P?<?0.01). These subjective findings are in agreement with the objective findings of previous studies showing persistent sleep abnormalities in ecstasy users. © 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"2153","Effects of ayahuasca on the endocannabinoid system of healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder: Results from two pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized, placebo-controlled trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess endocannabinoid (anandamide, AEA; 2-arachidonoylglycerol, 2-AG) plasma levels in healthy volunteers and in volunteers with social anxiety disorder (SAD) after a single oral dose of ayahuasca or placebo. METHODS: Post hoc analysis of endocannabinoid plasma levels (baseline, 90 and 240 min after drug intake) from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials. In Study 1, 20 healthy volunteers ingested ayahuasca (average 1.58 mg/ml dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) or placebo, and in Study 2, 17 volunteers with SAD received ayahuasca (average 0.680 mg/ml DMT) or placebo. RESULTS: A significant difference was observed in AEA concentrations in Study 2 after ayahuasca intake (Χ(2) (2) = 6.5, p = 0.03, Friedman test), and near significant differences (increases) were observed between baseline and 90 (Z = 0, p = 0.06, Wilcoxon test) and 240 (Z = 10, p = 0.06) minutes after ayahuasca intake. CONCLUSIONS: Although our findings suggest that ayahuasca could modulate AEA levels in SAD patients, the high interindividual variability in both trials and the small samples preclude definitive conclusions. More research with larger samples is needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other hallucinogens in the endocannabinoid system.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2830","No difference in brain activation during cognitive performance between ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users and control subjects: A [H215O]-positron emission tomography study.^\nThe long-term use of the serotonin-releaser and uptake-inhibitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") has been associated with memory impairments and increased liability to depressive mood and anxiety attacks. It is unclear, however, whether these psychologic deviations are reflected in alterations of the underlying neurophysiologic substrate. The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-naïve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O]. Mood was assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the EWL Mood Rating Scale. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention. However, significantly higher levels of depressiveness as determined by the HAM-D and EWL scales were found in Ecstasy-using subjects. These data indicate that, despite differences in mood, polytoxic Ecstasy users do not differ from Ecstasy-naïve controls in terms of local brain activity. Heightened depressiveness in the Ecstasy group was consistent with results from previous studies and could be related to serotonergic hypofunction resulting from repeated MDMA consumption. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences are preexisting rather than a result of Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4019","Psilocybin-assisted therapy for reducing alcohol intake in patients with alcohol use disorder: protocol for a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial (The QUANTUM Trip Trial).^\nINTRODUCTION: Alcohol use disorder is a difficult-to-treat psychiatric disorder and a major burden on public health. Existing treatment efficacy is moderate, and relapse rates are high. Preliminary findings suggest that psilocybin, a psychedelic compound, can safely and reliably occasion highly meaningful experiences that may spur a positive change in drinking behaviour when administered in a therapeutic context. However, the efficacy of a single psilocybin administration and its potential neurobiological underpinnings still remain unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To establish efficacy, we will investigate the effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy versus placebo in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial. Ninety treatment-seeking patients, aged 20-70 years, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder will be recruited from the community via advertisement and referrals from general practitioners or specialised treatment units. The psilocybin or placebo will be administered in accordance with a protocol for psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postdosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow-up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes are as follows: (1) total alcohol consumption, (2) phosphatidyl-ethanol, an objective biomarker for alcohol, (3) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range, (4) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome and (5) neuronal response to alcohol cues and cognitive flexibility within corticostriatal pathways by use of functional MR brain imaging 1-week postdosing. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: Ethical approval has been obtained from the Committee on Health Research Ethics of the Capital Region of Denmark (H-20043832). All patients will be provided oral and written information about the trial before screening. The study results will be disseminated by peer-review publications and conference presentations.

"4969","The serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram reduces acute cardiovascular and vegetative effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('Ecstasy') in healthy volunteers.^\nMDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or 'Ecstasy' is a widely used recreational drug that produces a state of heightened mood but also cardiovascular and vegetative side-effects. In animals, MDMA releases serotonin and, to a lesser extent, dopamine and norepinephrine. The release of serotonin can be blocked by serotonin uptake inhibitors such as citalopram. It is unknown to what extent this mechanism is also responsible for the physiological side-effects of MDMA seen in humans. We investigated the effect of citalopram pretreatment (40 mg i.v.) on vegetative and cardiovascular effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers. MDMA moderately increased blood pressure and heart rate, slightly elevated body temperature and produced a broad range of acute and short-term side-effects. Citalopram reduced all these MDMA-induced physiological changes except for body temperature. These findings suggest that physiological effects of MDMA in humans are partially due to an interaction of MDMA with the serotonin carrier and a subsequent release of serotonin.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5032","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

"6007","Does a Single Intravenous Dose of Ketamine Reduce the Need for Supplemental Opioids in Post-Cesarean Section Patients?.^\nEligible women for elective cesarean section admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit of Prentice Women's Hospital will be approached for study participation immediately after the routine preanesthetic evaluation. This occurs shortly after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit. Women who agree to participate will give written, informed consent at this time. Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with intravenous (IV) access, aspiration prophylaxis and intraoperative monitoring. Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic medications will be used as per usual practice after delivery. The anesthesiologist will perform a spinal anesthetic per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3‐4 interspace (± one vertebral interspace). The spinal anesthetic will consist of 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl + 150 μg of morphine. The subject will be placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression. Cesarean section will commence after adequate anesthesia is assured to a T4 sensory level to pinprick. Vasopressors and IV fluids will be administered at the anesthesiologist's discretion per usual practice. At the time of delivery, subjects will be randomized to one of two groups using a computer generated random number table. Randomization will be blocked based on whether the cesarean procedure is a primary or a repeat procedure. Randomization assignments will be kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened by a research nurse who will prepare a 20 mL syringe labeled ""study drug"". The syringe will be given to the anesthesiologist blinded to the treatment group who will subsequently administer the study drug. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive ketamine 10 mg (ketamine 10 mg/mL) diluted to 20 mL with 0.9% preservative free saline. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive 20 mL preservative free saline. The study drug will be administered into the intravenous line via an infusion pump over 10 minutes. Five minutes after placebo or drug administration, the anesthesiologist will ask the subject if she has nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Nausea and pruritus will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe; and vomiting as present or absent. Any spontaneous complaints of psychedelic effects will be noted at this time. Sedation will be assessed via the Richmond agitation‐sedation scale (RASS [see Appendix 1]). Upon completion of the cesarean section, the subject will be transported to the post anesthesia recovery unit. Patients will receive ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hours time 4 doses beginning shortly after admission to the PACU. At 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and at 24 h after administration of the study drug, the subject's pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale for pain NRS 0‐10 (see Appendix 2). Patients may request rescue analgesia if they are experiencing discomfort. The time of first rescue analgesia request will be noted, and the NRS will be determined at the time of request for rescue analgesia. Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per os. An additional dose of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg will be provided after 1 hour if the pain is not relieved to the subject's satisfaction. These are routine oral analgesic medications for postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia. Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and respiratory rate, and treatment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression). The total amount of rescue medication will be determined for each subject after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The presence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus will be assessed at the same time intervals as the NRS for pain: 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after IV infusion of ketamine or placebo. The subjective psychedelic effects of ketamine and morphine will be assessed using a set of true/false questions from the LSD and morphine short form of the Addiction Research Center In entory, ARCI (Appendix 3). These questions will be administered verbally by the anesthesiologist or researcher blinded to the treatment group upon admission to the PACU and at 4 h. The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and secondary outcome data: maternal age, height, weight, prepregnancy weight, gestational age and IV fluids administered during cesarean section. In addition, all intraoperative and postoperative medications will be recorded, including those administered for the treatment of side effects listed above. Protocol specific analgesia assessment ends 24 hours after administration of the study drug. At 72 hours the subject will be asked about her satisfaction with postoperative analgesia (100 mm scale, 0 mm = not satisfied at all, 100 mm = very satisfied). One telephone follow‐up evaluation 2 weeks after delivery will again, assess for satisfaction with analgesia and average pain (NRS) since the procedure.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

We will define the signs and symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy ‐ we refer to these effects as a discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post‐MDMA depression are unknown but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained 36 hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia. In this study we will evaluate the effects of MDMA on ADH release, urine sodium excretion, and the relationship of gender to these effects.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6449","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Seventy-three children under 5 years of age, who were scheduled for invasive procedure, were assigned to one of three groups: IV group (n = 25), ketamine 1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg were given intravenously; PO group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given orally; and PR group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg given rectally. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for side-effects. Optimal sedation (drowsy and asleep) was provided in 78 per cent of all patients and no statistical difference was observed among the three groups. No severe complications were observed in all groups. Recovery time from sedation was significantly longer in the intravenous group (>120 min in two patients). Hallucination was noted in three (12 per cent) patients given intravenous medication, but not in those given oral or rectal medications. It is concluded that intravenous, oral, and rectal midazolam/ketamine are equally effective for invasive procedures in children with malignancy.

"7483","Acute and Sustained Reductions in Loss of Meaning and Suicidal Ideation Following Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy for Psychiatric and Existential Distress in Life-Threatening Cancer.^\nPeople with advanced cancer are at heightened risk of desire for hastened death (DHD), suicidal ideation (SI), and completed suicide. Loss of Meaning (LoM), a component of demoralization, can be elevated by a cancer diagnosis and predicts DHD and SI in this population. We completed a randomized controlled trial in which psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) produced rapid and sustained improvements in depression, demoralization, and hopelessness in people with cancer. Converging epidemiologic and clinical trial findings suggests a potential antisuicidal effect of this treatment. To probe our hypothesis that PAP relieves SI through its beneficial impacts on depression and demoralization (LoM in particular), we performed secondary analyses assessing within- and between-group differences with regard to LoM and an SI composite score. Among participants with elevated SI at baseline, PAP was associated with within-group reductions in SI that were apparent as early as 8 h and persisted for 6.5 months postdosing. PAP also produced large reductions in LoM from baseline that were apparent 2 weeks after treatment and remained significant and robust at the 6.5 month and 3.2 and 4.5 year follow-ups. Exploratory analyses support our hypothesis and suggest that PAP may be an effective antisuicidal intervention following a cancer diagnosis due to its positive impact on hopelessness and demoralization and its effects on meaning-making in particular. These preliminary results implicate psilocybin treatment as a potentially effective alternative to existing antidepressant medications in patients with cancer that are also suicidal, and warrant further investigation in participants with elevated levels of depression and suicidality.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8320","Dose-response study of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans. II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate ""nonblind,"" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. ""Loss of control,"" associated with a brief, but overwhelming ""rush,"" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans. They also may be used to compare the effects of other agents affecting relevant brain receptors in volunteer and psychiatric populations.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"2118","An open-label pilot trial assessing tolerability and feasibility of LSD microdosing in patients with major depressive disorder (LSDDEP1).^\nBACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated 260 million people suffer from depression [1], and there is a clear need for the development of new, alternative antidepressant therapies. In light of problems with the tolerability and efficacy of available treatments [2], a global trend is emerging for patients to self-treat depression with microdoses of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin [3]. Beyond anecdotal reports from those who self-medicate in this way, few clinical trials have evaluated this practice. In our recently published phase 1 study in healthy volunteers [4], we determined that LSD microdosing was relatively safe and well tolerated in that cohort. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that conducting such microdosing trials is broadly feasible, with excellent adherence and compliance to the regimen observed. In this open-label pilot trial of patients with major depressive disorder (LSDDEP1), we will test the tolerability and feasibility of an 8-week regimen of LSD microdosing in this patient group prior to a larger subsequent randomised controlled trial (LSDDEP2). METHODS: Twenty patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder will receive an 8-week LSD microdosing treatment regimen. The treatment protocol will use a sublingual formulation of LSD (MB-22001) delivered twice per week under a titration schedule using a dose of 5-15 µg. Tolerability will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of participants who withdraw from the trial due to adverse events attributable to the treatment regimen, while feasibility will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of attended clinic visits once enrolled. To determine whether there is any antidepressant response to the LSD microdosing regimen, MADRS scores will be assessed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the commencement of the regimen. DISCUSSION: The results of LSDDEP1 will provide valuable information regarding the tolerability and feasibility of a proposed LSD microdosing regimen in patients with MDD. Such information is critically important to optimise trial design prior to commencing a subsequent and more resource-intensive randomised controlled trial.

"2625","Visuospatial working memory impairment in current and previous ecstasy/polydrug users.^\nObjective Previous research suggests that ecstasy users are impaired in processing visuospatial information. However, for the most part, the deficits observed appear to involve the recall and recognition of complex visual and geometric patterns. The present research sought to determine whether ecstasy use was associated with deficits in serial spatial recall and visuospatial working memory (VSWM). Methods Thirty-eight current ecstasy/polydrug users, 16 previous ecstasy/polydrug users and 52 non ecstasy users completed serial simple spatial recall and VSWM tasks. Results Both the current and previous users of ecstasy exhibited deficits on the VSWM task. Following controls for group differences in aspects of cannabis and cocaine use, the overall group effect fell to just below statistical significance. However, the difference contrast comparing users with nonusers continued to demonstrate a statistically significant ecstasy-related VSWM deficit. Conclusions Ecstasy users were impaired in processing visuospatial information especially under conditions of high processing demand. The results are consistent with ecstasy-related impairment either in the short-term posterior parietal and occipital area store or the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex processes, which augment it under conditions of higher processing demands. Further research is needed to pinpoint the actual source of the ecstasy/polydrug-related VSWM deficits that have been observed here and elsewhere. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6295","Inpatient Buprenorphine Induction With Psilocybin for Opioid Use Disorder.^\nThe proposed study is a double‐blind, controlled investigation of the effect of 1 high‐dose psilocybin (30 mg) session compared to a very low dose session (1 mg) following standard‐of‐care buprenorphine induction on drug abstinence, quality of life, craving, tobacco use, and treatment retention in healthy participants with an active OUD diagnosis. Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions. At the end of the inpatient phase, participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase, during which participants will undergo visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events, clinical status, treatment adherence, and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine. All buprenorphine procedures will be open label and will follow standard‐of‐care practices. This trial utilizes a Bayesian sequential methodology, employing a maximum sample size of 90 participants and calculating Bayes factors (starting at 20 participants and assessed after each 10) to assess evidence for the null and experimental hypotheses, enabling potential early stopping for efficacy or futility based on predetermined thresholds (Bayes factor of 6 and 1/6).

"8519","Glutamatergic deficit and schizophrenia-like negative symptoms: new evidence from ketamine-induced mismatch negativity alterations in healthy male humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major translational approach for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ketamine comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitive and negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudes during ketamine administration are associated with the emergence of schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We examined the impact of ketamine during an MMN paradigm with 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed the psychopathological status using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in healthy male volunteers using a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for source localization. RESULTS: Twenty-four men were included in our analysis. Significant reductions of MMN amplitudes and an increase in all PANSS scores were identified under the ketamine condition. Smaller MMN amplitudes were specifically associated with more pronounced negative symptoms. Source analysis of MMN generators indicated a significantly reduced current source density (CSD) under the ketamine condition in the primary auditory cortex, the posterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyrus. LIMITATIONS: The sample included only men within a tight age range of 20-32 years. CONCLUSION: The MMN might represent a biomarker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia related to an insufficient NMDAR system and could be used to identify patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms due to NMDAR dysfunction.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9038","Visuo-spatial working memory deficits in current and former users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nVerbal working memory and executive deficits have been observed in ecstasy users. The present study sought to establish whether these also extended to visuo-spatial working memory. Thirty-six current ecstasy users, 12 former users (abstinent for at least 6 months) and 31 individuals that had never used ecstasy were tested on a maintenance plus type visuo-spatial working memory task. The task required participants to recall a sequence of specially marked cells in a four-by-four matrix display while at the same time performing a concurrent visual judgement task. Both the current and former user groups registered impairments relative to nonusers. These remained significant following statistical controls for a range of potentially confounding variables including the use of various other drugs during the 3 months prior to testing. Users were unimpaired on a simple spatial span measure suggesting that the deficits observed reflected the executive aspects of the spatial working memory task. Also consistent with executive involvement, statistical controls for measures of verbal working memory performance (computation span) removed half of the ecstasy-related variance in spatial working memory. The possibility that the pattern of results obtained might reflect some general impairment in information processing efficiency is discussed.

"791","Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5679","Variation of drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations based on age and sex: an epidemiological approach based on European emergency departments.^\nOBJECTIVE: To analyse the relative percentage of acute recreational drug toxicity emergency department (ED) presentations involving the main drug groups according to age and sex and investigate different patterns based on sex and age strata. METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males. CONCLUSION: Differences in the drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations according to age and sex may be relevant for developing drug-prevention and education programs for some particular subgroups of the population based on the increased risk of adverse events in specific sex and/or age strata.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"6684","Clinical experience using intranasal ketamine in the treatment of pediatric bipolar disorder/fear of harm phenotype.^\nOBJECTIVES: Intravenous ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert a rapid antidepressant effect in adults with treatment resistant depression. Children with bipolar disorder (BD) often respond poorly to pharmacotherapy, including polypharmacy. A pediatric-onset Fear of Harm (FOH) phenotype has been described, and is characterized by severe clinical features and resistance to accepted treatments for BD. The potential efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine in children with BD with FOH-phenotype were assessed by a systematic retrospective chart review of a case series from the private practice of one of the authors, including cases with clear refractoriness to mood stabilizers, antipsychotics and benzodiazepines. METHODS: A comparison was made between routinely collected symptom measures 1-2 weeks prior to and after the administration of ketamine, in 12 treatment-refractory youth, 10 males 2 females ages 6-19years. RESULTS: Ketamine administration was associated with a substantial reduction in measures of mania, fear of harm and aggression. Significant improvement was observed in mood, anxiety and behavioral symptoms, attention/executive functions, insomnia, parasomnias and sleep inertia. Treatment was generally well-tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Intranasal ketamine administration in treatment-resistant youth with BD-FOH produced marked improvement in all symptomatic dimensions. A rapid, substantial therapeutic response, with only minimal side effects was observed. Formal clinical trials to assess safety and efficacy are warranted.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7419","The harmful health effects of recreational ecstasy: a systematic review of observational evidence.^\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the harmful health effects of taking ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) for recreational purposes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched. Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD). REVIEW METHODS: Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naïve to illegal drugs (drug-naïve controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Methods: Our meta-analysis included previous studies that used ketamine in order to induce psychotic experiences in healthy participants and that recorded the MMN either by electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography. Results: The analysis revealed systematic MMN amplitude decreases and, with a lower effect size, latency increases after ketamine administration. However, the observed amplitude and latency effects did not vary between duration and frequency deviants. Conclusion: Across studies, there is no evidence that ketamine effects on the MMN are larger for duration than frequency deviants. Significance: Our findings tentatively suggest that, in addition to an NMDA receptor hypofunction, other factors might contribute to the sometimes observed pattern of impaired MMN responses to duration deviants, but unimpaired MMN responses to frequency deviants in schizophrenia.

"1385","A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

"2483","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2783","MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.^\nSocial decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We administered 100 mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment × opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"3598","The Efficacy of Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis.^\nBackground: The use of psychedelic compounds to treat psychiatric disorders has become a very significant topic of research over the past several years. Psilocybin has risen to prominence as one of the most studied among these psychedelic compounds. Multiple trials have already shown that it can be a safe and efficacious treatment for various medical conditions. This study intends to perform a meta-analysis of data reported in clinical trials studying psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety. Methods: Articles were searched, screened, and ultimately selected using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was collected from commonly used psychometric tests that measured mood and anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated by comparing scores in these tests at baseline and control to experimental groups. Sub-group analysis was performed to assess psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety during short, medium, and long-term time frames. Results: Statistical significance was achieved in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to controls in multiple subgroups. Heterogeneity of the effect sizes was calculated using an I2 value which showed low to moderate values. Multiple tools were used to assess publication bias, and none could be found. Conclusion: Although research on psilocybin continues to show promise, the evidence is still at a preliminary phase, and more trials need to be conducted with larger patient populations over longer periods for psilocybin to potentially be approved in a community setting.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6000","A Test of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in People With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in response to a traumatic event or events. It is most likely to occur following an event involving perceived personal threat, such as rape or physical assault. PTSD is clearly a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering and accounts for a significant portion of health care costs. This study will examine whether two sessions of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered to participants with PTSD, and whether MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, when compared with placebo‐assisted therapy, will reduce PTSD symptoms after each session and two months after the second session. MDMA is a substance possessing unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA has been hypothesized to represent a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled (illegal) and cannot be used outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD. This study will examine MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in twenty people ages 18 to 70 with PTSD either related to crime victimization or combat, when combat‐related PTSD lasts no longer than five years, and that has not gotten better after psychotherapy and treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, such as Paxil). This study lasts three to four months. Participants attend up to fourteen (14) ordinary (non‐drug) psychotherapy sessions with the investigators as well as two eight hour long experimental (MDMA or placebo) sessions and one MDMA session. People taking part in this study cannot take any psychiatric medication during the study period. People will either get 125 mg MDMA or placebo ""by chance,"" as by coin‐toss, with twelve of twenty (60%) getting MDMA during each experimental session, and eight of twenty (40%) getting placebo. Two to two and a half hours later, if you and the investigators agree it is alright, you will take a second supplemental, dose of MDMA or placebo. The supplemental dose will be half the size of the first dose. The same investigators conducting non‐drug therapy sessions conduct the experimental sessions. All participants are required to stay the night at the clinic after each experimental session. Participants meet with the investigators for a non‐drug assisted therapy session the day after each experimental session. A third MDMA session in this placebo‐controlled stage of the study will only be for people who received MDMA in the first two sessions. PTSD symptoms are measured at the start of the study, four days after each experimental session, and finally two months after the second experimental session. People are tested on memory and problem solving when they first enter the study and again two months after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are measured to see whether there are any changes in symptoms during the study, and tests of thinking, memory and problem‐solving are meant to spot any changes that could be due to MDMA or MDMA‐assisted therapy. Participants who recieved MDMA who complete the final evaluation, and upon discussion with the investigators, will undergo a third MDMA session. The third session will happen approximately two months after the second experimental session This session is ""open label,"" meaning that they and the investigators will both know they are receiving MDMA. It will be followed by one psychotherapy session a day after this session and two additional psychotherapy sessions in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms will be measured again two months after the third MDMA session. Participants who received placebo and complete the final evaluation two months after the second experimental procedure will be given an opportunity to take part in an open‐label continuation of the study where they will receive an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA in up to three experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Participants in this open‐label continuation will act as their own controls. The open‐label continuation lasts three months and will involve nine more visits with the investigators, including the two experimental sessions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6044","Psilocybin-facilitated Smoking Cessation Treatment: a Pilot Study.^\nOne of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. We propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008). It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine‐dependent cigarette smokers, who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open‐label pilot‐study with no control condition. Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=40), or nicotine patch (n=40) treatment. Participants will receive a 13‐week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day‐long psilocybin session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10‐week course of nicotine patch treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, 50 of these participants (25 per treatment condition) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain‐based mechanisms associated with these treatments. Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin session after completing the 6‐month follow‐up meeting.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"558","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^\nOBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"602","Repeated subcutaneous esketamine administration for depressive symptoms and pain relief in a terminally ill cancer patient: A case report.^\nBACKGROUND: Depressive disorders are common among cancer patients. Ketamine can quickly relieve depression, and its subcutaneous administration appears to be as effective as and probably safer than its standard intravenous administration. Herein, we report a case verifying the antidepressant effect of a subcutaneous esketamine formulation. CASE PRESENTATION: A 65-year-old male with metastatic abdominal tumor reported sadness, weight loss, fatigue, hopelessness, insomnia, inattention, and reduced motivation. His scores on the visual analogical scale for pain and Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale were 8/10 and 30/60, respectively. POSSIBLE COURSES OF ACTION: Monoaminergic antidepressants are effective, but their response is slow for end-of-life care. FORMULATION OF A PLAN: Esketamine was preferred because it possibly contributes to pain relief. It can repeatedly be infused intravenously, but was subcutaneously administered twice a week for safety reasons. OUTCOME: The patient showed continuous mood improvement, achieving depression remission on day 7. Pain relief was observed but without stability. His vital signs remained stable, and he remained calm, without major complaints. LESSONS FROM THE CASE: Repeated subcutaneous esketamine injections are possibly safe and effective in pain and depression relief in palliative care cancer patients. VIEW ON RESEARCH PROBLEMS, OBJECTIVES, OR QUESTIONS GENERATED BY THE CASE: Placebo-controlled studies with similar cases are needed to establish efficacy and safety.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Sex (biological) and gender differences in therapeutic effects for any new intervention is an important consideration, however, the differential efficacy, safety and tolerability of ketamine in males versus females remains underexplored. The objective of the present systematic review is to identify and qualitatively synthesize all published clinical studies relevant to the sex differential effects of ketamine for mood disorders. A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo from inception until January 20, 2021, yielded 27 reports including 1715 patients (742 males and 973 females) that met inclusion criteria. Results from the vast majority of studies (88.8%) do not support significant sex differences in antidepressant response, tolerability or safety of ketamine. Nine (33.3%) of the reports included a bioanalytical component in the analysis and only one reported on sex differences. Evidence from the present review does not support clinically or statistically significant sex differences in therapeutic effects with ketamine. Nevertheless, future studies should continue to consider sex and biological sex differences in study design and data analytic plans.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients.

"863","Multiple drug ingestion by ecstasy abusers in the United States.^\nThe abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9). In addition to MDMA/MDA, the most commonly identified drug groups (%) were cannabis (THCCOOH) (61.6%); amphetamine/ methamphetamine (38.4%); benzoylecgonine (30.8%); diazepam-related (9.6%); opiates (7.1%); alprazolam (5.6%); and others (5.6%).

"1109","A voxel-based PET investigation of the long-term effects of ""ecstasy"" consumption on brain serotonin transporters.^\nObjective: Recent functional imaging studies have reported evidence of alterations in the serotonergic system induced by 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), or ""Ecstasy."" However, these studies have often been limited by small sample size, lack of tracer selectivity, unreliable assessment of MDMA doses, insufficiently matched comparison groups, or region-of-interest analysis. Method: Positron emission tomography (PET) using the specific serotonin transporter ligand [ 11C](+)McN5652 was performed in 117 subjects: 30 current MDMA users, 29 former MDMA users, 29 drug-naive comparison subjects, and 29 users of drugs other than MDMA (polydrug comparison subjects). Self-assessment of drug history was checked by analyzing hair samples. Local serotonin transporter availability was computed by a regularized reference tissue approach. Voxel-based comparison of serotonin transporter availability was performed using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 99). Results: Serotonin transporter availability in current MDMA users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon, thalamus, left caudate, hippocampus, occipital cortex, temporal lobes, and posterior cingulate gyrus compared with all other groups. Reduction was more pronounced in female than in male subjects. There was no significant difference of serotonin transporter availability among former MDMA users and the drug-naive and polydrug comparison subjects. A negative correlation between serotonin transporter availability and mean MDMA dose was found in occipital visual areas and in the left precentral sulcus of current MDMA users. In addition, there was a significant positive correlation between the serotonin transporter availability and the MDMA abstention period in brainstem and in the basal forebrain in all MDMA users. Conclusions: These findings support the hypothesis of MDMA-induced protracted alterations of the serotonergic system and indicate that the reduced availability of serotonin transporter, as measured by PET, might be reversible.

OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Recreational use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is widespread. The present study aimed to examine both the acute and residual effects of this drug on users' mood and cognitive function. Design and participants. A parallel group design was used to compare 12 participants who reported having taken MDMA with 12 participants who reported having consumed only alcohol, on the relevant night (day 1). These same participants were then re-assessed the following day (day 2) and again mid-week (day 5). Findings. Acute effects of MDMA broadly replicated previous findings. MDMA users rated elevated mood on day 1 but significantly low mood on day 5, at which point some participants scored within the range for clinical depression. In contrast, the alcohol group showed less pronounced changes, which followed a U-shaped curve over days with the lowest point being day 2. The MDMA group also showed significant impairments on an attentional/working memory task, compared with alcohol users. Conclusions. Weekend use of MDMA may lead to depressed mood mid-week. Possible mechanisms underlying the findings are discussed in terms of temporary depletion of serotonin, serotonergic neurotoxity and psychological aspects of mood change.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time.

"1787","Low dose ketamine infusion for comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder and chronic pain: A randomized double-blind clinical trial.^\nObjective: To date, treatment options (i.e. psychotherapy, antidepressant medications) for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), are relatively few, and considering their limited efficacy, novel therapies have gained interest among researchers and treatment providers alike. Among patients with chronic pain (CP) about one third experience comorbid PTSD, which further complicates their already challenging pharmacological regimens. Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD, and in treatment of CP, however they have not been studied in comorbid population and under rigorous control conditions. Methods: We compared the effects of a single dose of either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or ketorolac (15 mg) over a 40-minute of IV infusion in CP patients with and without PTSD, in double blind, randomized study. Measures were collected before, during, one day and seven days after the infusion. A planned sample size of 40 patients randomly assigned to treatment order was estimated to provide 80% power to detect a hypothesized treatment difference after the infusion. Main Outcome and Measures: The primary outcome measures were change in PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R) and Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) for pain administered by a study clinician 24 hours post infusion. Secondary outcome measures included Impact of Event Scale–Revised (IES-R), VAS and Brief Pain Inventory (Short Form) for pain 1 week after the infusion. Results: Both treatments offered comparable improvement of PTSD and CP symptoms that persisted for 7 days after the infusion. Patients with comorbid PTSD and CP experienced less dissociative side effects compared to the CP group. Surprisingly, ketorolac infusion resulted in dissociative symptoms in CP patients only. Conclusions: This first prospective study comparing effects of subanesthetic ketamine versus ketorolac infusions for comorbid PTSD and CP, suggests that both ketamine and ketorolac might offer meaningful and durable response for both PTSD and CP symptoms.

"2034","The effectiveness, safety and tolerability of ketamine for depression in adolescents and older adults: A systematic review.^\nThe majority of antidepressant medication trials have focused on adult populations (ages 18-65), with much less research in older and younger populations. Moreover, key differences in the efficacy and safety of antidepressants have been identified between these age groups. Ketamine has emerged as a promising new treatment for treatment resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this review is to summarize and synthesize the extant literature on the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of ketamine for depression in special age populations (age ≤18 and ≥ 60). Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed, searching EMBASE, PsycInfo, and PubMed from inception through July 2020. Studies reporting the use of any ketamine formulation with variable routes of administration to treat clinically diagnosed depression in adolescents or older adults were included. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis and ten observed rapid (≤2 week latency) antidepressant effects following ketamine treatments, with better outcomes following larger, repeated doses, and in open-label rather than blinded settings. Two case reports in adolescents assessed measures of suicidal ideation and both found ketamine to effectuate rapid anti-suicidal effects. Ketamine appears to be safe and well-tolerated in adolescents and older adults. The small quantity, high heterogeneity, and generally low quality of available studies precludes statistical syntheses and significantly limits the strength of our conclusions. Preliminary proof-of-concept studies are promising, however, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still required to ascertain effectiveness, safety and tolerability in these groups.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2245","Psilocybin induces aberrant prediction error processing for tactile mismatch responses.^\nBackground: The skin as the body's largest organ is our first contact point with the environment encoding information of many different sources as well as providing a sense of boundaries and the Self/Non‐Self discrimination – thus forming a backdrop of all perceptual experiences [1]. Predictive codes integrating bodily states and sensory inputs may give rise to self‐awareness and a sense of agency. Distortions in these processes have been linked to psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenic delusions [2]. However, the relationship between altered tactile prediction error (PE) processing and distorted self‐experience and its underlying neuropharmacology have never been empirically studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the preferential 5‐HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self‐experience, on the processing of tactile mismatch responses by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: In this cross‐over, double‐blind, within‐subject, randomized and placebo‐controlled study, fifteen healthy participants (8 males, and 7 females, aged between 20–40 years) received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight p. o. oral administration of the 5‐HT2A/1A agonist Psi. Participants completed a roving oddball task while undergoing fMRI 85 minutes after Psi/Pla administration during peak of subjective Psi effects. To induce tactile mismatch responses, trains of stimuli switched randomly between high (double pulse) and low (single pulse) intensity after a variable number of 3 to 7 repetitions, generating an unpredictable sequence. The first stimulus of each train was modelled as the “Deviant (D)"" and the third repetition of each train as “Standard"" (S). All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using a MR‐safe electrode and a constant current stimulator (Digitimer, DS7AH). The fMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in the SPM12 software package. The dependent variables were the fMRI BOLD contrasts D > S. Subjective effects were measured using the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). 5D‐ASC scores were analyzed by using a repeated‐measures ANOVA design with treatment condition (Pla and Psi) and scale as within‐subject factors. Results: In response to unpredicted stimuli significant decreases in brain activity after Psi administration were detected for the D > S contrast in areas previously implicated in body awareness and tactile deviancy processing: thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, midcingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Further, Psi produced robust perceptual alterations of bodily awareness and self‐experience assessed with the rating scale 5D‐ASC. Conclusion: This study shows that Psi alters the integration of tactile stimuli through aberrant PE signalling, potentially the underlying mechanism of Psi‐induced alterations of self and body‐experience. Furthermore, it points to the important role of the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes in the processes of self‐experience. This finding may be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders compromised by distorted self‐experience.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"2431","Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder Measured Up to 10 Days After Ketamine Administration.^\nBACKGROUND: The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). METHODS: Data were drawn from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants (33 with MDD and 25 HCs) who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. The DMN was defined using seed-based correlation and was compared across groups and scans. RESULTS: In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. This change was reversed after 10 days and did not appear in either of the placebo scans. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2539","Efficacy of intravenous ketamine for treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder: a randomized clinical trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: Few pharmacotherapies have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), a chronic and disabling condition. OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control, midazolam, conducted at a single site (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York). Forty-one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales, and adverse effect measures, including the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P = .02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.

"2627","The Association Between the Negative Effects Attributed to Ecstasy Use and Measures of Cognition and Mood Among Users.^\nIn self reports, abstinent ecstasy/polydrug users claim that they experience certain ongoing affective and psychological changes including elevated anxiety, arousal, and depression. In addition, various aspects of cognition (e.g., everyday memory, reasoning, executive functioning) appear to be affected. The present paper investigated the link between these two psychological sequelae. Ninety-five ecstasy/polydrug users completed tests of reasoning, intelligence, information processing speed, executive functioning, and everyday memory. Affect was measured via a mood adjective checklist. Adverse effects attributed to ecstasy were measured via responses to adjectives reflecting changes in users since they started using the drug. In addition, indicators of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness were obtained. Users attributed a number of adverse effects to ecstasy, namely heightened irritability, depression, paranoia, and deteriorating health. Adverse effects were significantly and negatively correlated with aspects of intelligence, everyday memory, and sleep quality. Length of use of ecstasy use was positively correlated with adverse effects. While many users attribute a number of adverse affects to their use of ecstasy, it remains unclear whether these self-perceptions are a corollary of the psychopharmacological effects of the drug or reflect factors which in fact predate its use. © 2009 American Psychological Association.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2957","Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

"3237","Efficacy and Safety of Ketamine in the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.^\nPURPOSE: Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist with strong analgesic properties. Its addition to the treatment of neuropathic pain may reduce pain intensity and improve overall quality of life. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to investigate the addition of ketamine to the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Eighteen (18) randomized controlled trials including 706 participants were included for further analysis. RESULTS: Ketamine addition to standard treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain intensity at one week after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -2.14, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.63; p<0.00001) and after 30 days after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -1.68, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.12; p<0.00001) and a statistically significant increase in discomfort (RR 4.06; 95% CI 1.18 to 13.95; p=0.03), and psychedelic effects (RR 4.94; 95% CI 2.76 to 8.84; p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant pain reduction by adding ketamine to the treatment of chronic NP when compared to the standard treatment. However, such pain reduction comes at the expense of adverse outcomes, especially psychedelic effects related to the administration of ketamine. However, the overall quality of certainty of evidence is low due to the clinical heterogeneity among the intervention characteristics of the trials analyzed (different administration routes, dosing regimen, therapy durations, different clinical characteristics of the population investigated). Future large multi-centered trials are necessary to confirm or not the results of the present review.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"3661","Incidence and patterns of polydrug use and craving for ecstasy in regular ecstasy users: An ecological momentary assessment study.^\nBackground: Previous studies employing retrospective assessments methods found that regular ecstasy users frequently use alcohol, marihuana and other drugs in combination with ecstasy. Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a ""natural history"" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. © 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"4326","LSD use in the United States: Trends, correlates, and a typology of us.^\nBackground: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in LSD. This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002–2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002−2005 to .72 % 2015−2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12). Our findings also indicate several correlates of LSD use including higher levels of education (college degrees: AOR = 1.62, 95 % CI = 1.23, 2.13), not being married (divorced or separated, AOR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.44, 3.73, and have never been married, AOR = 5.67, f 95 % CI = 4.09, 7.86), as well as higher levels of antisocial behavior (having been arrested AOR = 3.20, 95 % CI = 2.50, 4.09) and comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders (serious psychological distress, AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI = 2.05, 2.80). Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"4506","LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nRationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4635","Inhibition of MDMA-induced increase in cortisol does not prevent acute impairment of verbal memory.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of ± 3,4 metylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to block the MDMA-induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo-controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pre-treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. RESULTS: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA-induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA-induced memory deficit from happening. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that MDMA-induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA-induced memory impairments.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4640","Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4682","Ketamine activates psychosis and alters limbic blood flow in schizophrenia.^\nThe non-competitive NMDA antagonist ketamine, given to schizophrenic individuals in subanesthetic doses, produced a short-lived, discrete activation of their psychotic symptoms, which had striking similarities to symptoms of their usual psychotic episodes. To further study this psychotomimetic property of ketamine, we administered 0.3 mg kg-1 of the drug to schizophrenic individuals during a [15O] water cerebral blood flow study. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H2(15)O and positron emission tomography (PET) before and after ketamine administration to identify regions of flow change, rCBF was increased in anterior cingulate cortex and was reduced in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex (lingual and fusiform gyri).

"4841","Ninety-six hour ketamine infusion with co-administered clonidine for treatment-resistant depression: A pilot randomised controlled trial.^\nObjectives We examined the feasibility of a high-dose, 96-h infusion of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression. Methods Ten participants were randomised to receive a 96-h ketamine infusion, titrated as tolerated to a target rate of 0.6 mg/kg/h, while 10 received a 40-min ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg). Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6 mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion. Most participants tolerated the infusion well, with minimal psychotomimetic symptoms or blood pressure elevation despite achieving high ketamine concentrations (mean 424 ng/ml for 96-h arm, 156 ng/ml for 40-min arm). There was no rebound hypertension upon discontinuing clonidine. Rapid and sustained improvement in depressive symptoms was observed in both study groups. Higher ketamine concentration was associated with sustained antidepressant response, and was not with greater psychotomimetic side effects, in the 96-h arm. Conclusions This study provides evidence for the feasibility of prolonged ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression. Co-administration of clonidine appeared to mitigate ketamine's psychotomimetic effects. Further study is required to investigate the extent to which prolonged ketamine infusions could provide both rapid and sustained improvements in treatment-resistant depression.

"4884","Group format psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions: Observations and impressions from the HOPE trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated significant promise as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress associated with serious medical illness and has generally been employed on an individual basis, which presents challenges for scaling and resource availability. There are also compelling theoretical reasons to suggest that group-based formats-if utilized in a thoughtful fashion-might offer unique or enhanced therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or populations. The HOPE trial is an IRB-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study of psi-locybin enhanced group therapy in patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder associated with a cancer diagnosis completed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) in Salt Lake City, Utah (HOPE: A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer). We report here quali-tative survey-based data, impressions, and suggestions for group-based psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions based on our observations to inform future studies. Methods: Patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder with an underlying cancer diagnosis were recruited from HCI by referral from oncology providers, palliative care, and social work. Following screening and consenting, 4-6 partici-pants per cohort (with three total cohorts) were enrolled in a protocol involving 3 120 min group preparatory sessions, a single high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and 3 subsequent group integration sessions. Primary clinical outcomes are still in process of data collection and analysis. Qualitative data was gathered from patient written reports and a survey administered at 2 weeks post intervention. Qualitative reports were also gathered from the therapist team at a post-study group process session. Findings: We report here results from a qualitative survey of participant experiences with group format study design, as well as impressions and guidelines for group format and group psychotherapeutic process to inform other studies pursuing group-based interventions in psychedelic therapy.

"4943","Mental disorders in ecstasy users: A prospective-longitudinal investigation.^\nObjectives: To investigate the relationship between ecstasy use and mental disorders in a representative sample of adolescents and young adults. Method: Data for this investigation were drawn from the Early Developmental Stages of Psychopathology (EDSP) study, an epidemiological-longitudinal study in which 14-24 year-olds were examined prospectively over a period of about 4 years. Results are based on N=2462 participants who completed the whole study period and for whom drug use behavior could be determined. Results: (1) Ecstasy users, compared with non-users, were at significantly increased risk of DSM-IV substance related disorders, including alcohol use disorders (52.6 vs. 15.6%; OR=5.6, 95% CI=3.8-8.1). Further, ecstasy users also had a higher risk of alcohol use disorders, when compared with users of other illicit substances (52.6 vs. 40.3%; OR=1.7, 95% CI=1.1-2.4). (2) Ecstasy users had significantly higher rates for almost all DSM-IV mental disorders examined when compared with non-users (any non-substance use disorder: 68.7 vs. 44.5%; OR=3.1, 95% CI=2.1-4.4) and compared with users of other illicit drugs (any non substance use disorder: 68.7 vs. 55.5%; OR=1.8, 95% CI=1.2-2.6). (3) Ecstasy users also reported significantly higher rates of prescription medicine use, though they did not use more medical services than non-drug users. (4) Analyses of temporal patterns of ecstasy use and disorder onset revealed that the first use of ecstasy was secondary to the onset of DSM-IV mental disorders in the majority of cases. Still, subjects with mental disorders at baseline also showed a significantly increased risk for initiation of ecstasy use during the 4-year follow-up period. Conclusions: Care should be taken in cross sectional studies in interpreting mental disorder signs and symptoms merely as a consequence of ecstasy use, as ecstasy use might be associated with the use of multiple substances, and onset of mental disorder is more likely to precede rather than to follow use of ecstasy and related substances. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

"4961","Acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients during LSD-assisted psychotherapy.^\nBackground: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is increasingly used in clinical research. The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects. Additionally, acute effects of LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales (VASs), the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). Results: In healthy subjects, LSD acutely and dose‐dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, trust and closeness to others on the VASs. On the 5D‐ASC, LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg. LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) had similar effects on the 5D‐ASC and induced similar mystical‐type experiences in the MEQ in healthy subjects and patients (alone and in group settings). Conclusions: LSD has acute empathogenic effects that may be beneficial in psychotherapy. Preliminary findings indicate that LSD produced largely comparable acute alterations in consciousness and mystical‐type experiences in healthy subjects in an experimental setting and in psychiatric patients in different treatment settings.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4967","Autonomic, cardiovascular, and endocrine effects of LSD in healthy subjects.^\nIntroduction: LSD is used recreationally worldwide and there is renewed interest in using LSD in clinical psychiatric research and practice. However, there is limited data on the somatic and endocrine effects of LSD in humans. Method: LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over study. Cardiostimulant effects (blood pressure and heart rate), autonomic effects (body temperature and pupillary function), endocrine effects, and adverse effects were repeatedly assessed. Results: LSD induced positive mood, visual perceptual alterations, and audio‐visual synesthesia lasting for 12h. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD elevated the plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine but not norepinephrine. LSD impaired psychomotor performance (balance) and produced adverse side effects (difficulty concentrating, headache, exhaustion, dizziness) up to 24 h, which completely subsided within 72 h. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: The hallucinogen LSD produces significant sympathomimetic effects. The LSD‐induced increase in cortisol and prolactin is consistent with LSD's serotonergic properties. The cardiostimulant properties of LSD need to be considered in patients with hypertension or heart disease.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4988","Use of ketamine and esketamine for depression: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.^\nPURPOSE: To summarize the evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of ketamine and esketamine for depression. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CRD until November 2020. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the use of ketamine and esketamine in adult patients with depression. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to appraise the quality of included reviews. RESULTS: A total of 118 records were identified, and 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Compared to control, ketamine improved the clinical response at 40 min to 1 week and clinical remission at 80 min to 72 h, and esketamine improved both outcomes at 2 h to 4 weeks. Ketamine and esketamine also had a beneficial effect on the depression scales score and suicidality. For adverse events, oral ketamine did not show significant change compared to control, while intranasal esketamine showed difference for any events, such as dissociation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, and vertigo. Most reviews were classified as ""critically low quality,"" and none of them declared the source of funding of the primary studies and assessed the potential impact of risk of bias in primary studies. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and esketamine showed a significant antidepressant action within a few hours or days after administration; however, the long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. In addition, the methodological quality of the reviews was usually critically low, which may indicate the need for higher quality evidence in relation to the theme.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5215","Chronic opioid therapy modifies QST changes after ketamine infusion in chronic pain patients.^\nThe long-term effects of opioids on sensitization processes are believed to be mediated through the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) changes observed after a ketamine infusion have been previously described but the effect that chronic opioids will have is not known. The results of this prospective randomized factorial trial compared the thermal QST changes observed after a .05 mg/kg ketamine infusion or a saline placebo in chronic pain subjects who were either opioid-naive or were chronically using opioids for chronic noncancer pain are presented. No baseline QST differences were noted between the 4 groups at baseline. Comparison of changes preinfusion with postinfusion QST measurements resulted in decreased average change in temporal summation response between opioid subjects who received a placebo compared with those who received a ketamine infusion (−5.22, SD = 9.96 vs 13.81, SD = 19.55; P = .004). Additionally, the average change in temporal summation was decreased among subjects who received a ketamine infusion and were not chronically using opioids compared with subjects who were using chronic opioids and received a placebo infusion (−1.91, SD = 13.25 vs 13.81, SD = 19.55; P = .007). The results indicate that low-dose ketamine infusions produce subtle changes in QST phenotypes that are modified by the chronic use of opioids. This illustrates the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of ketamine in the setting of chronic opioid use.

"5524","Simultaneous EEG/fMRI recorded during ketamine infusion in patients with major depressive disorder.^\nA single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine rapidly alleviates the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have investigated the acute effects of ketamine on the BOLD pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) response and EEG spectra. In a randomised, double-blind, active placebo-controlled crossover trial, resting-state simultaneous EEG/fMRI was collected during infusion of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil) in 30 participants with MDD. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores showed a significant antidepressant effect of ketamine compared to placebo (69% response rate). phMRI analyses showed BOLD signal increases in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices and sensitivity of the decrease in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) BOLD signal to noise correction. EEG spectral analysis showed increased theta, high beta, low and high gamma power, and decreased delta, alpha, and low beta power with differing time-courses. Low beta and high gamma power time courses explained significant variance in the BOLD signal. Interestingly, the variance explained by high gamma power was significantly associated with non-response to ketamine, but significant associations were not found for other neurophysiological markers when noise correction was implemented. The results suggest that the decrease in sgACC BOLD signal is potentially noise and unrelated to ketamine's antidepressant effect, highlighting the importance of noise correction and multiple temporal regressors for phMRI analyses. The lack of effects significantly associated with antidepressant response suggests the phMRI methodology employed was unable to detect such effects, the effect sizes are relatively small, or that other processes, e.g. neural plasticity, underlie ketamine's antidepressant effect.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5641","A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

"6302","Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^\nSemantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6558","The effects of a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine on human selective attention.^\nTested the hypothesis that a sub-anaesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, ketamine, would induce psychophysiological and selective attention anomalies in healthy Ss that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg/kg ketamine. Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard (80%) and deviant tones (20%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear. Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy Ss that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"6679","Human pharmacology of mephedrone: a dose-finding pilot study.^\nAims: Mephedrone is a synthetic cathinone included in the “Novel Psychoactive Substances” group. European epidemiological data showed a high prevalence of use. There are not experimental data in humans of the pharmacological effects of mephedrone. Objective was to obtain preliminary data on the effects of mephedrone and doses for future investigations. Methods: Nine healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants, participated as outpatients in three different experimental sessions, in which one of the substances was administered each day. They received single oral doses of mephedrone (n = 3, 50 mg, 100mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and MDMA 100 mg). Drugs were administered doubleblind, and randomised (lower doses were allocated before higher doses for safety reasons in case of 150mg and 200 mg). Study variables included: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects (visual analog scales‐VAS, ARCI‐ 49 item short form, VESSPA questionnaire), and blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetics. Results: Mephedrone produced effects at 150 and 200 mg, with dose‐related increases of blood pressure, heart rate and pupil diameter (but not temperature). Mephedrone produced more intense effects than MDMA. Mephedrone induced pleasurable effects (ARCI‐MBG, VAS “good effects”, VAS “liking”), and mild changes in perceptions but not hallucinations. Conclusions: Mephedrone produces dose‐related effects in vital parameters and pleasurable subjective effects. Its pharmacologic profile is similar to MDMA and other psychostimulants.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6740","The effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on verbal memory in normal volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists have been reported to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans, including memory impairments. Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the behavioral effects associated with ketamine and suggests that ketamine decreases verbal memory performance by interfering with early consolidation processes.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7041","Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^\nMethylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users. Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry (i.e., methylone is a β-keto analog of MDMA) and mechanisms of action. Currently, the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

"7164","Could ketamine be the answer to treating treatment-resistant major depressive disorder?.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a common, serious, debilitating condition affecting 350 million people worldwide, which remains to be unsatisfactorily treated with 53% of patients still complaining of symptoms after completing their courses with the correct dosage. Ketamine, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2019, is a potential treatment option for those recalcitrant cases. The mechanism of ketamine is not fully understood, but as type it is classified as anN-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist, and can be given intravenously, intranasally and orally. It is used to treat treatment-resistant depression, depression associated with suicidal ideation, mood and anxiety disorders and depressions associated with either type of bipolar disorder. Although ketamine is considered relatively safe, several side effects have been reported with the major ones being psychiatric in the form of worsening mood, anxiety and agitation; psychotomimetic in the form of dissociation, perceptual disturbance and abnormal sensations; cardiovascular in the form of increased blood pressure and increased heart rate; and neurological in the form of headache and dizziness. Ketamine is still not approved worldwide for usage in patients with treatment-resistant MDD, but if it is approved sometime in the future with relatively fewer side effects, it is expected to significantly save millions of dollars spent yearly on patients with treatment-resistant depression and that will lift this major burden off the shoulders of healthcare professionals. This study was designed to measure the effects of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, on patients with treatment-resistant MDD and to analyse the concept that makes it different and relatively safer than other major antidepressants like selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors and TCAs (tricyclic antidepressants).","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7379","Serotonergic hallucinogens and recognition of facial emotion expressions: a systematic review of the literature.^\nBACKGROUND: Recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a key aspect of social cognition. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with deficits in REFE, and anxiolytics and antidepressants reverse these deficits. Recent studies have shown that serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], and mescaline) have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, but their effects on REFE are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans. METHODS: Studies published in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases until 19 October 2018 which analyzed the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans were included. RESULTS: Of the 62 studies identified, 8 studies were included. Included studies involved the administration of a single or a few doses of LSD or psilocybin, and most trials were randomized and controlled with placebo. LSD and psilocybin reduced the recognition of negative emotions in most studies and modulated amygdala activity to these stimuli, which was correlated with antidepressive effects in patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogens reduced the recognition of negative emotions by modulating amygdala activity. Despite the small sample sizes, results suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens show promising beneficial effects on deficits in REFE.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7509","Brain entropy and neurotrophic molecular markers accompanying clinical improvement after ketamine: Preliminary evidence in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Current theory suggests that treatment-resistant depression (TRD) involves impaired neuroplasticity resulting in cognitive and neural rigidity, and that clinical improvement may require increasing brain flexibility and adaptability. AIMS: In this hypothesis-generating study, we sought to identify preliminary evidence of brain flexibility correlates of clinical change within the context of an open-label ketamine trial in adolescents with TRD, focusing on two promising candidate markers of neural flexibility: (a) entropy of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signals; and (b) insulin-stimulated phosphorylation of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and glycogen synthase-3-beta (GSK3β) in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. METHODS: We collected resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging data and blood samples from 13 adolescents with TRD before and after a series of six ketamine infusions over 2 weeks. Usable pre/post ketamine data were available from 11 adolescents for imaging and from 10 adolescents for molecular signaling. We examined correlations between treatment response and changes in the central and peripheral flexibility markers. RESULTS: Depression reduction correlated with increased nucleus accumbens entropy. Follow-up analyses suggested that physiological changes were associated with treatment response. In contrast to treatment non-responders (n=6), responders (n=5) showed greater increase in nucleus accumbens entropy after ketamine, together with greater post-treatment insulin/mTOR/GSK3β signaling. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide preliminary evidence that changes in neural flexibility may underlie symptom relief in adolescents with TRD following ketamine. Future research with adequately powered samples is needed to confirm resting-state entropy and insulin-stimulated mTOR and GSK3β as brain flexibility markers and candidate targets for future clinical trials.

"7914","Effects of cannabis use on antidepressant treatment response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine.^\nThe present letter presents a retrospective analysis of Veterans treated with these modalities at the VA San Diego Medical Center between 2017 and 2023 and analyzed whether cannabis moderated the antidepressant effects. We found a group difference only in age for the rTMS and ketamine groups (cannabis users were on average younger (p < 0.05)). We next examined whether cannabis use affected changes in PHQ-9 scores during ketamine treatments, revealing a main effect of treatment (F (4, 510) = 21.6, p < 0.0001), with a mean reduction of 4.4 points on the PHQ-9 (CI 2.7–6.1). There was no main effect of cannabis use (F (1, 118) = 0.58, p = 0.45) nor a significant group x time interaction (F (7, 759) = 0.36, p = 0.93). Non-cannabis users showed a 4.5 point reduction (CI 2.539–6.407) while cannabis users showed a 4.3 point reduction (CI 0.7802–7.917). Our study limitations include a modest sample, a unique population of Veterans that may not generalize, and a non-randomized uncontrolled analysis. Our study strengths include results that generalize across two treatments (ketamine and rTMS), and a naturalistic design without obvious bias. Finally, this is currently the largest data on the effects of cannabis on treatment outcomes of ketamine and rTMS.

"9163","Ecstasy use in New Zealand: Findings from the 1998 and 2001 National Drug Surveys.^\nAims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives. There was little evidence to suggest ecstasy use was limited to high-income-earning professionals. © NZMA.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]"
"9611","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.
