A recent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) comparison of past MDMA users to non-MDMA-using controls revealed increased spatial extent and amplitude of activation in the supplementary motor area during motor tasks (Karageorgiou et al., 2009). Blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) data from that study were reanalyzed for intraregional coherence and for inter-regional temporal correlations between time series, as functional connectivity. METHODS: Fourteen MDMA users and ten controls reporting similar non-MDMA abuse performed finger taps during fMRI. Fourteen motor pathway regions plus a pontine raph\u00e9 region were examined. Coherence was expressed as percent of voxels positively correlated with an intraregional index voxel. Functional connectivity was determined using wavelet correlations. RESULTS: Intraregional thalamic coherence was significantly diminished at low frequencies in MDMA users compared to controls (p=0.009). Inter-regional functional connectivity was significantly weaker for right thalamo - left caudate (p=0.002), right thalamo - left thalamus (p=0.007), right caudate - right postcentral (p=0.007) and right supplementary motor area - right precentral gyrus (p=0.011) region pairs compared to controls. When stratified by lifetime exposure, significant negative associations were observed between cumulative MDMA use and functional connectivity in seven other region-pairs, while only one region-pair showed a positive association. CONCLUSIONS: Reported prior MDMA use was associated with deficits in BOLD intraregional coherence and inter-regional functional connectivity, even among functionally robust pathways involving motor regions. This suggests that MDMA use is associated with long-lasting effects on brain neurophysiology beyond the cognitive domain."}

Initial Ecstasy use frequently involved polydrug use, including alcohol (50.4%). In terms of their current use, 47.5% of respondents were considered heavy Ecstasy users (using on 10 or more separate occasions in the last 90 days). White respondents, those who used more than one pill during their initial use, and those who used again within one month after their initial use were more likely to be current heavy Ecstasy users. Women, those who waited a longer time between initial and subsequent Ecstasy use, and those who considered themselves in the upper SES bracket were less likely to be current heavy Ecstasy users. A better understanding of initial and current Ecstasy use patterns, including polydrug use, is essential for effective prevention and intervention efforts."}

In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

Inhalation of vapor from toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT has become popular in naturalistic settings as a treatment of mental health problems or as a means for spiritual exploration. However, knowledge of the effects of 5-MeO-DMT in humans is limited. AIMS: The first objective of this study was to assess sub-acute and long-term effects of inhaling vapor from dried toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT on affect and cognition. The second objective was to assess whether any changes were associated with the psychedelic experience. METHODS: Assessments at baseline, within 24\u00a0h and 4\u00a0weeks following intake, were made in 42 individuals who inhaled vapor from dried toad secretion at several European locations. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, ratings of satisfaction with life and convergent thinking significantly increased right after intake and were maintained at follow-up 4\u00a0weeks later. Ratings of mindfulness also increased over time and reached statistical significance at 4\u00a0weeks. Ratings of depression, anxiety, and stress decreased after the session, and reached significance at 4\u00a0weeks. Participants that experienced high levels of ego dissolution or oceanic boundlessness during the session displayed higher ratings of satisfaction with life and lower ratings of depression and stress. CONCLUSION: A single inhalation of vapor from dried toad secretion containing 5-MeO-DMT produces sub-acute and long-term changes in affect and cognition in volunteers. These results warrant exploratory research into therapeutic applications of 5-MeO-DMT."}

Psychedelic effects are believed to emerge through stimulation of serotonin 2A receptors (5-HT2ARs) by psilocybin's active metabolite, psilocin. We here report for the first time the relationship between intensity of psychedelic effects, cerebral 5-HT2AR occupancy and plasma levels of psilocin in humans. Eight healthy volunteers underwent positron emission tomography (PET) scans with the 5-HT2AR agonist radioligand [(11)C]Cimbi-36: one at baseline and one or two additional scans on the same day after a single oral intake of psilocybin (3-30\u2009mg). 5-HT2AR occupancy was calculated as the percent change in cerebral 5-HT2AR binding relative to baseline. Subjective psychedelic intensity and plasma psilocin levels were measured during the scans. Relations between subjective intensity, 5-HT2AR occupancy, and plasma psilocin levels were modeled using non-linear regression. Psilocybin intake resulted in dose-related 5-HT2AR occupancies up to 72%; plasma psilocin levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy conformed to a single-site binding model. Subjective intensity was correlated with both 5-HT2AR occupancy and psilocin levels as well as questionnaire scores. We report for the first time that intake of psilocybin leads to significant 5-HT2AR occupancy in the human brain, and that both psilocin plasma levels and 5-HT2AR occupancy are closely associated with subjective intensity ratings, strongly supporting that stimulation of 5-HT2AR is a key determinant for the psychedelic experience. Important for clinical studies, psilocin time-concentration curves varied but psilocin levels were closely associated with psychedelic experience."}

It is unknown whether this mechanism is also responsible for the psychological effects of MDMA in humans. We investigated the effect of citalopram pretreatment (40 mg iv) on the psychological effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg po) in a double-blind placebo-controlled psychometric study in 16 healthy human volunteers. MDMA produced an emotional state with heightened mood, increased self-confidence and extroversion, moderate derealization, and an intensification of sensory perception. Most of these effects were markedly reduced by citalopram. This finding suggests that the psychological effects of MDMA are mediated via action at the 5-HT uptake site to increase 5-HT release through the carrier, as expected from animal studies."}

Methods: 68 dance clubbers (mean age 21.6\u00a0years, 30 females and 38 males), were assessed at a Saturday night dance club, then 2\u20133 d later. Three subgroups were compared: 32 current Ecstasy users who had taken Ecstasy/MDMA that evening, 10 abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users on other psychoactive drugs, and 26 non-user controls (predominantly alcohol drinkers). In a comparatively quiet area of the dance club, each unpaid volunteer had their ear temperature recorded, and completed a questionnaire on thermal feelings and mood states. A similar questionnaire was repeated 2\u20133 d later by mobile telephone. Results: Ecstasy/MDMA users had a mean body temperature 1.2\u00b0C higher than non-user controls (P < 0.001), and felt significantly hotter and thirstier. The abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA polydrug user group had a mean body temperature intermediate between the other 2 groups, significantly higher than controls, and significantly lower than current Ecstasy/MDMA users. After 2\u20133 d of recovery, the Ecstasy/MDMA users remained significantly \u2018thirstier\u2019. Higher body temperature while clubbing was associated with greater Ecstasy/MDMA usage at the club, and younger age of first use. Higher temperature also correlated with lower elation and poor memory 2\u20133 d later. It also correlated positively with nicotine, and negatively with cannabis. Conclusions: Ecstasy/MDMA using dance clubbers had significantly higher body temperature than non-user controls.

Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) at baseline and after treatment. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go-no-go tasks at baseline. RESULTS: A generalized linear model with adjustments for demographic characteristics, treatment groups, and total HDRS scores at baseline revealed only a significant effect of working memory function (correct responses and omissions) on the changes in depressive symptoms measured by HDRS at baseline (F=12.862, p<0.05). Correlation analysis further showed a negative relationship (r=0.519, p=0.027) between pretreatment working memory function and changes in HDRS scores in the 0.5\u2009mg/kg ketamine group.

BACKGROUND: Ecstasy, containing 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, has shown evidence of causing cognitive deficits and parkinsonian signs. Previous research has examined cognitive performance after a period of prolonged abstinence, but research assessing the early effects of ecstasy after recent use is limited despite temporal neurochemical differences demonstrated in nonhuman models. METHODS: This study compared task performance between 13 ecstasy users (10 to 15 h postdrug use) and a control group on a battery of neuropsychologic assessments while matching for education level, sleep deprivation, and premorbid IQ. The groups were also compared on measures relating to parkinsonian signs. RESULTS: The ecstasy subjects showed impairments on measures of executive function as evaluated by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). Short-delay free recall memory was also impaired in ecstasy subjects on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). No extrapyramidal motor impairments were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits resemble deficits previously reported in chronic ecstasy use but also seem to reveal transient impairments in executive function. Future research is needed to better understand the neurologic and neuropsychologic implications of ecstasy use across time and extent of use."}

METHODS: Dimethyltryptamine, an endogenous mammalian hallucinogen and drug of abuse, was administered intravenously at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg to 11 experienced hallucinogen users, in a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized design. Treatments were separated by at least 1 week. RESULTS: Peak DMT blood levels and subjective effects were seen within 2 minutes after drug administration, and were negligible at 30 minutes. Dimethyltryptamine dose dependently elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of beta-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin. Growth hormone blood levels rose equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected. Threshold doses for significant effects relative to placebo were also hallucinogenic (0.2 mg/kg and higher). Subjects with five or more exposures to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine demonstrated less robust pupil diameter effects than those with two or fewer exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Dimethyltryptamine can be administered safely to experienced hallucinogen users and dose-response data generated for several measures hypothesized under serotonergic modulatory control. Additional studies characterizing the specific mechanisms mediating DMT's biological effects may prove useful in psychopharmacological investigations of drug-induced and endogenous alterations in brain function."}

It has long been hypothesized that dysregulation of subcortical dopamine systems in schizophrenia might result from a failure of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to adequately control subcortical dopaminergic function. The activity of midbrain dopaminergic neurons is regulated, in part, by glutamatergic projections from the PFC acting via glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that a pharmacologically induced disruption of NMDA transmission leads to an increase in amphetamine-induced dopamine release in humans. METHODS: In eight healthy volunteers, we compared striatal amphetamine-induced (0.25 mg/kg) dopamine release under control conditions and under sustained disruption of NMDA transmission induced by infusion of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by 0.4 mg/kg/hour intravenous infusion for 4 hours). Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was determined with single photon emission computed tomography, as the reduction in the binding potential (BP) of the radiolabeled D(2) receptor antagonist [(123)I]IBZM. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly enhanced the amphetamine-induced decrease in [(123)I]IBZM BP, from -5.5% +/- 3.5% under control conditions to -12. 8% +/- 8.8% under ketamine pretreatment (repeated-measures analysis of variance, p =.023). CONCLUSIONS: The increase in amphetamine-induced dopamine release induced by ketamine (greater than twofold) was comparable in magnitude to the exaggerated response seen in patients with schizophrenia. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that the alteration of dopamine release revealed by amphetamine challenge in schizophrenia results from a disruption of glutamatergic neuronal systems regulating dopaminergic cell activity."}

CONTROL GROUP: Local anaesthesia (LA), articaine 4% plus epinephrine 1:200,000 (n = 35); test group P/M: LA, additional pentazocine 0.40 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35); test group K25/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.25 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35), test group K50/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.5 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35). LA was injected 3 min after application of the systemic medication in the test groups or application of a placebo (saline 0.9%) in the control group. Three further minutes later, operation was started. For evaluation questionnaires, visual analogue scales (VAS) and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were used. For testing retrograde and anterograde amnesia, acoustic sensations were delivered before application of the systemic medication (a Christmas carol) and during operation (the German national anthem). RESULTS. The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data, duration of operation, applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation. The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild, in contrast to the control group. Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups. Retrograde amnesia was not found in any group. Complete anterograde amnesia was observed in all test groups with respect to the intraoperative sensation, but even in the control group 50% of the patients did not remember having heard the national anthem. As subjective feelings negative criteria were mainly reported in the control group, where as in all test groups positive sensations dominated. Dreams were reported mostly after the higher dosage of ketamine, but no patient experienced any unpleasant dreams. The clinical assessment of the different regimes were excellent for test groups P/M and K50/M, modest for the control group and test group K25/M. Postoperatively, patients of test group P/M were remarkably sedated, but no clinically relevant sedation or motor weakness were observed in the other groups. Postoperative pain sensations were rated more intense in all test groups than in the control group. In test groups P/M and K25/M an increasing pain level was recorded during the postoperative period, with the consequence of a higher demand rate for analgesics. CONCLUSIONS. Dental surgery can be performed safely with low-dose ketamine/midazolam. Compared to pentazocine/midazolam, the higher dosage of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg bw) showed identical results intraoperatively, but was superior during the postoperative period (vigilance), and thus may represent a suitable dosage. The lower dosage of ketamine resulted in worse operating conditions, but a dosage higher than 0.5 mg/kg bw might lead to unconscious sedation and might increase the frequency of unpleasant dreams."}

{"record_id": 6074, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Morphine']", "title": "Geriatric Ketamine for Pain Management Study", "text": "Elderly patients are making up a greater proportion of the New York State population every year as the nation's overall population continues to age at a rapid pace. Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non\u2010opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well\u2010being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an \"opioid\u2010free\" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double\u2010blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub\u2010dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 \u2010 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non\u2010traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on\u2010duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e\u2010mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition on all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research manager and statistician, who will be independent of any data collection."}

We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N\u2010methyl\u2010d\u2010aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment resistant depression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients who presented with clinically significant SI across a trans\u2010diagnostic sample (n=24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. Suicidal ideation measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 hours post\u2010treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary analyses included the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale\u2010Suicidal Ideation (MADRS\u2010SI) score at 24 hours and additional measures beyond the 24\u2010hour time point. Results: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7\u2010day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 hours (p=0.32), however a significant difference emerged at 48 hours (p=0.047). MADRS\u2010SI score was lower in the ketamine compared to midazolam group at 24 hours (p=0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7\u2010day assessment period. Conclusions: The current findings provide support for the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ketamine as an intervention for suicidal ideation in patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior across mood and anxiety disorders."}

We also examined whether schizophrenics experienced quantitative or qualitative differences in ketamine response in comparison to normal controls. Schizophrenics experienced a brief-ketamine-induced exacerbation of positive and negative symptoms with further decrements in recall and recognition memory. They also displayed greater ketamine-induced impairments in free recall than normals. Qualitative differences included auditory hallucinations and paranoia in patients but not in normals.

This study aimed to assess whether PF\u201004958242 would attenuate ketamine\u2010induced impairment in verbal learning, working memory, SWM and psychotomimetic effects in healthy humans. Methods: 29 healthy men participated in this randomized, 2 period, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover study. During each period subjects received placebo or active PF\u201004958242 (0.35 mg on day 1 followed by 0.25 mg/day on day 2\u20105). They then underwent a ketamine challenge (racemic ketamine 0.23 mg/kg bolus over one min; and 0.58 mg/kg/hour for \u223c 70 min) followed by assessment of cognitive (Hopkins Verbal Learning Test\u2010Revised (HVLT\u2010R), N\u2010back and SWM tasks from Cogstate) and psychotomimetic effects (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale (CADSS)). The primary efficacy endpoint, mean score of immediate recall trials 2 and 3 in HVLT R on Day 5 (HVLT\u2010R\u2010IR2\u20103), was analyzed in completers (n=22) with a linear crossover model including period, sequence, and treatment as fixed factors, baseline score as a continuous covariate, and subject as a random effect. Results: Ketamine resulted in a mean impairment of 2.96 words on the HVLTR\u2010IR2\u20103 and induced transient psychotomimetic effects.

Despite the availability of various treatments for depression, including pharmacotherapy, there is still a need to search for new agents with higher effectiveness and faster onset of action, especially for patients with treatment-resistant depression. AREAS COVERED: A substance that has attracted considerable attention for nearly a decade is psilocybin, a natural psychedelic found in psilocybin mushrooms. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, based on pivotal randomized clinical trials. Moreover, we used findings from observational studies regarding recreational use. We also looked at ongoing clinical trials and discussed the registration status and clinical potential of the drug. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical phase I-II trials published to date reported promising results for psilocybin in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression, in a relatively short time after administration. However, before psilocybin is approved for use and administered to patients with depression, the results of large ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety and to change the way it is perceived by physicians and patients."}

Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post\u2010intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1\u2010week post\u2010intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post\u2010infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti\u2010depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care. These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population, warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent."}

The relationship between ecstasy use and emotion recognition remains largely unknown. This study reports the findings on the neuropsychological effects of ecstasy use on recognition of basic human emotions among 100 abstinent ecstasy users, along with 100 demographically matched nonusers. Recognition of both facial and prosodic emotions was studied. In addition, neuropsychological predictors of emotion recognition for abstinent ecstasy users were examined. The results showed that abstinent ecstasy users were impaired, relative to nonusers, on overall emotion recognition. In particular, recognition of sadness and disgust was significantly affected. The emotion-recognition deficits observed among the abstinent ecstasy users may reflect a complex derangement of monoamines and/or general degenerative change observed in the addicted populations. The length of time in months since ecstasy was last consumed, cumulative ecstasy dosage, and years of education negatively predicted various domains of emotion recognition. The observation that nonverbal and verbal fluency functions were significant predictors of emotion identification, as well as of recognition of sadness and disgust, suggests that the frontal executive system might be affected by ecstasy use. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

METHODS: Forty alcohol dependent adults were randomized to either a 52-minute infusion of ketamine or midazolam, which they received on a designated quit-day during the second week of a five-week motivational enhancement therapy regimen. Psychoactive effects were assessed following the infusion, and alcohol use was monitored for the subsequent 3\u2009weeks at each twice-weekly visit. RESULTS: We found that ketamine leads to significantly greater mystical-type effects (by Hood Mysticism Scale) and dissociation (by Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale) compared to the active control. Ketamine also led to significant reduction in at-risk drinking. The Hood Mysticism Scale, but not Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale score, was found to mediate the effect of ketamine on drinking behavior. CONCLUSIONS: This trial adds evidence to the literature on the importance of mystical-type experiences in addiction treatment. Future research should continue to investigate the relationship between the psychoactive effects of psychedelic therapeutics and clinical outcomes for other substance use and mental health disorders."}

METHODS: Fifty-two healthy participants comprised abstinent recreational users of stimulant drugs, 27 female and 25 male, mean age 24.8 years. Three test sessions involved acute 100 mg oral 3.4-methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 0.42 mg/kg oral methamphetamine, and matching placebo. Drug administration was counterbalanced, testing was double-blind, and medical supervision was present throughout. Car-driving performance on a laboratory simulator was assessed after 3 and 24 h, with the findings being presented elsewhere. Positive and negative moods (PANAS self-ratings) were completed before drug administration, 3, 4.5, and 24 h later. Blood samples were taken to monitor drug plasma levels. RESULTS: Following MDMA, there were no significant increases in positive moods, whereas negative moods were significantly higher than under placebo. Methamphetamine led to significant increases in both positive and negative moods. The MDMA findings contrast with the elated moods, typically noted by dance clubbers on Ecstasy. However, they are consistent with some previous laboratory findings, since a wide array of positive and negative mood changes have been demonstrated. One possible explanatory factor was the neutral environmental situation, particularly if a primary action of MDMA is to intensify ongoing psychological states. Other explanatory factors, such as dosage, gender, post-drug timing, neurohormonal aspects, and social factors, are also discussed. CONCLUSIONS: In the laboratory, acute methamphetamine led to significantly higher positive moods. However, against expectations, MDMA did not generate a significant increase in positive moods."}

Furthermore, recent research has suggested that psilocybin can produce experiences subjectively rated as uniquely meaningful and significant (Griffiths et al. 2006). It is therefore possible that psilocybin may facilitate or change the nature of peak experiences in users compared to non-users. This study was designed to compare the peak experiences of psilocybin users and non-users, to evaluate the frequency of peak experiences while under the influence of psilocybin, and to assess the perceived degree of alteration of consciousness during these experiences. Participants were recruited through convenience and snowball sampling from undergraduate classes and at a musical event. Participants were divided into three groups, those who reported a peak experience while under the influence of psilocybin (psilocybin peak experience: PPE), participants who had used psilocybin but reported their peak experiences did not occur while they were under the influence of psilocybin (non-psilocybin peak experience: NPPE), and participants who had never used psilocybin (non-user: NU). A total of 101 participants were asked to think about their peak experiences and complete a measure evaluating the degree of alteration of consciousness during that experience. Results indicated that 47% of psilocybin users reported their peak experience occurred while using psilocybin. In addition, there were significant differences among the three groups on all dimensions of alteration of consciousness. Future research is necessary to identify factors that influence the peak experiences of psilocybin users in naturalistic settings and contribute to the different characteristics of peak experiences of psilocybin users and non-users.

Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition.

This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002\u20132018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002\u22122005 to .72 % 2015\u22122018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12).

Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions."}

Since the cerebrovasculature is regulated partly by the serotonergic system, MDMA may affect cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. We evaluated 21 abstinent recreational MDMA users and 21 age- and gender-matched healthy subjects with brain SPECT and MRI. Ten of the MDMA subjects also had repeat SPECT and MRI after receiving two doses of MDMA. Abstinent MDMA users showed no significantly different global or regional CBF (rCBF) compared to the control subjects. However, within 3 weeks after MDMA administration, rCBF remained decreased in the visual cortex, the caudate, the superior parietal and dorsolateral frontal regions compared to baseline rCBF. The decreased rCBF tended to be more pronounced in subjects who received the higher dosage of MDMA. Two subjects who were scanned at 2-3 months after MDMA administration showed increased rather than decreased rCBF. Low-dose recreational MDMA use does not cause detectable persistent rCBF changes in humans. The lack of long-term rCBF changes may be due to a non-significant effect of serotonergic deficits on rCBF, or regeneration of serotonergic nerve terminals. The subacute decrease in rCBF after MDMA administration may be due to the direct effect of MDMA on the serotonergic system or the indirect effects of its metabolites on the dopaminergic system; the preliminary data suggest these effects may be transient.

(2) in individuals with MDD, did KOR or dynorphin baseline plasma levels moderate ketamine's therapeutic effects or adverse effects? and (3) in individuals with MDD, were KOR or dynorphin plasma levels affected after treatment with ketamine compared with placebo? METHODS: Thirty-nine unmedicated individuals with MDD (23 women) and 25 HVs (16 women) received intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and placebo in a randomized, crossover, double-blind trial. Blood was obtained from all participants at baseline and at 3 postinfusion time points (230 minutes, day 1, day 3). Linear mixed model regressions were used. RESULTS: At baseline, participants with MDD had lower KOR plasma levels than HVs ( F1,60 = 13.16, P < 0.001), and women (MDD and HVs) had higher KOR plasma levels than men ( F1,60 = 4.98, P = 0.03). Diagnosis and sex had no significant effects on baseline dynorphin levels. Baseline KOR and dynorphin levels did not moderate ketamine's therapeutic or adverse effects. Compared with placebo, ketamine was not associated with postinfusion changes in KOR or dynorphin levels. CONCLUSIONS: In humans, diagnosis of MDD and biological sex are involved with changes in components of the KOR/dynorphin pathway. Neither KOR nor dynorphin levels consistently moderated ketamine's therapeutic effects or adverse effects, nor were levels altered after ketamine infusion.

A series of clinical studies demonstrated that QEEG prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and precedes clinical improvement.1. Ketamine, a non\u2010competitive antagonist of NMDA receptors, has a unique rapid antidepressant effect2 but its influence on theta cordance is still unknown. To date predictive value of cordance3 in response to single infusion of ketamine in depressive subjects has not been studied. We hypothesized in our study that the changes in prefrontal cordance 24 hours after the infusion will predict sustained antidepressant response fourth day after the infusion. Methods. In a double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled experiment we studied the influence of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) on theta cordance in a group of 27 right\u2010handed hospitalized depressive patients on stable antidepressant medication. Antidepressant response was defined as 50% decrease of depressive symptoms evaluated fourth and seventh day after infusion by means of Montgomery\u2010A\u02dasberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). Psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale before and after the infusion.4 Three EEG segments obtained before, after the infusion and 24 hours after the dosing were entered into spectral analyses. QEEG cordance values in theta frequency band were calculated according to UCLA algorithm3 from 3 prefrontal electrodes (Fz, Fp1, Fp2). Results. Responders (n = 11) to ketamine in comparison to nonresponders (n = 16), showed significant difference in cordance values at the end of ketamine infusion (Spearman, P = .039). The cordance decrease, measured between the end of infusion and next day, positively correlated with ketamine antidepressant response (MADRS decrease) fourth day after infusion (2\u2010tailed Fisher's exact test, df = 1, P = .0076) with NPV 90.9% (95% CI 64.3% to 99.5%) and PPV 62.5% (95% CI 44.2% to 68.4%).

Our data indicate that ketamine (glutamatergic\u2010based drug) infusion immediately induces similar changes as monoaminergic\u2010based antidepressants do gradually after a series of downstream signalling steps. The reduction in theta prefrontal cordance could serve as a marker of ketamine's sustained antidepressant response, a hypothesis that should be tested in larger depressive population."}

There is no perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent for participation, the day before infusion (Day \u20101), participants will complete a set of rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID; 30\u03bcg/kg over 40 minutes). We will randomize infusion sequences in a 1\u2010to\u20101 ratio: KET followed by MID (K\u2192M) or vice versa (M\u2192K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and Day 21, separated by a 20\u2010day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. We will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery\u2010\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Days \u20101, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41.

Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following the second infusion. Study Groups: Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30\u03bcg/kg of MID diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter reduces the response to ketamine."}

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with unipolar depression were randomized (1:1) to thrice-weekly racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions or ECT in a parallel, open-label, non-inferiority study. The primary outcome was remission (Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score \u226410). Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), time to remission, and relapse. Treatment sessions (maximum of 12) were administered until remission or maximal effect was achieved. Remitters were followed for 12 months after the final treatment session. RESULTS: In total 186 inpatients were included and received treatment. Among patients receiving ECT, 63% remitted compared with 46% receiving ketamine infusions (P\u2009=\u2009.026; difference 95% CI 2%, 30%). Both ketamine and ECT required a median of 6 treatment sessions to induce remission. Distinct AEs were associated with each treatment. Serious and long-lasting AEs, including cases of persisting amnesia, were more common with ECT, while treatment-emergent AEs led to more dropouts in the ketamine group. Among remitters, 70% and 63%, with 57 and 61 median days in remission, relapsed within 12 months in the ketamine and ECT groups, respectively (P\u2009=\u2009.52). CONCLUSION: Remission and cumulative symptom reduction following multiple racemic ketamine infusions in severely ill patients (age 18-85 years) in an authentic clinical setting suggest that ketamine, despite being inferior to ECT, can be a safe and valuable tool in treating unipolar depression."}

METHODS: Thirty patients with TRD were enrolled and underwent eight ECT sessions with ketamine anaesthesia (0.8 mg/kg) alone. Depression severity, response and remission were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to examine serum BDNF levels in patients with TRD at baseline and after the second, fourth and eighth ECT sessions. Baseline serum samples were also collected for 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in serum BDNF levels between patients with TRD and healthy controls at baseline (p > 0.05). The remission rate was 76.7% (23/30) after the last ECT treatment, although all patients with TRD obtained antidepressant response criteria. Serum BDNF levels were not altered compared to baseline, even between remitters and nonremitters (all p > 0.05), despite the significant reduction in HAMD-17 and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores after ECT with ketamine anaesthesia (all p < 0.05). The antidepressant effects of ECT with ketamine anaesthesia were not correlated with changes in serum BDNF levels (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicated that serum BDNF levels do not appear to be a reliable biomarker to determine the antidepressant effects of ketamine as an anaesthesia in ECT for patients with TRD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings."}

However, recent evidence, suggests that most of the currently known NMDA antagonists have a broader receptor profile than originally thought. Besides exerting an antagonistic effect on NMDA receptors, they have agonistic effects on dopamine D2 receptors. Can haloperidol (D2 antagonist) counteract the disruptive effects of ketamine on psychophysiological parameters of human attention? In a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled experiment 18 healthy male volunteers received placebo/placebo, placebo/ketamine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) and haloperidol (2 mg)/ketamine (0.3 mg/kg i.v.) on three separate test days, after which they were tested in an auditory selective\u2010attention paradigm. Haloperidol/ketamine reduced task performance compared to placebo/placebo, while the task performance in these two treatments did not differ from placebo/ketamine. Furthermore, placebo/ketamine reduced processing negativity compared to both placebo/placebo and haloperidol/ketamine, while processing negativity did not differ between placebo/placebo and haloperidol/ketamine treatments. However, both placebo/ketamine and haloperidol/ketamine reduced P300 amplitude compared to placebo/placebo, while P300 amplitude did not differ between placebo/ketamine and haloperidol/ketamine treatments. The combined effects of haloperidol and ketamine reduced task performance, suggesting that this is dependent on dopaminergic D2 activity, probably in the prefrontal cortex. In addition, ketamine reduced both P300 amplitude and processing negativity. In contrast to the P300 amplitude, the disruptive effects of ketamine on processing negativity could be prevented by pretreatment with haloperidol. The current results suggest that ketamine reduced P300 amplitude by its antagonistic effect on glutamatergic activity, while it reduced processing negativity by its agonistic effect on dopaminergic D2 activity."}

We aimed to evaluate the differential impact of ketamine and esketamine on serum BDNF levels and its association with response patterns in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Participants (n = 53) are from a randomized, double-blind clinical trial comparing the efficacy of single-dose ketamine (0.5mg/kg, n = 27) and esketamine (0.25mg/kg, n = 26) in TRD.

Blood samples were collected before infusion, 24 hours, and 7 days afterwards. RESULTS: There were no significant changes in BDNF levels at post-infusion evaluation points, and no difference in BDNF levels comparing ketamine and esketamine. Both drugs exhibited similar therapeutic effect. There was no association between BDNF levels and response to treatment or severity of depressive symptoms. CONCLUSION: There was no significant treatment impact on BDNF serum levels - neither with ketamine nor esketamine - despite therapeutic response.

Recent studies have found mixed results concerning the effects of low doses of psychedelics (\"microdosing\") on these domains. However, microdosing is generally investigated using instruments designed to assess larger doses of psychedelics, which might lack sensitivity and specificity for this purpose. OBJECTIVES: Determine whether unconstrained speech contains signatures capable of identifying the acute effects of psilocybin microdoses. METHODS: Natural speech under psilocybin microdoses (0.5\u00a0g of psilocybin mushrooms) was acquired from thirty-four healthy adult volunteers (11 females: 32.09\u2009\u00b1\u20093.53\u00a0years; 23 males: 30.87\u2009\u00b1\u20094.64\u00a0years) following a double-blind and placebo-controlled experimental design with two measurement weeks per participant. On Wednesdays and Fridays of each week, participants consumed either the active dose (psilocybin) or the placebo (edible mushrooms). Features of interest were defined based on variables known to be affected by higher doses: verbosity, semantic variability, and sentiment scores. Machine learning models were used to discriminate between conditions. Classifiers were trained and tested using stratified cross-validation to compute the AUC and p-values. RESULTS: Except for semantic variability, these metrics presented significant differences between a typical active microdose and the inactive placebo condition. Machine learning classifiers were capable of distinguishing between conditions with high accuracy (AUC [Formula: see text] 0.8). CONCLUSIONS: These results constitute first evidence that low doses of serotonergic psychedelics can be identified from unconstrained natural speech, with potential for widely applicable, affordable, and ecologically valid monitoring of microdosing schedules."}

Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non\u2010responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score \u226522 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open\u2010label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4\u20106 hours post\u2010infusion, subjects were randomized double\u2010blind to either flexible\u2010dose (100\u2010200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non\u2010responders were defined as \u226550% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre\u2010randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within\u2010subjects factor and drug as a between\u2010subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post\u2010infusion, 32 patients were non\u2010responders, and 16 non\u2010responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small\u2010to\u2010medium effect. In non\u2010responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition \u2010 placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop\u2010outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop\u2010outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop\u2010outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop\u2010outs were counted as non\u2010responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small\u2010to\u2010moderate\u2010sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders. There are several potential limitations, however, that may preclude broader generalization to other populations: our highly\u2010refractory cohort and insufficient trial duration."}

Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with DSM-5 SAD and compared the effects between intravenous ketamine (0.5\u2009mg/kg over 40\u2009min) and placebo (normal saline) on social phobia symptoms. Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28-day washout period between infusions. Ratings of anxiety were assessed 3-h post-infusion and followed for 14 days. We used linear mixed models to assess the impact of ketamine and placebo on anxiety symptoms. Outcomes were blinded ratings on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and self-reported anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS-Anxiety). We also used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the proportion of treatment responders. Based on prior studies, we defined response as a greater than 35% LSAS reduction and 50% VAS-Anxiety reduction. We found ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety relative to placebo on the LSAS (Time \u00d7 Treatment: F(9,115)=2.6, p=0.01) but not the VAS-Anxiety (Time \u00d7 Treatment: F(10,141)=0.4, p=0.95). Participants were significantly more likely to exhibit a treatment response after ketamine infusion relative to placebo in the first 2 weeks following infusion measured on the LSAS (33.33% response ketamine vs 0% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.24, p=0.025) and VAS (88.89% response ketamine vs 52.94% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.12, p=0.034). In conclusion, this proof-of-concept trial provides initial evidence that ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety."}

Recent literature has shown that the anesthetic agent ketamine has some antidepressant properties at low doses and may be an alternative therapy for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder. We hypothesized that the use of low-dose ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct in ECT would more rapidly improve depression while maintaining hemodynamic stability than ECT with propofol alone. METHODS: Institutional ethics approval was obtained, and the use of ketamine in this study was approved by Health Canada. This is a randomized, double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial that involved ketamine administration at 0.5 mg/kg IV in addition to propofol anesthesia for ECT. The primary outcome was the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50% reduction in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Secondary outcomes included the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 25% reduction in MADRS score, as well as any differences in the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity, hemodynamic variables, and seizure duration. Adverse events were recorded for safety assessment. RESULTS: A total of 45 patients completed the study. No difference was found between groups with respect to the primary or secondary outcomes. The ketamine group showed a trend towards a decreased dose of propofol required to achieve adequate anesthesia. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine does not improve psychiatric outcomes in the setting of propofol-based anesthesia for ECT. Specifically, ketamine did not reduce the number of ECT sessions necessary to achieve a 50 or 25% reduction in MADRS scores. Reassuringly, the fact that no differences in hemodynamic variables or unexpected adverse events occurred suggests that low-dose ketamine may be safely used in this setting should clinical indications warrant its use.

This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital. METHODS: Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto, Canada received six infusions of 0.5\u202fmg/kg intravenous (IV) ketamine (n\u202f=\u202f5) over approximately 12 days, in addition to treatment-as-usual. Suicide and depression rating scores (Scale for Suicidal Ideation, SSI; Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, MADRS) were obtained at baseline, on treatment days, on days 14 and 42 (primary endpoint). RESULTS: All patients experienced benefit with ketamine. SSI scores diminished by 84% from 14.0\u202f\u00b1\u202f4.5 at baseline to 2.2\u202f\u00b1\u202f2.5 at study endpoint.

Two patients withdrew from the study, one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event (dissociative effects) during the ketamine infusion. LIMITATIONS: The major limitation of this study is the small sample size. DISCUSSION: These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two-fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions. They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible. These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in \"real-world\" settings."}

The present study aimed to assess whether evening doses of MDMA added to, or interacted with the memory impairment due to sleep deprivation. Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 75 and 50 mg divided over the evening or double placebo. Memory tests and subjective measures of mood were conducted at baseline and three times post dosing that is at 6.30 pm, 9.30 pm, 1.30 am and 7 am, respectively -1.5, 1.5, 5.5 and 11 h relative to drug intake (first dose). Memory performance detoriated progessively over time as a function of sleep loss, independent of treatment. MDMA added to this impairment as indicated by a significant main effect of MDMA on verbal and spatial memory performance. Mood ratings and response speed revealed an MDMA by Time interaction. After administration of MDMA response speed improved and feelings of vigor, friendliness, elation, anxiety, confusion, arousal and positive mood increased in magnitude during the night, while all these parameters returned to placebo-like levels on the final morning session. It is concluded that evening doses of MDMA selectively impair memory performance, and that this impairment is additional to the effect of sleep deprivation on memory performance."}

To date, psychedelic studies lack a uniform conceptualization of creativity and methodologically rigorous designs. AIMS: This study aimed at addressing previous issues by examining the effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on creativity using multimodal tasks and multidimensional approaches. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study, 24 healthy volunteers received 50\u2009\u03bcg of LSD or inactive placebo. Near drug peak, a creativity task battery was applied, including pattern meaning task (PMT), alternate uses task (AUT), picture concept task (PCT), creative metaphors task (MET) and figural creativity task (FIG). Creativity was assessed by scoring creativity criteria (novelty, utility, surprise), calculating divergent thinking (fluency, originality, flexibility, elaboration) and convergent thinking, computing semantic distances (semantic spread, semantic steps) and searching for data-driven special features. RESULTS: LSD, compared to placebo, changed several creativity measurements pointing to three overall LSD-induced phenomena: (1) 'pattern break', reflected by increased novelty, surprise, originality and semantic distances; (2) decreased 'organization', reflected by decreased utility, convergent thinking and, marginally, elaboration; and (3) 'meaning', reflected by increased symbolic thinking and ambiguity in the data-driven results. CONCLUSION: LSD changed creativity across modalities and measurement approaches. Three phenomena of pattern break, disorganization and meaning seemed to fundamentally influence creative cognition and behaviour pointing to a shift of cognitive resources 'away from normal' and 'towards the new'. LSD-induced symbolic thinking might provide a tool to support treatment efficiency in psychedelic-assisted therapy."}

The correct paragraph is given in erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2018-61088-001[/rid]). Rationale: Previous research demonstrating that lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) produces alterations in time perception has implications for its impact on conscious states and a range of psychological functions that necessitate precise interval timing. However, interpretation of this research is hindered by methodological limitations and an inability to dissociate direct neurochemical effects on interval timing from indirect effects attributable to altered states of consciousness. Methods: We conducted a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study contrasting oral administration of placebo with three microdoses of LSD (5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg) in older adults. Subjective drug effects were regularly recorded and interval timing was assessed using a temporal reproduction task spanning subsecond and suprasecond intervals. Results: LSD conditions were not associated with any robust changes in self-report indices of perception, mentation, or concentration. LSD reliably produced over-reproduction of temporal intervals of 2000 ms and longer with these effects most pronounced in the 10 \u03bcg dose condition. Hierarchical regression analyses indicated that LSD-mediated over-reproduction was independent of marginal differences in self-reported drug effects across conditions. Conclusions: These results suggest that microdose LSD produces temporal dilation of suprasecond intervals in the absence of subjective alterations of consciousness.

We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 \u00b1 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 \u00b1 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 \u00b1 0.29 and 9.0 \u00b1 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05).

This knowledge is mostly informed by animal models, while translational mechanistic studies in humans are scarce. For example, a study in a stress model indicated that stress reduced apical dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 neurons, while ketamine normalized spine numbers within one hour [2]. In addition, previous evidence indicated that ketamine's synaptic turnover changes are brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dependent [3]. In this study, we aimed to detail the impact of ketamine on CA1 and other hippocampal subfields and investigate the influence of BDNF genotype status in healthy human subjects. The study was conducted as post\u2010hoc analysis of a previously conducted trial. Methods: Thirty\u2010one healthy volunteers (14 female, mean age 25.2) underwent a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled crossover MRI study. Each subject was measured twice with a structural T1\u2010weighted structural MRI on a Siemens 3T Trio Scanner applying MPRAGE sequences (TR/TE=2300/4.21 ms, flip angle set to 9\u00b0, voxel size 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.1 mm). In the scanner after the baseline sequence, esketamine (0.11 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.12mg/kg was infused over 20 minutes. The second structural MRI scan was recorded within the same session 45 minutes afterwards. Each subject underwent a placebo scan in randomized crossover order at least a week apart. We used FreeSurfer 6.0 for automated hippocampal subfield delineation and genotyping for BDNF Val66Met genotype status (Val/Val n=19 vs. Met\u2010carrier n=12) was conducted with PLEX assay and the MassARRAY. We used linear mixed models (lMM) and differences of least means squares to compare volume differences before and after ketamine and placebo. Additionally, we incorporated BDNF genotype status as fixed effect. Post hoc testing was Tukey\u2010Kramer adjusted. Results: Linear mixed modeling yielded a significant main effect for drug (F1,741=7, p=0.0083). We found no significant subfield surviving Tukey\u2010Kramer correction (all p>0.05). For the left CA1 we found a trend for moderate volume increases after ketamine vs. placebo (p=0.076, t30=1.84, cohen's d=0.39). Within this sample, there was no main effect for genotype status on hippocampal subfield volume differences between ketamine and placebo (F1,742=0.18, p=0.67). Discussion: We conducted a forward translational psychiatric neuroscience study and demonstrated a significant effect of ketamine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volumes in humans. In accordance with previous results in animals, we found a trend for increased CA1 volumes within 45 min after ketamine infusion, that speak for immediate effects on neuronal plasticity of ketamine. The main limitation of this work is the low ketamine dose as well as lack of stress before the MRI experiment in healthy subjects. In addition, we did not substantiate an effect of BDNF genotype status on hippocampal volume changes. Notably, the genotype analysis had subgroup numbers, which demands follow\u2010up analyses in larger samples. No conflict of interest"}

This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub\u2010hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms. While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce, we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study. Methods: The study was conducted according to a doubleblind, randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, within\u2010subject design with four oral LSD doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg, LSD base) given on four separate test days, with minimally five days of washout in between. LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 \u03bcg LSD base in 1mL ethanol (96%) which resulted in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mL LSD, for 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg LSD. Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe. To mask the treatment condition, ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume. Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only (96%). Participants were 24 healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) aged 22.75 on average (SD = 2.97). All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs. Task\u2010based creativity was assessed three hours post\u2010treatment with the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and five hours post\u2010treatment with the Story Writing task. In the latter participants were asked to write a (non)\u2010fictive story around two given words. To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story, two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score. The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World\u2010Medical\u2010 Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within\u2010subject factor; additional within\u2010subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category.

RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial \u03b72 = 0.05) on rater\u2010scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial \u03b72 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial \u03b72 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial \u03b72 = 0.05) on the self\u2010rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post\u2010administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg, respectively. Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration, when the Story Writing Task was performed, were 69 (21), 137 (57), and 258 (112) pg/mL after the 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg dose, respectively. Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task\u2010based or self\u2010rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo\u2010controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations."}

Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects. However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are lacking. METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg LSD in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200\u00a0\u03bcg. RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200\u00a0\u03bcg LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 200\u00a0\u03bcg compared with 100\u00a0\u03bcg. Plasma levels of LSD were not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution at 100\u00a0\u03bcg. CONCLUSIONS: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater or different alterations of consciousness at 200\u00a0\u03bcg (i.e., a dose that is currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100\u00a0\u03bcg (i.e., a dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD, whereas more robustly induced effects of LSD may not result in such associations."}

Ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, produces rapid antidepressant effects. Here we correlated antidepressant response to ketamine with baseline neural response to emotional faces when judging emotion and gender. Methods: Ten unmedicated depressed MDD patients(3 males) participated in an FMRI study. Identical emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender. Subjects then participated in a placebo\u2010controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine(.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed repeatedly using the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Multiple regression estimated BOLD response when judging emotion (positive/ negative) and when judging gender (positive/negative). BOLD response (4 conditions) was correlated with treatment outcome(percent change in MADRS). Significance defined as voxel p<0.005; whole brain corrected. Results: BOLD response correlated positively with treatment response when judging negative emotion bilaterally in middle occipital cortex(MOC) and in left parahippocampal gyrus; and correlated positively when judging positive emotion in an overlapping region of left MOC. When judging gender and emotion was positive, a positive correlation was observed in a more dorsal, non\u2010overlapping region of left MOC. Conclusions: Neural activity in bilateral MOC when judging negative emotion correlated with subsequent treatment response to ketamine, regions previously found to predict treatment response to another rapid antidepressant (scopolamine). The patterns of neural response in visual cortex to specific emotion processing conditions in MDD may provide a biomarker of treatment response to multiple rapid antidepressant agents."}

Two of the most commonly used recreational drugs in the western world, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or \"ecstasy\") and ethanol (alcohol), are also often used in combination. The error-related negativity (ERN), correct-related negativity (CRN), and N2 are electrophysiological indices of performance monitoring. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to investigate how ethanol, MDMA, and their co-administration affect performance monitoring as indexed by the electrophysiological correlates. METHODS: Behavioral and EEG data were obtained from 14 healthy volunteers during execution of a speeded choice-reaction-time task after administration of ethanol, MDMA, and combined ethanol and MDMA, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design. RESULTS: Ethanol significantly reduced ERN amplitudes, while administration of MDMA did not affect the ERN. Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not further impair nor ameliorate the effect of ethanol alone. No drug effects on CRN nor N2 were observed. DISCUSSION: A decreased ERN following ethanol administration is in line with previous work and offers further support for the impairing effects of alcohol intoxication on performance monitoring. This impairment may underlie maladaptive behavior in people who are under influence. Moreover, these data demonstrate for the first time that MDMA does not affect performance monitoring nor does it interact with ethanol in this process. These findings corroborate the notion that MDMA leaves central executive functions relatively unaffected."}

In an attempt to tease out the relationship between these elements, this study tested the effects of the hallucinogenic mixed 5-HT1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin alone and after pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin. Eight healthy human volunteers were tested on a multiple-object tracking task and spatial working memory task under the four conditions: placebo, psilocybin (215 microg/kg), ketanserin (50 mg), and psilocybin and ketanserin. Psilocybin significantly reduced attentional tracking ability, but had no significant effect on spatial working memory, suggesting a functional dissociation between the two tasks. Pretreatment with ketanserin did not attenuate the effect of psilocybin on attentional performance, suggesting a primary involvement of the 5-HT1A receptor in the observed deficit. Based on physiological and pharmacological data, we speculate that this impaired attentional performance may reflect a reduced ability to suppress or ignore distracting stimuli rather than reduced attentional capacity. The clinical relevance of these results is also discussed."}

RESULTS: All three groups displayed significantly lower digit-backward span than digit-forward span with ecstasy users displaying the greatest difference. The parietally distributed P3b was significantly smaller in the digits backward task than in the digits forward task in non-ecstasy-using controls. Ecstasy users did not show the reduced P3b component in the backward task that was seen in both non-ecstasy-using control groups. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy users' performance was suppressed more by the concurrent processing demands of the working memory task than that of the non-ecstasy-using controls. Non-ecstasy-using controls showed differential event-related potential wave forms in the short-term and working memory tasks, and this pattern was not seen in the ecstasy users.

Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies."}

There is a paucity of research concerning the harm reduction practices employed by ecstasy users. This study aimed to explore the prevalence, nature and factors associated with harm reduction practices employed by ecstasy users in Australia, with a specific focus on the practice of preloading and postloading - the use of pharmaceuticals and natural products prior and subsequent to ecstasy use. One hundred and sixteen Australian residents aged 18 years and over who had used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime were recruited via convenience sampling, 'snowballing' and via web-based advertisements and completed an anonymous questionnaire. Participants reported using a wide range of strategies for minimising ecstasy-associated harm. The most common strategies used for reducing negative side effects, 'comedown' or neurotoxicity were drinking water, limiting or reducing ecstasy use, taking breaks and taking vitamins or other natural substances. Forty percent of the sample had tested their ecstasy pills for the presence of MDMA. Forty-one percent and 47% of participants had engaged in pre- and postloading, respectively, with the most common pre- and postloading substances being multivitamins, 5-HTP, magnesium and fruit or fruit juice. Younger mean age and 'high' total occasions of ecstasy use was significantly associated with preloading, and 'high' total use and frequency of use was associated with postloading. The results indicate that ecstasy users are aware of the potential for harm associated with ecstasy use and attempt to minimise harm by actively employing strategies. By exploring the pattern of harm reduction practices among ecstasy users, this study has highlighted the need for further research into the efficacy and potential clinical drug interactions associated with such practices, as well as the need for investigation of how such practices may affect patterns of ecstasy use. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30\u2009mg. In session 2, a 1.5\u2009mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30\u2009mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.7\u2009ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2\u2009\u00b1\u2009170.9\u2009mg\u2009\u00b7\u2009h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1% after 1.5\u2009mg/kg of MDMA (p\u2009=\u20090.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.028 to 0.998\u2009\u00b1\u20090.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p\u2009=\u20090.032 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6\u2009\u00b1\u200922.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6\u2009\u00b1\u200925.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6."}

METHODS: Thirty two adult participants (22-72 years; 17 female) with chronic suicidality completed 6 weeks of active treatment, receiving low (0.5\u00a0mg/kg - 3.0\u00a0mg/kg) doses of oral ketamine once per week, with a 4-week follow-up phase, to assess the effect of ketamine on their perceived stress. Stress was measured via self-report utilizing the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21(DASS-21), and analysed at pre-treatment (week 0), post-treatment (week 6) and at follow-up (week 10). RESULTS: Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant reduction in stress (p<.001) post-treatment and Reliable Change Index calculations confirmed this to be clinically significant. Furthermore, those classified as 'prolonged responders' demonstrated a sustained reduction in stress at follow-up (i.e. after 4 weeks of nil ketamine).

Esketamine exerts antidepressant effects. This study aims to assess whether an intraoperative sub-anesthetic dose of esketamine prevents postoperative depressive symptoms in these patients. METHODS: In this randomized, triple-blinded, placebo-controlled trial, we will enroll 130 perimenopausal women (aged 45-60 years) with breast cancer undergoing unilateral modified radical mastectomy. Patients will be randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to receive either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg i.v.) or normal saline after anesthesia induction and before skin incision. The primary outcome is the incidence of depressive symptoms at day 30 postoperatively, assessed using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcomes include incidence of depressive symptoms and BDI scores at day 1, 3, and 180 postoperatively, anxiety symptoms and scores at day 1, 3, 30, and 180 postoperatively, pain intensity and quality of recovery at day 1 and 2 postoperatively, nausea and vomiting within 48 hours postoperatively, length of postoperative hospital stay, and cancer-specific outcomes. Data will be analyzed in the modified intention-to-treat population. DISCUSSION: This is the first trial to evaluate the effects of a sub-anesthetic dose of esketamine on depressive symptoms in perimenopausal women after modified radical mastectomy. The results of this study will help to improve their mental health and recovery after breast cancer surgery. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry (ChiCTR2200064348)."}

METHODS: In this pilot dose-finding study, the efficacy and tolerability of ketamine given by rapid intravenous (i.v.) infusion were assessed in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, in four subjects with treatment- resistant depression. Each subject received up to four i.v. doses of ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4 mg/kg), given over 2-5 min, 1 week apart, and one randomly inserted placebo treatment. RESULTS: Three of four subjects achieved antidepressant response (\u2265 50% decrease in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores), two at the minimum 0.1 mg/kg dose, though all relapsed within a week. For two subjects, the greatest improvement occurred at the highest dose received. Rapid infusion over 2 min led to significant adverse psychotomimetic effects which also increased proportionately with ketamine dosage. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first trial to present dose-response data of ketamine efficacy and psychomimetic effects in depressed subjects. Antidepressant efficacy may be dose-related. Psychotomimetic effects were dose-related. Rapid infusion over 2 min may not be a feasible clinical approach to treatment, given poor tolerability."}

Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). METHODS: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio\u2010marker\u2010determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2\u20104.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid\u2010prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10\u201030 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre\u2010treatment, post\u2010treatment and at two\u2010year follow\u2010up. RESULTS: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 \u00b1 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t\u2010test (a=0.01, t=22.81, p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."}

Methods: We retrospectively collected the data from 10 hospitals in Taiwan on drug-related ED visits from May 2017 to December 2020. We then examined the gender differences in their socio-demographics, clinical manifestations, urine toxicological results, and other laboratory tests results using chi-square or multivariable logistic regression. Results: Among individuals with drug-related ED visits, there were 546 (73.7%) men and 195 (26.3%) women. The most commonly used drugs were meth/amphetamine, followed by synthetic cathinones, and ketamine and its analogs. Compared to men, women were younger (32.03 \u00b1 10.86 vs. 36.51 \u00b1 10.84 years, p < 0.001) and more likely to use new psychoactive substances (NPS) (p = 0.011). Men were more likely to have human immunodeficiency virus infection (p < 0.001), whereas women were more likely to report psychiatric comorbidities (p = 0.003). Women were less likely to have aggressive behaviors (odds ratio (OR): 0.59, 95% CI: 0.39\u20130.88). After adjusting for socio-demographics and drug types, women were still less likely to have aggressive behaviors than men (adjusted OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.38\u20130.93). The likelihood of rhabdomyolysis and intensive care unit admission was higher in men (p < 0.001).

Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications."}

Stress resilience is the ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience in at\u2010risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress\u2010induced psychiatric disorders.

Few functional consequences of MDMA- induced serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxicity have been identified, either in animals or humans. This study sought to determine whether individuals with a history of extensive MDMA use showed evidence of memory impairment, because brain serotonin has been implicated in mnemonic function. Method: The authors compared 24 abstinent MDMA users and 24 control subjects on several standardized tests of memory, after matching subjects for age, gender, educational level, and vocabulary score (a surrogate of verbal intelligence). The authors also explored correlations between changes in memory function and decrements in CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which serves as a marker of central 5-HT neural function. Results: Greater use of MDMA (total milligrams per month) was associated with greater impairment in immediate verbal memory (p<0.02) and delayed visual memory (p<0.06). Furthermore, lower vocabulary scores were associated with stronger dose-related effects, with men having greater dose-related deficits than women. Lastly, lower concentrations of CSF 5-HIAA were associated with poorer memory performance. Conclusion: Abstinent MDMA users have impairment in verbal and visual memory. The extent of memory impairment correlates with the degree of MDMA exposure and the reduction in brain 5-HT, as indexed by CSF 5-HIAA."}

A recently hypothesized antidepressant mechanism of action of ketamine is the inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent bursting activity of the habenula (Hb), a small brain structure that modulates reward and affective states. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 35 patients with MDD at baseline and 24 hours following treatment with i.v. ketamine. A seed-to-voxel functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed with the Hb as a seed-of-interest. Pre-post changes in FC and the associations between changes in FC of the Hb and depressive symptom severity were examined. RESULTS: A reduction in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline to 24 hours after ketamine infusion was associated with increased FC between the right Hb and a cluster in the right frontal pole (t\u2009=\u20094.65, P\u2009=\u2009.03, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected).

Given the small size of the Hb, it is possible that peri-habenular regions contributed to the results. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary results suggest that the Hb might be involved in ketamine's antidepressant action in patients with MDD, although these findings are limited by the lack of a control group."}

It has been suggested that chronic ketamine may also mimic aspects of this disorder, in particular impaired cognitive function. As semantic processing deficits are considered central to cognitive impairments in schizophrenia, this study aimed to characterize semantic impairments following both acute and chronic ketamine. METHODS: We examined the acute effects of two doses of ketamine (Experiment 1) using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, independent group design with 48 volunteers. Ketamine's chronic effects (Experiment 2) were explored in 16 ketamine users and 16 poly-drug controls. A semantic priming task with a frequency (high and low) and stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA: short-200 msec, long-750 msec) manipulation was used. RESULTS: In Experiment 1, acute ketamine produced inverse priming at the long SOA. In Experiment 2, ketamine users showed inverse priming for low-frequency words at the long SOA compared to poly-drug controls. CONCLUSIONS: The inverse priming effect at the long SOA induced by acute ketamine was indicative of controlled processing impairments. In ketamine users, there was also an indication of controlled processing impairments. Decreased priming for low-frequency words suggested that long-term ketamine abuse results in damage to the semantic store."}

The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual \u2018setting\u2019 variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

{"record_id": 6066, "keywords": "['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Ketamine', 'Midazolam']", "title": "Ketamine for Depression Relapse Prevention Following ECT", "text": "DESIGN: This pilot trial has two phases. Phase 1 is a prospective open study that involves recruiting a cohort of patients with major depressive disorder (DSM\u2010IV criteria) referred for ECT. Patients subsequently identified as being responders will be invited to participate in Phase 2, which is a two\u2010group parallel\u2010design randomised controlled pilot trial. Consented ECT\u2010responders will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a four\u2010week course of either once\u2010weekly ketamine or midazolam infusions, continuing regular care. Participants will be followed\u2010up over six\u2010months following ECT to identify if and when relapse occurs. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: In Phase 2, ECT responders will be randomised after baseline data collection. Patients and raters will be blind to treatment allocation. The anaesthetist administering ketamine/midazolam infusions will not be blinded but will not be involved in assessments or data analysis. Computerised random allocation, using randomly permuted blocks, will be done independently. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria: Patients \u226518 years with unipolar major depressive disorder (DSM\u2010IV), a 24\u2010item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD\u201024) score of \u226521, and referred for ECT will be invited to participate in the open Phase 1. Patients will have a physical examination, routine haematology and biochemistry investigations, and an ECG to screen for any medical conditions that might affect ability to be treated with ECT or ketamine. For the randomised Phase 2, patients must have (i) received a substantial course of ECT in Phase 1 (i.e. at least five sessions), (ii) achieved at least response criteria (i.e. \u226560% decrease from baseline HRSD\u201024 score and score \u226416 on two consecutive weekly ratings), (iii) have a nominated adult who can stay with them for 24\u2010hours on out\u2010patient treatment days, (iv) have a Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of \u226524, and (v) be able to provide informed consent. Patients will continue on regular psychotropic and other medications as prescribed by their consultant psychiatrist. This reflects the conditions under which adjunctive ketamine would be used in routine clinical practice, thereby enhancing the generalisability and external validity of a future definitive trial. Exclusion criteria are: any condition rendering patients medically unfit for general anaesthesia, ECT or ketamine; active suicidal intention; dementia; lifetime history of bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, or other Axis 1 diagnosis; ECT in the previous six\u2010months; alcohol/substance abuse in previous six\u2010months; pregnancy; inability/refusal to consent. Patients will be given verbal and full written information and be asked to provide written informed consent. INTERVENTIONS: Please see description OUTCOMES Process outcomes The focus of a pilot trial's outcomes is on trial process with assessment of the primary clinical outcome being secondary because the pilot itself is not designed to measure efficacy. Process outcomes that will inform a future definitive ketamine relapse prevention trial include information on the following: \u2010 recruitment methods and rate \u2010 willingness of participants to be randomised \u2010 willingness of participants to complete assessments \u2010 randomisation \u2010 success of blinding \u2010 ability to administer a course of ketamine infusions \u2010 medical safety and acceptability of ketamine infusions in an ECT responder population \u2010 rates of adverse dissociative and psychiatric events \u2010 adherence to allocated treatment \u2010 adherence to follow\u2010up \u2010 reasons for drop\u2010out from treatment \u2010 reasons for drop\u2010out from follow\u2010up \u2010 a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the ketamine and midazolam groups in six\u2010month relapse rates to help with power calculations for a future definitive trial Clinical outcomes: The following will be used to obtain baseline, intra\u2010treatment, end\u2010of\u2010treatment and follow\u2010up data. Most are standard measures used by ourselves and others in depression, ECT or keta ine studies. Raters will be trained on all measures before recruitment begins. (i) Diagnosis and treatment history: Diagnosis of major depressive disorder will be confirmed using the mood episodes module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u2010IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). The Columbia Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) will be used to obtain index episode treatment details and provide measures of treatment\u2010resistance. Handedness will be recorded with the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) will measure premorbid ability. Additional baseline data from patient interview and case\u2010note review will include age, sex, weight, height, occupation, educational attainment, duration of index depressive episode, number of previous depressive episodes, previous ECT, history of medical illness and surgical treatments, personal and family history of alcohol/substance dependency, presence of psychotic symptoms (detected by SCID), and current medications and other therapies. Changes in medications during Phases 1 and 2 will be documented at follow\u2010up interviews. (ii) Depression outcomes: The primary clinical outcome measure is the relapse rate at six months as measured using the objectively\u2010rated 24\u2010item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD\u201024). To enter Phase 1 patients must score \u226521. Response to ECT is defined as achieving \u226560% decrease from baseline HRSD\u201024 and score \u226416 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Remission criteria are \u226560% decrease in HRSD from baseline and score \u226410 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Criteria for relapse are \u226510 point increase in HRSD\u201024 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD \u226516; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow\u2010ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate self\u2010harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Timing of these events will be recorded. Patients must achieve at least response to participate in the Phase 2 pilot trial. Baseline and weekly intra\u2010treatment course HRSD\u201024 scores will be obtained during the treatment periods of Phases 1 and 2. During the infusion sessions in Phase 2 HRSD\u201024 scores will be obtained 60 minutes before the infusion begins and at +120 and +240 minutes afterwards. Baseline scores on sleep and appetite items will be maintained for repeated measures within one day. The +240 HRSD\u201024 scores will serve as the weekly post\u2010ECT scores up to follow\u2010up\u2010week 4. Depression measures will be repeated at weeks 6, 8, 12, 20 and 26 during the six\u2010month follow\u2010up. Subjective mood ratings will be measured at the above timepoints using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, self\u2010report version (QIDS\u2010SR16). 1. Global cognition will be assessed with the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE\u2010R; three parallel versions) which also generates Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency scores. The ACE\u2010R provides a total score (maximum=100) plus subscale scores for different aspects of cognition and has been used to study cognition in depression and by ourselves during ECT. 2. Forward and Backward Digit Spans \u2010 immediate short\u2010term memory, attention and working memory 3. Trail Making Test (Part A) \u2010 motor and psychomotor speed 4. Frontal\u2010executive function will be rated by Trail Making Test (Part B) plus letter and category verbal fluencies. 5. Anterograde verbal memory will be tested using the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test variant (immediate and delayed recall) of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. (iii) Cognitive outcomes: Cognitive testing can be challenging for severely depressed patients. It is vital that patients be encouraged to remain in the trial throughout the whole study period and a great deal of tact is required of raters. Priority will be given to obtaining scores on the HRSD\u201024. In a recent meta\u2010analysis we identified that ECT has the most pronounced subacute (i.e. 0\u20103 days post course) adverse effects upon verbal memor (delayed word list recall) and frontal executive function. Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine can cause problems with orientation, concentration, working and episodic memory but these resolve within two hours of beginning an infusion. There are no published data on effects of ketamine on cognition in ECT responders. We will use the following battery in Phase 1 (pre and post ECT course; the latter will serve as baseline for Phase 2) and Phase 2 (one day after the first and fourth infusions and at six\u2010months). Parallel versions will be used to reduce practice effects. 6. To measure retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information we will use the Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview (K\u2010AMI), The K\u2010AMI will be administered pre and post ECT, after the fourth ketamine infusion, and at six months. (iv) Ketamine psychotomimetic effects and adverse events: Acute psychotomimetic effects of ketamine are usually short\u2010lived and restricted to the infusion period, resolving within one hour. They include dissociative and psychiatric symptoms. In line with previous ketamine trials we will measure dissociative effects with the Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), psychotomimetic effects with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; four\u2010item positive symptom subscale), and mood elevation with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; mood item). These effects will be measured before, during (+35\u201040 mins) and after (+240 mins) the ketamine infusions. The Patient\u2010Rated Inventory of Side Effects will be used to document other general adverse events by patients at the same time points. All adverse medical, psychotomimetic and general events will be reported to the Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committees. STATISTICAL METHODS A formal sample size calculation is not appropriate for this pilot trial. Pilot trial data will be analysed on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis for all patients who completed at least one infusion. Data analyses will be performed blinded to allocation."}

Its increasing use over the last decade has led to concern regarding possible adverse effects on driving. The aims of the present study were to investigate the acute effects of MDMA on actual driving performance during the intoxication and withdrawal phase. METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA-users (nine males, nine females) aged 21-39 years participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way cross-over study. MDMA 75 mg, methylphenidate 20 mg and placebo were administered on day 1 of treatment (intoxication phase). Driving tests were conducted between 3 and 5 hours post-drug. Subjects returned the following day for a repetition of the driving tests between 27 and 29 hours post-drug (withdrawal phase). On-the-road driving tests consisted of a road-tracking test and a car-following test. Its main parameters were standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP), time to speed adaptation (TSA), brake reaction time (BRT) and gain. FINDINGS: MDMA and methylphenidate significantly decreased SDLP in the road-tracking tests by about 2 cm relative to placebo on day 1 (intoxication phase). In addition, MDMA intoxication decreased performance in the car-following test as indicated by a significant rise in the 'overshoot' of the subjects' response to speed decelerations of the leading vehicle. Driving performance was not affected by treatments during withdrawal on day 2. CONCLUSION: Collectively, these data indicate that MDMA is a stimulant drug that may improve certain aspects of the driving task, such as road-tracking performance, but may reduce performance in other aspects of the driving task, such as accuracy of speed adaptation during car-following performance."}

In humans long-term recreational use of ecstasy has been mainly associated with learning and memory impairments. The aim of the present study was to investigate the neuropsychological profile associated with ecstasy use within recreational polydrug users, and describe the cognitive changes related to maintained or variable ecstasy use along a two years period. We administered cognitive measures of attention, executive functions, memory and learning to three groups of participants: 37 current polydrug users with regular consumption of ecstasy and cannabis, 23 current cannabis users and 34 non-users free of illicit drugs. Four cognitive assessments were conducted during two years. At baseline, ecstasy polydrug users showed significantly poorer performance than cannabis users and non-drug using controls in a measure of semantic word fluency. When ecstasy users were classified according to lifetime use of ecstasy, the more severe users (more than 100 tablets) showed additional deficits on episodic memory. After two years ecstasy users showed persistent deficits on verbal fluency, working memory and processing speed. These findings should be interpreted with caution, since the possibility of premorbid group differences cannot be entirely excluded. Our findings support that ecstasy use, or ecstasy/cannabis synergic effects, are responsible for the sub-clinical deficits observed in ecstasy polydrug users, and provides additional evidence for long-term cognitive impairment owing to ecstasy consumption in the context of polydrug use. \u00a9 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology."}

Here we evaluate the potential for baseline amygdala response, during the processing of emotional faces, to predict subsequent treatment response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine. Methods: Sixteen unmedicated depressed MDD patients (7 males) participated in an fMRI study. Emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender, each with two difficulty levels, faces presented straight up or upside\u2010down. Subjects subsequently participated in a placebo\u2010controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine (.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). A 5mm radius sphere was placed in the left and right amygdala based on previously defined peak voxels showing differential hemodynamic responses to emotional faces before and after antidepressant treatment. BOLD signal estimates were averaged across voxels for each subject/ task condition, and correlated with percent change on MADRS (from baseline to 230 minutes post\u2010infusion). Significance was defined as p< 0.0125 (= 0.05/4 task conditions, judging gender/emotion, positive/negative emotion). Results: BOLD response in right amygdala correlated ( r>+0.6, p< 0.0125) with treatment response when judging positive and negative emotion presented straight up, and when judging positive emotion presented upside\u2010down. Conclusions: Neural activity in the right amygdala prior to treatment, during an overt emotional processing task, correlated with subsequent treatment response to ketamine. Thus, pre\u2010treatment amygdala activity measured in currently depressed MDD patients during emotion processing may provide a biomarker of subsequent treatment response."}

Perceptual organization deficits have been documented in schizophrenia and are thought to be related to some symptoms associated with the illness. The current study was designed to determine whether people who repeatedly self-administer ketamine would also show deficits in perceptual organization. Using a psychophysically well-controlled measure of contour integration, we compared a group of recreational users (n = 16) to a group of poly-drug using controls (n = 16). Contour integration performance was measured on the night of drug use and 3 days later when drug free. The results showed that on the night of drug use, ketamine produced a dysfunction in contour integration however, this was not present 3 days later when drug free. Levels of dissociation were also higher in ketamine users only on the night of drug use. These preliminary data provide some support for the role of NMDA-receptor hypofunctioning in dysfunctional coordination of cognitive activity."}

Clinical research has shown that blockade of the 5-HT(2) receptor nulls memory impairment during MDMA intoxication. Interestingly, studies have demonstrated that the eCB and the 5-HT system interact. It was hypothesized that MDMA would cause an increase in eCB concentrations together with a decrease in memory performance, and that combining MDMA with a 5-HT(2) receptor blocker ketanserin would lead to a counteraction of the MDMA effects on eCB concentrations and memory. METHODS: Twenty healthy recreational polydrug users entered a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject study. Participants received a pre-treatment (ketanserin 40\u00a0mg, placebo) followed 30\u00a0min later by a treatment (MDMA 75\u00a0mg, placebo). Verbal memory was tested by means of a 30-word learning test. Endocannabinoid concentrations (anandamide (2-AG); N-arachidonylethanolamine (AEA)) were assessed in blood at baseline, before (90\u00a0min post-treatment) and after cognitive tests (150\u00a0min post-treatment). RESULTS: Findings showed that MDMA impaired memory 90\u00a0min post-treatment in the word learning task. This effect was a replication of previous studies using the same dose of MDMA (75\u00a0mg) and the same learning paradigm. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA did not affect eCB concentrations, nor did ketanserin block MDMA-induced memory impairment. Ketanserin caused an increase in AEA concentrations, 180\u00a0min after administration. CONCLUSION: Current findings suggest that peripherally measured endocannabinoids are not associated with the verbal memory deficit during MDMA intoxication. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NTR3691."}

Participant data (n = 60) were pooled from three Phase 2 clinical studies employing triple-blind crossover designs. Participants were required to meet DSM-IV-R criteria for PTSD with a score higher than 50 on the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) as well as previous inadequate response to pharmacological and/or psychotherapeutic treatment. Data were aggregated into two groups: an active MDMA dose group (75-125 mg of MDMA; n = 45) or placebo/active control (0-40 mg of MDMA; n = 15). Measures included the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory (PTGI) and the CAPS-IV, which were administered at baseline, primary endpoint, treatment exit, and 12-month follow-up. At primary endpoint, the MDMA group demonstrated more PTG, Hedges' g = 1.14, 95% CI [0.49, 1.78], p < .001; and a larger reduction in PTSD symptom severity, Hedges' g = 0.88, 95% CI [-0.28, 1.50], p < .001, relative to the control group. Relative to baseline, at the 12-month follow-up, within-subject PTG was higher, p < .001; PTSD symptom severity scores were lower, p < .001; and two-thirds of participants (67.2%) no longer met criteria for PTSD. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD resulted in PTG and clinical symptom reductions of large-magnitude effect sizes. Results suggest that PTG may provide a new mechanism of action warranting further study."}

Sixteen recreational MDMA users received single doses of 25, 50, and 100 mg MDMA in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study. RESULTS: Results showed that sleep loss significantly impaired psychomotor function. MDMA generally did not affect performance but did improve rapid information processing at the highest dose in the morning after administration. In the evening, MDMA also increased subjective ratings of positive mood at every dose and subjective arousal at the highest dose. These subjective effects were no longer present after a night of sleep loss. DISCUSSION: It is concluded that sleep deprivation impairs psychomotor function and that stimulant effects of MDMA are not sufficient to compensate for this impairment."}

The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short-term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity (rMMN). The rMMN paradigm was run 3-4\u00a0h after a single 0.44\u00a0mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7\u00a0ng/mL) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges. Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS); 70% of patients demonstrated at least a 50% reduction their MADRS global score. Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials, directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine's acute attenuation of the MMN. This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post-deviant tone were used. Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone\u00a0between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex, which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24\u00a0h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depression. However, the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that, at least within the short term, ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration."}

More recently sub-anesthetic doses have shown benefit for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The majority of data on ketamine for depression is based on intravenous administration which is resource intensive and logistically challenging. Due to these concerns, novel modes of administration, including intranasal, are being explored. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved a commercially formulated intranasal s-enantiomer ketamine product, esketamine, for TRD. The cost of intranasal esketamine is significant and phase III clinical trials have not consistently demonstrated benefit over placebo. We describe a case of a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD) and acute suicidality who achieved rapid remission following three treatments with intranasal racemic ketamine. The associated drug cost was $42 USD, significantly cheaper than commercially available esketamine, and treatment was administered on an inpatient psychiatry ward with basic hemodynamic monitoring. Intranasal ketamine was not associated with significant adverse drug effects and facilitated a relatively short hospital admission.
