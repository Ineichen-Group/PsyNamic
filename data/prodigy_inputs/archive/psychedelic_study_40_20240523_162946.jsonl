Currently, patients with SI in the ED do not typically receive targeted interventions. Ketamine may have a role in treating SI within the ED because subanesthetic doses have rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. METHODS: This single-arm, open-label feasibility study enrolled 14 participants from the ED with acute SI who were awaiting voluntary admission to inpatient psychiatry to receive ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg, administered intravenously. Participants were assessed post administration to evaluate feasibility of administration in the ED and short-term effectiveness. Feasibility was determined by acceptability by patients and physicians as well as tolerability and ability to recruit participants into the study. Efficacy was assessed based on changes in (1) self-reported mood and (2) suicidal ideation pre- and postinfusion of ketamine. RESULTS: All patients reported severe depression and active SI at baseline. No serious adverse events were reported, and acceptability was rated highly by both participants and physicians (>70%). Two hours after receiving ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, the mean SI and somatic symptom burden were decreased compared to baseline (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively), and the mean self-reported mood was increased (P = 0.006). Improvements in mood and decreases in suicidality persisted at 6 hours.

We trained three different random forest classifiers, able to predict responses to ESK-NS with accuracies of 68.53% at T1 and 66.26% at T2 and remission at T2 with 68.60% of accuracy. Features like severe anhedonia, anxious distress, mixed symptoms as well as bipolarity were found to positively predict response and remission.

Evidence suggests that therapeutic alliance and subjective psychedelic experience during COMP360 psilocybin administration are potentially important elements of the treatment (1, 2). Understanding how these components relate to COMP360 psilocybin therapy response is important in order to optimize the treatment paradigm, clarify underlying mechanisms, and help identify patients most likely to benefit. A previous study in participants with major depressive disorder treated with either COMP360 or escitalopram with psychological support, found that depressive symptom severity reduction was significantly predicted by acute psychedelic effects, measured by the Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI) and Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) scores (1). Here we aim to compare these findings with data from our larger trial of COMP360 psilocybin therapy. Methods: This was a phase IIb, international, multicenter, randomized, fixed‐dose, parallel group, double‐blind trial investigating the safety and efficacy of a single dose of COMP360 psilocybin 25mg or 10mg compared to a 1mg dose in participants with TRD (COMP 001). COMP360 was administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists, delivered pre‐, during and post‐treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change from baseline in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score at Week 3. Subjective psychedelic experience was measured using the Five‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness rating scale (5D‐ASC), assessed at the end of the administration day, and EBI total scores, assessed the day following COMP360 psilocybin administration. Therapeutic alliance, measured by the Scale to Assess the Therapeutic Relationship Patient Version (STAR‐P), was hypothesized to predict depressive symptom severity at Week 3 (absolute MADRS total score), through its interaction with the psychedelic experience (5D‐ASC and EBI). Path analysis, a type of multiple regression evaluating relationships between variables to assess causality, was conducted on data from the 25mg dose group ‐ the optimal therapeutic dose. Saturated paths were modelled, with each path including three variables: STAR‐P total score, either a dimension score from the 5D‐ASC or EBI total score, and MADRS total score at Week 3 as the outcome. Due to expected multicollinearity between the psychedelic experience variables, separate paths were fitted for EBI total score and for each of the five dimensions of the 5D‐ASC. The path analyses used maximum likelihood estimation as the estimation method. Results: N = 233 participants (mean age 39.8 years; n = 121 female; 94% psilocybin‐naïve) were randomized to COMP360 25 mg (n = 79), 10 mg (n = 75), or 1 mg (n = 79). The week 3 MADRS total score was significantly predicted by: EBI total score (β [standardized effect]=‐0.57, R2[variance explained]=0.35, p < 0.0001), and the following 5D‐ASC dimensions: visual restructuralization (β = ‐0.54, R2 = 0.30, p < 0.0001), oceanic boundlessness (β = ‐0.53, R2 = 0.29, p < 0.0001), and auditory alterations (β = ‐0.24, R2 = 0.09, p = 0.027). These variables all had a positive effect on the MADRS total score at Week 3 corresponding to a reduction of the total score. The absolute standardized effects and variance explained were largest for EBI total score, indicating it as the most reliable predictor of MADRS total scores at Week 3. The indirect effect of STAR‐P on depression outcome was not significant for any path. Conclusions: Path analyses conducted on data from our phase IIb trial found that EBI total scores, and scores from three dimensions of the 5D‐ASC were significant predictors of depressive symptom severity at Week 3 following COMP360 psilocybin therapy. The i direct effect of therapeutic alliance was not significant for any of the psychedelic experience paths. The outcome of this path analysis, using data from a larger, more robust TRD sample than in Murphy et al. (1), confirms previous reports: that subjective psychedelic effects were significant predictors of depressive symptom severity; if, as is very likely, intensity of psychedelic experience reflects drug level, it also echoes the dose related response seen in primary analysis of the COMP 001 trial. In contrast, indirect effects of therapeutic alliance here were non‐significant. We cannot rule out the possibility that this may be due to differences in the therapy model, but effects in smaller studies are often not confirmed in larger samples. Further research is warranted to understand how we can use these findings to enhance the COMP360 psilocybin therapy treatment paradigm, and identify not only those who may be likely to benefit from this treatment, but also those who may not, and thus what can be improved to facilitate greater benefit.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-022-01484-1", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36456693/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

Both controls and ecstasy users showed normal, robust patterns of P3 anteriorization and delay in the NoGo compared to the Go condition. Ecstasy users had Lower P3 amplitudes at midline electrodes and a less anterior location of NoGo P3 peaks. These effects became weaker after statistically controlling for age, educational level and lifetime cannabis use. While lower P3 amplitudes are consistent with higher levels of neural disinhibition in ecstasy polydrug users, the normal switch pattern between response execution and inhibition, and the less anterior location of the NoGo P3, do not indicate disturbed inhibitory brain mechanisms. © 2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881105056535", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16166188/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Results will be presented from the first pivotal Phase 3 trial of the efficacy and safety of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted therapy for treatment of severe, chronic PTSD. Methods: The study was a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multi‐site Phase 3 trial of three 8‐hour MDMA sessions and 12 psychotherapy sessions. Randomization was stratified by sites in the U.S., Israel, and Canada. Change in PTSD (CAPS‐5) and functional impairment (SDS) were assessed by central blinded Independent Raters. Modified intent to treat efficacy analyses were conducted using a mixed‐effect repeated measure model (MMRM). Adverse events and suicidality were tracked throughout the study (NCT03537014). Results: Of 131 participants, 91 were randomized to MDMA (n=46 treated, 91.3% completed) or placebo (n=44, 84.0% completed). Participants were 59% female and 27% LGBTQI.

Socioemotional processing alterations such as those documented here might underlie possible psychotherapeutic benefits of this drug; further investigation of such mechanisms could inform treatment design to maximize active components of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.08.003", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20947066/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

METHOD: Data from 205 intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) in 97 participants with DSM-IV-defined major depressive disorder (MDD) were pooled from 3 clinical trials conducted between 2006 and 2012 at 2 academic medical centers. Safety and tolerability measures included attrition, adverse events (AEs), hemodynamic changes, and assessments of psychosis and dissociation. RESULTS: The overall antidepressant response rate, defined as a ≥ 50% improvement in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score, was 67% (65 of 97 participants). Four of 205 infusions (1.95%) were discontinued due to AEs. The overall attrition rate was 3.1% (3 of 97).

PTSD is a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering. This study will examine whether two six to eight‐hour long sessions of 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled three to five weeks apart are safe, and whether combining a fully therapeutic dose of MDMA with psychotherapy, compared with a low (\"active placebo\") dose of MDMA, will reduce PTSD symptoms, with symptoms measured four times, twice during the study, and during two follow‐up assessments six and twelve months after the second experimental session. People who received the active placebo dose of MDMA can then take part in an \"open label\" study continuation, with the participant receiving a fully active dose of MDMA on two more six to eight hour‐long psychotherapy sessions. Open‐label means that the participants and the researchers know that the participant will receive the fully active dose of MDMA. People who receive the full dose of MDMA, and anyone who received low‐dose MDMA and does not undergo the open‐label study continuation will have PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second fully active or low dose MDMA session. People who take part in the open label study continuation have their PTSD symptoms checked six and 12 months after the second open label MDMA‐assisted session. MDMA is a substance that has unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA may belong to a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled in the US and Israel, and doctors and therapists cannot give it to people outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD, and there is an ongoing placebo‐controlled study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in people with crime or war‐related PTSD occurring in the US. This study will look at MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 12 individuals aged 18 years or older diagnosed with PTSD that arose out of war or terrorism‐related trauma, with PTSD symptoms not improving after trying at least one treatment. Eight of 12 participants will be assigned to receive the full dose of MDMA, and four will be assigned to receive a low or \"active placebo\" dose of MDMA during each of two experimental sessions. People will be assigned to full or low‐dose MDMA \"by chance,\" as by flipping a coin. The fully active dose consists of an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg given 2 to 2.5 hours later. The active placebo dose consists of an initial dose of 25 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 12.5 mg. The study will last approximately four months, and will include two sixty minute long introductory psychotherapy sessions, two active placebo or fully active dose MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy sessions, a sixty to ninety minute long psychotherapy session 24 hours after each experimental session, and one to two hour‐long psychotherapy sessions occurring weekly between the first and second experimental session, and between the second experimental session and the end of the study. PTSD symptoms will be measured at the start of the study and eight weeks (two months) after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are assessed six and twelve months after the second experimental session in people who do not take part in the open‐label study continuation. People who take part in the open‐label study continuation will have their PTSD symptoms measured six and twelve months after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00402298", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.", "doi": "10.2165/11584550-000000000-00000", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21456632/", "secondary_title": "Clin Pharmacokinet", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates.

Short surveys will be collected once weekly three days after the administration of psilocybin/placebo, and follow‐ups will occur for up to two years following the beginning of the trial. Using this design will maximize the experimental power to detect an effect if one exists and would inform future research on microdosing in terms of duration, effect size, and expectancy bias.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05259943", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Acute Effects of MDMA on Intrinsic Functional Connectomes Associated With Altered States of Consciousness and Defensiveness.^\nBackground: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), a serotonin releaser, reduces interpersonal defensiveness but is also thought to open a “critical period” in the brain in which alterations in consciousness may enhance a therapeutic process. However, the relationship between MDMA‐induced effects on brain connectomes and these altered states has not been directly examined. Methods: In a novel, double‐blinded, randomized, cross‐over design, 17 healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years (mean=40.8 years, 62.5% female) received two doses of MDMA (120mg or 80mg), as well as placebo, 10 days apart. Resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging was collected ∼90 minutes post‐drug administration. Whole‐brain pairwise functional connectivity (FC) was calculated using the Brainnetome atlas. MDMA‐induced experiences were assessed using 5‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) and self‐reports. Results: MDMA induced dose‐dependent increases in FC globally in the cortex, particularly involving default, attention, and somatomotor networks, and decreases locally in subcortical regions including amygdala, striatum, hippocampus, and thalamic subnuclei (network‐based statistic corrected, pFWE<0.05).

Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, has been shown to have rapid antisuicidal effect and antidepressant qualities, and is thus a promising intervention to target acute suicidality in patients with BD. However, the biological mechanism underlying its therapeutic action remains poorly understood. Enhancing our understanding of underlying mechanisms of action for ketamine's effectiveness in reducing suicidality is critical to establishing biological markers of treatment response and developing tailored, personalized interventions for patients with BD. OBJECTIVE: This is an open-label clinical trial to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions to treat acute suicidality. The primary objective is to test the safety and feasibility of ketamine intervention. The secondary objective is to examine ketamine's potential neurophysiological mechanisms of action by assessing cortical excitation and inhibition to determine potential biomarkers of clinical response. Other objectives are to evaluate the effect of ketamine on acute suicidality and other clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms and quality of life, to inform a future larger trial. METHODS: This open-label clinical trial aims to test the safety and feasibility of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with BD for suicidality and to assess ketamine's neurophysiological effects. A sterile form of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered over a 40-minute intravenous infusion 2 times per week on nonconsecutive days for 4 weeks (8 sessions). We will recruit 30 adults (24-65 year olds) over 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study is currently ongoing and actively recruiting participants. So far, 5 participants have completed the trial, 1 is currently in active treatment, and 8 participants are on the waitlist to be screened. We anticipate initial results being available in the fall of 2023. This proposal was presented as a poster presentation at the Research to Reality Global Summit on Psychedelic-Assisted Therapies and Medicine, held in May 2022 in Toronto, Canada. CONCLUSIONS: Developing effective interventions for acute suicidality in high-risk populations such as those with BD remains a major therapeutic challenge. Ketamine is a promising treatment due to its rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, but its underlying neurophysiological mechanisms of action remain unknown.

Background 1.1 Major depressive disorder (MDD) MDD is a clinical syndrome characterized by the presence of low modo, anhedonia, appetite and weight changes, sleep disturbances, psychomotor alterations, fatigue, guilt and low self‐esteem, ideas related to death or suicide, and concentration difficulties. MDD represents one of the first causes of disability worldwide. In Mexico, prevalence is estimated in 7.2% of the population. In accordance to the largest clinical trial of MDD, the STAR*D (Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression), up to one third of the patients will not achieve remission after 4 treatment strategies. These obligates research of new treatments for MDD and treatment‐resistant depression TRD. 1.2 Treatment‐resistant Depression (TRD) There is a lack of consensus to define TRD, with multiple criteria used by distinct authors. However, the most used definition is the failure to achieve response or remission after two consecutive treatments at an adequate dose and duration, considering the last episode. 1.3 Physiopathology of MDD. Historically, serotonin and noradrenaline disturbances in production, metabolism and reuptake have been implicated in MDD, as well as dopamine. However, this hypothesis seems insufficient in explaining the lack of immediate response, and the lack of response of up to one third of patients. It is necessary to understand MDD as a multifactorial disorder (biological, psychological, and environmental agents). At a genetic level, some polymorphisms have been related to the appearance of MDD, such as the gen associated with the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, the one related to the monoaminooxidase‐A, and the one related to the glucogen kinase‐synthase 3. Heredability for MDD has been calculated around 37%. In a molecular basis, there are three principal factors implicated in the genesis of MDD: neurotrophic factors such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1 beta, 6, tumoral necrosis factor alpha), and a dysregulation in the hypothalamus‐hypophysis‐adrenal axis. Anatomically speaking, the majority of neuroimaging studies converge in the existence of a hyperactive amygdala, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex to negative stimuli. Among regions of major interest are the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus in its subgenual area and anterior or pregenual area (pgACC), ventral striatum, medial thalamus, posterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insulae. 1.5 Glutamate and GABA in MDD y GABA Glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction in affective disorders has increased interest in the last years, evidenced by clinical neuroimaging studies that demonstrate disturbances in such systems in patients with MDD, animal models of stress, and the role of glucocorticoids in the glutamatergic regulation secondary to chronic stress, as well as studies about the action of antidepressants in these systems. 1.6 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy H1‐MRS in MDD H1‐MRS studies coincide with the diminution of glutamate, glutamine and Glx (a composite measure of the previous two) in patients with MDD compared to controls in the pgCCA. Such finding has been correlated with the severity of MDD and anomalous connectivity with the anterior insulae. pgACC activity has been shown to be a predictor of response of some depression treatments such as pharmacological treatments and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Because of these findings, it is of great interest for the investigators to study this region in relation to ketamine interventions as an antidepressant therapy. Its clinical effects make ketamine a candidate to solve problems related to MDD in public health, confirmed by various systematic reviews and meta‐analysis. 2.1 Key questions Disturbed GABA neurotransmission has been also found in the occipital cortex in patients with MDD and TRD, suggesting a possible biomarker for differential diagnosis. Specifically in TRD patients, Glx in pgACC have been found to be altered, however more studies are needed. 1. pgACC in MDD pgACC in MDD refers to the rostral portion of the ACC that englobes the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, nominated sometimes as the medial prefrontal cortex. It comprises Brodmann's areas 24, 25, 32 and 33. The pgACC corresponds to the area 33. Through models of meta‐analytic connectivity, its role in the production of interception and subjective feelings, coordinating responses appropriate to internal and external events along with the insulae, and its involvement in the representation of interoceptive information have been confirmed. It seems also to represent the area in with the distinction of cognition and affect takes place39. Such function is supported by evidence of structures connected to the pgACC (lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and limbic regions). Functional MRI (fMRI), has demonstrated an increased connectivty between pgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as a diminution in the connectivity of the pgACC and caudate. Such findings may be explained by an intense cognitive control over emotional regulation in MDD patients. There is evidence of abnormal glutamatergic abnormalities in cerebral activity in resting state in MDD patients, finding a correlation between lower glutamate levels in the pgACC and a diminished connectivity of the same area with the anterior insulae compared to controls through H1‐MRS and BOLD techniques. 1.9 Ketamine as an antidepressant Ever since the first clinical study reporting the use of ketamine as an antidepressant for TRD patients, showing a rapid (in hours) and robust (in days) response after a unique administration, the literature has grown exponentially. However, mechanisms of action remain inconclusive. Its antidepressant properties have been vinculated by ketamine's capacity to stimulate the release and expression of BDNF. Contrary to the result of chronic stress, inhibiting these results, ketamine seems to stimulate it. This molecule is involved in the modulation of neuroplasticity, specifically in the prefrontal cortices. Another of the explanations in a molecular level has been its regulation in the glycogen kinase‐synthase 3 (GSK3), required for the pruning and synaptic reconsolidation50. Finally, ketamine has been shown to regulate the lateral habenula (implicated in MDD), probably also explaining its role in the down‐regulation of monoamines. There are clinical trials reporting the efficacy of repeated administrations of ketamine (from 7 days up to 83 days after the last administration) with IV ketamine and intranasal esketamine. However, studies vary in the number of interventions, intervals, conditions to continue treatment, times of measurements, follow‐up, making it impossible to obtain standardized results. Also, repeated doses have not been reported with H1‐MRS technique to explore if there are durable changes after chronic administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in MDD. 3. Will this response, if achieved, be different than changes in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC among patients receiving placebo? 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Design A double‐blind randomized clinical trial (initially) will be performed, followed by an open‐label trial. Subjects treated in the NINN will be divided in two groups: 1. Subjects with TRD, receiving ketamine infusions from start. 2. Subjects with TRD, receiving placebo (saline solution 0.9%), and afterwards 3.3 Procedure 1. Sampling. 2. Previous evaluation: 1. Psychiatric evaluation (HDRS‐17, MADRS). 2. Medical evaluation 1.10 Glutamatergic and GABAergic chances in pgACC before ketamine administration H1‐MRS data concerning glutamate levels in healthy subjects show that after ketamine administration, there is a significative increase in glutamate in the pgACC, correlating with psychopathology scales such as the PANSS, supporting the idea that ketamine exerts an important effect in the neurotransmission related to its mechanism of action in this region of interest. Such findings propose the difference in this region of interest pre and postinfusion of ketamine and repr sent an important antecedent for the current proposal. In a similar way, in healthy subjects, hippocampal augments of Glx and a decreased of the fronto‐temporal connectivity and temporo‐parietal after the administration measured at 10 minutes after ketamine administration has been shown. When measuring glutamate, Glx and GABA in the pgACC after ketamine in MDD patients, there have been mixed results. Some authors have found a significative increase of the same, correlating with clinical response when measuring during the infusion53. However, using major tesla MRI and measuring the effect of ketamine in glutamate at 24 hours after administration show no differences against placebo. Both findings are discussed concerning the time of measure, concluding that there is a rapid and robust increase, but a transitory one. However these changes do not persist. To our knowledge no H1‐MRS studies after a series of ketamine infusions to know if there are durable changes in glutamate of GABA levels that may explain the durable antidepressant effects of ketamine. 1.11 Experience in the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (NINN), Mexico Clinical experience with ketamine as an antidepressant and augmentation agent to conventional antidepressants has shown similar clinical results as reported previously, and even have shown longer times until relapse. There is extensive experience in the utilization of H1‐MRS in other disorders. The investigators consider that this institution is ideal for the development of the current proposal. 1. Will patients with TRD have a clinical response (50%) after the infusion of ketamine as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the first 24 hours, and different to patients receiving placebo? 2. Will TRD patients presenting response, present a significant increase in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC measured by H1‐MRS 24 hours after the last intervention, compared to the basal measure? 3.2 Sample During the sample selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria defined afterwards will be used. Sampling will be non‐probabilistic in a consecutive case manner. Patients will participate voluntarily after informed consent is achieved. 3. Randomization 4. Basal 1H‐MRS for GABA: 5. Basal 1H‐MRS for Glutamate: Similar to the GABA acquisition. 6. Interventions 1. All interventions will be done as an out‐patient basis by a psychiatrist. 2. A 0.5 mg/kg infusion of ketamine or placebo IV along 40 minutes will be performed. Vigilance will be strict (vital signs, adverse effects, subjective experience, clinimetry). 3. After every intervention, the patient will be observed for 1 hour or more if considered necessary by the clinician, returning to their normal routine afterward. 4. Such intervention will be done twice weekly in a prior of 4 weeks (day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27) for a total of 8 infusions in patients receiving ketamine. 5.

However, this hypothesis seems insufficient in explaining the lack of immediate response, and the lack of response of up to one third of patients. It is necessary to understand MDD as a multifactorial disorder (biological, psychological, and environmental agents). At a genetic level, some polymorphisms have been related to the appearance of MDD, such as the gen associated with the glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1, the one related to the monoaminooxidase‐A, and the one related to the glucogen kinase‐synthase 3. Heredability for MDD has been calculated around 37%. In a molecular basis, there are three principal factors implicated in the genesis of MDD: neurotrophic factors such as brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), proinflammatory cytokines (interleukin‐1 beta, 6, tumoral necrosis factor alpha), and a dysregulation in the hypothalamus‐hypophysis‐adrenal axis. Anatomically speaking, the majority of neuroimaging studies converge in the existence of a hyperactive amygdala, ventral striatum and medial prefrontal cortex to negative stimuli. Among regions of major interest are the amygdala, prefrontal cortex, the cingulate gyrus in its subgenual area and anterior or pregenual area (pgACC), ventral striatum, medial thalamus, posterior cingulate gyrus and anterior insulae. 1.5 Glutamate and GABA in MDD y GABA Glutamatergic and GABAergic dysfunction in affective disorders has increased interest in the last years, evidenced by clinical neuroimaging studies that demonstrate disturbances in such systems in patients with MDD, animal models of stress, and the role of glucocorticoids in the glutamatergic regulation secondary to chronic stress, as well as studies about the action of antidepressants in these systems. 1.6 Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy H1‐MRS in MDD H1‐MRS studies coincide with the diminution of glutamate, glutamine and Glx (a composite measure of the previous two) in patients with MDD compared to controls in the pgCCA. Such finding has been correlated with the severity of MDD and anomalous connectivity with the anterior insulae. pgACC activity has been shown to be a predictor of response of some depression treatments such as pharmacological treatments and transcranial magnetic stimulation. Because of these findings, it is of great interest for the investigators to study this region in relation to ketamine interventions as an antidepressant therapy. Its clinical effects make ketamine a candidate to solve problems related to MDD in public health, confirmed by various systematic reviews and meta‐analysis. 2.1 Key questions Disturbed GABA neurotransmission has been also found in the occipital cortex in patients with MDD and TRD, suggesting a possible biomarker for differential diagnosis. Specifically in TRD patients, Glx in pgACC have been found to be altered, however more studies are needed. 1. pgACC in MDD pgACC in MDD refers to the rostral portion of the ACC that englobes the anterior portion of the corpus callosum, nominated sometimes as the medial prefrontal cortex. It comprises Brodmann's areas 24, 25, 32 and 33. The pgACC corresponds to the area 33. Through models of meta‐analytic connectivity, its role in the production of interception and subjective feelings, coordinating responses appropriate to internal and external events along with the insulae, and its involvement in the representation of interoceptive information have been confirmed. It seems also to represent the area in with the distinction of cognition and affect takes place39. Such function is supported by evidence of structures connected to the pgACC (lateral and ventromedial prefrontal cortices, and limbic regions). Functional MRI (fMRI), has demonstrated an increased connectivty between pgACC and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, as well as a diminution in the connectivity of the pgACC and caudate. Such findings may be explained by an intense cognitive control over emotional regulation in MDD patients. There is evidence of abnormal glutamatergic abnormalities in cerebral activity in resting state in MDD patients, finding a correlation between lower glutamate levels in the pgACC and a diminished connectivity of the same area with the anterior insulae compared to controls through H1‐MRS and BOLD techniques. 1.9 Ketamine as an antidepressant Ever since the first clinical study reporting the use of ketamine as an antidepressant for TRD patients, showing a rapid (in hours) and robust (in days) response after a unique administration, the literature has grown exponentially. However, mechanisms of action remain inconclusive. Its antidepressant properties have been vinculated by ketamine's capacity to stimulate the release and expression of BDNF. Contrary to the result of chronic stress, inhibiting these results, ketamine seems to stimulate it. This molecule is involved in the modulation of neuroplasticity, specifically in the prefrontal cortices. Another of the explanations in a molecular level has been its regulation in the glycogen kinase‐synthase 3 (GSK3), required for the pruning and synaptic reconsolidation50. Finally, ketamine has been shown to regulate the lateral habenula (implicated in MDD), probably also explaining its role in the down‐regulation of monoamines. There are clinical trials reporting the efficacy of repeated administrations of ketamine (from 7 days up to 83 days after the last administration) with IV ketamine and intranasal esketamine. However, studies vary in the number of interventions, intervals, conditions to continue treatment, times of measurements, follow‐up, making it impossible to obtain standardized results. Also, repeated doses have not been reported with H1‐MRS technique to explore if there are durable changes after chronic administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in MDD. 3. Will this response, if achieved, be different than changes in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC among patients receiving placebo? 3. METHODOLOGY 3.1 Design A double‐blind randomized clinical trial (initially) will be performed, followed by an open‐label trial. Subjects treated in the NINN will be divided in two groups: 1. Subjects with TRD, receiving ketamine infusions from start. 2. Subjects with TRD, receiving placebo (saline solution 0.9%), and afterwards 3.3 Procedure 1. Sampling. 2. Previous evaluation: 1. Psychiatric evaluation (HDRS‐17, MADRS). 2. Medical evaluation 1.10 Glutamatergic and GABAergic chances in pgACC before ketamine administration H1‐MRS data concerning glutamate levels in healthy subjects show that after ketamine administration, there is a significative increase in glutamate in the pgACC, correlating with psychopathology scales such as the PANSS, supporting the idea that ketamine exerts an important effect in the neurotransmission related to its mechanism of action in this region of interest. Such findings propose the difference in this region of interest pre and postinfusion of ketamine and repr sent an important antecedent for the current proposal. In a similar way, in healthy subjects, hippocampal augments of Glx and a decreased of the fronto‐temporal connectivity and temporo‐parietal after the administration measured at 10 minutes after ketamine administration has been shown. When measuring glutamate, Glx and GABA in the pgACC after ketamine in MDD patients, there have been mixed results. Some authors have found a significative increase of the same, correlating with clinical response when measuring during the infusion53. However, using major tesla MRI and measuring the effect of ketamine in glutamate at 24 hours after administration show no differences against placebo. Both findings are discussed concerning the time of measure, concluding that there is a rapid and robust increase, but a transitory one. However these changes do not persist. To our knowledge no H1‐MRS studies after a series of ketamine infusions to know if there are durable changes in glutamate of GABA levels that may explain the durable antidepressant effects of ketamine. 1.11 Experience in the National Institute of Neurology and Neurosurgery (NINN), Mexico Clinical experience with ketamine as an antidepressant and augmentation agent to conventional antidepressants has shown similar clinical results as reported previously, and even have shown longer times until relapse. There is extensive experience in the utilization of H1‐MRS in other disorders. The investigators consider that this institution is ideal for the development of the current proposal. 1. Will patients with TRD have a clinical response (50%) after the infusion of ketamine as measured by the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) during the first 24 hours, and different to patients receiving placebo? 2. Will TRD patients presenting response, present a significant increase in Glutamate and GABA in the pgACC measured by H1‐MRS 24 hours after the last intervention, compared to the basal measure? 3.2 Sample During the sample selection, inclusion and exclusion criteria defined afterwards will be used. Sampling will be non‐probabilistic in a consecutive case manner. Patients will participate voluntarily after informed consent is achieved. 3. Randomization 4. Basal 1H‐MRS for GABA: 5. Basal 1H‐MRS for Glutamate: Similar to the GABA acquisition. 6. Interventions 1. All interventions will be done as an out‐patient basis by a psychiatrist. 2. A 0.5 mg/kg infusion of ketamine or placebo IV along 40 minutes will be performed. Vigilance will be strict (vital signs, adverse effects, subjective experience, clinimetry). 3. After every intervention, the patient will be observed for 1 hour or more if considered necessary by the clinician, returning to their normal routine afterward. 4. Such intervention will be done twice weekly in a prior of 4 weeks (day 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 19, 23, and 27) for a total of 8 infusions in patients receiving ketamine. 5. At day 15, the trial will be no longer blind and: i. In case of having received placebo, they may elect to receive the 8 infusions of ketamine. ii. In case of having received ketamine, they will continue until completing 8 infusions. 7. Posterior evaluation 1. Psychiatric evaluation as explained earlier at 4, 24, 72 hours and weekly up to 12 weeks after the last infusion of relapse. 2. Glutamate and GABA in pgACC measures with the parameters after 10 minutes of starting the infusion, 24 hours after, and 1 week after the last infusion of ketamine or placebo. 8. Follow‐up a. 12‐week follow‐up after last intervention or relapse, after which patients will end participation and their care will continue as usual.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03742557", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}
