"7414","Ketamine or Placebo in Patients with Major Depressive Disorder Undergoing Palliative Care: preliminary Results from the KODIAC Trial.^\nBackground/aims: To report preliminary results from the KODIAC study, designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous ketamine for patients with cancer diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) and undergoing palliative care (PC). Methods: KODIAC is a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist. The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale (BEDS) 3 weeks post‐intervention. This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04471818). Results: Currently, 50% of the calculated sample has been accrued. Eight patients (n=4 controls; n=4 experimental) completed the study. Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups, as well as baseline BEDS scores. Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention. At three weeks post intervention, patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm (3 [SD: 2.160] vs. 11.75 [SD:3.594]; p=0.006). The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care. These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population, warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent.","0"
"8947","Anterior default mode network and posterior insular connectivity is predictive of depressive symptom reduction following serial ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a rapidly-acting antidepressant treatment with robust response rates. Previous studies have reported that serial ketamine therapy modulates resting state functional connectivity in several large-scale networks, though it remains unknown whether variations in brain structure, function, and connectivity impact subsequent treatment success. We used a data-driven approach to determine whether pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging measures predict changes along symptom dimensions of depression following serial ketamine infusion. METHODS: Patients with depression (n = 60) received structural, resting state functional, and diffusion MRI scans before treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C), and the Rumination Response Scale (RRS) before and 24 h after patients received four (0.5 mg/kg) infusions of racemic ketamine over 2 weeks. Nineteen unaffected controls were assessed at similar timepoints. Random forest regression models predicted symptom changes using pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging and demographic measures. RESULTS: Two HDRS-17 subscales, the HDRS-6 and core mood and anhedonia (CMA) symptoms, and the RRS: reflection (RRSR) scale were predicted significantly with 19, 27, and 1% variance explained, respectively. Increased right medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate and posterior insula (PoI) and lower kurtosis of the superior longitudinal fasciculus predicted reduced HDRS-6 and CMA symptoms following treatment. RRSR change was predicted by global connectivity of the left posterior cingulate, left insula, and right superior parietal lobule. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that connectivity of the anterior default mode network and PoI may serve as potential biomarkers of antidepressant outcomes for core depressive symptoms.","6"
"3909","The Impact of Psilocybin on Patients Experiencing Psychiatric Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of psilocybin on patients experiencing psychiatric symptoms, with a focus on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety. METHOD OF RESEARCH: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched the PubMed database and identified studies published from January 2011 to December 2021 pertaining to the impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms. Two authors independently conducted a focused analysis and reached a final consensus on five studies meeting the specific selection criteria. Study bias was addressed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: The impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms was examined in five randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies administered 1 to 2 doses of psilocybin, with doses ranging from 14mg/70kg to 30mg/70kg, and one study administered a fixed dose of 25mg to all participants. Administration of psilocybin resulted in significant and sustained reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhanced sense of wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive mood immediately after psilocybin administration and up to six months after conclusion of treatment. All studies included some form of psychotherapy, and none reported serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: RCTs show the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as improvement in HRQoL, and no serious side effects. However, additional research is necessary to characterize predictors of treatment response, patient screening requirements, effectiveness in broader clinical populations, and guidelines for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.","8"
"1437","Cognitive function of patients with treatment-resistant depression after a single low dose of ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function.","6"
"5705","D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","3"
"9038","Visuo-spatial working memory deficits in current and former users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nVerbal working memory and executive deficits have been observed in ecstasy users. The present study sought to establish whether these also extended to visuo-spatial working memory. Thirty-six current ecstasy users, 12 former users (abstinent for at least 6 months) and 31 individuals that had never used ecstasy were tested on a maintenance plus type visuo-spatial working memory task. The task required participants to recall a sequence of specially marked cells in a four-by-four matrix display while at the same time performing a concurrent visual judgement task. Both the current and former user groups registered impairments relative to nonusers. These remained significant following statistical controls for a range of potentially confounding variables including the use of various other drugs during the 3 months prior to testing. Users were unimpaired on a simple spatial span measure suggesting that the deficits observed reflected the executive aspects of the spatial working memory task. Also consistent with executive involvement, statistical controls for measures of verbal working memory performance (computation span) removed half of the ecstasy-related variance in spatial working memory. The possibility that the pattern of results obtained might reflect some general impairment in information processing efficiency is discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","6"
"6644","The effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of eeg changes in human volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5‐HT2A/C and 5‐HT1A receptors. It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding. The connectivity analyses showed biphasic effect on overall connectivity indicating two different connectivity states at the peak of intoxication and 6 hours after the ingestion. Results will be discussed in relation to the potential therapeutic effects of psilocybin.","0"
"6366","Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects, and many patients also describe dissociation, which is associated with antidepressant response. This follow-up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters. METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n = 126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Antidepressant response was measured using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D). A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change. A significant effect of derealization on HAM-D percent change was observed at one timepoint (Day 7) in one study. The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM-D percent change. LIMITATIONS: Possible inadequate blinding; combined MDD/BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine's antidepressant efficacy; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses. CONCLUSIONS: From a psychometric perspective, researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale, given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response. From a neurobiological perspective, mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine-induced depersonalization and antidepressant response, although off-target effects cannot be excluded.","1"
"6427","NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia: an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI.^\nBACKGROUND: Based on animal data, NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia. NMDA receptor hypofunction affects several corticolimbic brain regions, of which the posterior cingulate seems to be the most sensitive. However, empirical support for a crucial role of posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms is still missing in humans. We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval, which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate. METHODS: We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either placebo (n = 7; saline) or ketamine (n = 9; 0.6 mg/kg/h) group in a double-blind study design. All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic memory retrieval task in the scanner. Immediately after the fMRI session, psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. RESULTS: The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and anterior cingulate during retrieval. Signal increases were significantly lower in the ketamine group. Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated significantly with positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms induced by ketamine. CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship between NMDA receptors, posterior cingulate and positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms in humans. Confirming findings from animal studies, it supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia.","0"
"7379","Serotonergic hallucinogens and recognition of facial emotion expressions: a systematic review of the literature.^\nBACKGROUND: Recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a key aspect of social cognition. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with deficits in REFE, and anxiolytics and antidepressants reverse these deficits. Recent studies have shown that serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], and mescaline) have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, but their effects on REFE are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans. METHODS: Studies published in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases until 19 October 2018 which analyzed the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans were included. RESULTS: Of the 62 studies identified, 8 studies were included. Included studies involved the administration of a single or a few doses of LSD or psilocybin, and most trials were randomized and controlled with placebo. LSD and psilocybin reduced the recognition of negative emotions in most studies and modulated amygdala activity to these stimuli, which was correlated with antidepressive effects in patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogens reduced the recognition of negative emotions by modulating amygdala activity. Despite the small sample sizes, results suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens show promising beneficial effects on deficits in REFE.","8"
"1692","Predicting changes in substance use following psychedelic experiences: natural language processing of psychedelic session narratives.^\nBackground: Experiences with psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are sometimes followed by changes in patterns of tobacco, opioid, and alcohol consumption. But, the specific characteristics of psychedelic experiences that lead to changes in drug consumption are unknown. Objective: Determine whether quantitative descriptions of psychedelic experiences derived using Natural Language Processing (NLP) would allow us to predict who would quit or reduce using drugs following a psychedelic experience. Methods: We recruited 1141 individuals (247 female, 894 male) from online social media platforms who reported quitting or reducing using alcohol, cannabis, opioids, or stimulants following a psychedelic experience to provide a verbal narrative of the psychedelic experience they attributed as leading to their reduction in drug use. We used NLP to derive topic models that quantitatively described each participant’s psychedelic experience narrative. We then used the vector descriptions of each participant’s psychedelic experience narrative as input into three different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict long-term drug reduction outcomes. Results: We found that the topic models derived through NLP led to quantitative descriptions of participant narratives that differed across participants when grouped by the drug class quit as well as the long-term quit/reduction outcomes. Additionally, all three machine learning algorithms led to similar prediction accuracy (~65%, CI = ±0.21%) for long-term quit/reduction outcomes. Conclusions: Using machine learning to analyze written reports of psychedelic experiences may allow for accurate prediction of quit outcomes and what drug is quit or reduced within psychedelic therapy.","10"
"2017","Rapid relief of treatment resistant depression by facilitated ketamine infusion: A preliminary report.^\nBy combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with intravenous ketamine therapy, we sought to increase the therapeutic value of TMS and, at the same time, to improve the efficacy of intravenous ketamine therapy among depressed patients previously classified as non-responders. In this preliminary report, we provide evidence for a new and much more reliable method of treating patients with treatment resistant depression. Twenty-eight patients with various degrees of treatment unresponsive depression were treated with a combination of TMS and ketamine infusion. Of these patients, twenty received pretreatment for 3 days to 2 weeks involving intensive (thrice daily) rTMS treatment administered 6 or 7 days/week or priming TMS treatment immediately prior to the combination TMSketamine infusion combination therapy. Eight patients received neither pretreatment nor priming. All of the 28 patients who did fully participate in the first month of treatment experienced relief of psychiatric symptoms, and showed significant psychosocial recovery. In contrast to previous studies examining ketamine or rTMS individually, the positive outcomes presented here suggest a synergistic effect of the combination therapy of TMS and ketamine infusion.","3"
"7078","A Novel, Brief, Fully Automated Intervention to Extend the Antidepressant Effect of a Single Ketamine Infusion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse depression by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity. The authors tested whether an automated, computer-based approach could efficiently leverage enhanced neuroplasticity to extend the durability of rapid clinical response. METHODS: A total of 154 adults (ages 18-60) with treatment-resistant unipolar depression were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive an active/active treatment combination (ketamine plus active ""automated self-association training"" [ASAT]; N=53) or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug component (saline plus active ASAT; N=51) or the active behavioral component (ketamine plus sham ASAT; N=50). One day after a single infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or inert placebo (saline), active ASAT-targeting self-worth through automated ""evaluative conditioning"" training delivered by computer-or sham ASAT (consisting of identical computer tasks that included no positive or self-referential stimuli) was given, delivered twice daily over 4 consecutive days (eight sessions, ≤20 minutes per session). The prespecified primary outcome measure throughout the main (30-day) study period was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Ketamine rapidly and significantly reduced depression scores at 24 hours postinfusion (group-by-time interaction: standardized beta [β]=-1.30, 95% CI=-1.89, -0.70; t=-4.29, df=150). In intent-to-treat linear mixed models, depression scores in the ketamine+ASAT group remained significantly and stably low over the 30-day study period relative to those of the saline+ASAT group (β=-0.61, 95% CI=-0.95, -0.28; t=-3.62, df=148). By contrast, depression scores following ketamine+sham treatment followed a significant, increasing linear trajectory from 24 hours to 30 days, approaching the levels observed in the saline+ASAT group (group-by-time interaction relative to the saline+ASAT group: β=0.015, 95% CI=0.003, 0.03; t=2.35, df=568). CONCLUSIONS: After priming the brain with ketamine, training positive self-associations could provide an efficient, low-cost, portable, noninvasive, and highly dissemination-ready strategy for leveraging and extending ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects.","1"
"3899","Plasma drug concentrations and physiological measures in 'dance party' participants.^\nThe increasing use of (±) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the setting of large dance parties ('raves') and clubs has been the source of some concern, because of potential acute adverse events, and because animal studies suggest that MDMA has the potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons. However, it is not yet known whether MDMA, as used in the setting of dance parties, leads to plasma levels of MDMA that are associated with toxicity to 5-HT neurons in animals. The present study sought to address this question. Plasma MDMA concentrations, vital signs, and a variety of blood and urine measures were obtained prior to, and hours after, individuals attended a dance party. After the dance party, subjects were without clinical complaints, had measurable amounts of residual MDMA in plasma, and nearly half of the subjects also tested positive for methamphetamine, another amphetamine analog that has been shown to have 5-HT neurotoxic potential in animals. Plasma concentrations of MDMA did not correlate with self-reported use of 'ecstasy' and, in some subjects, overlapped with those that have been associated with 5-HT neurotoxicity in non-human primates. Additional subjects were likely to have had similar concentrations while at the dance party, when one considers the reported time of drug ingestion and the plasma half-life of MDMA in humans. Hematological and biochemical analyses were generally unremarkable. Moderate increases in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature were observed in the subjects with the highest MDMA plasma concentrations. These findings are consistent with epidemiological findings that most people who use MDMA at dance parties do not develop serious clinical complications, and suggest that some of these individuals may be at risk for developing MDMA-induced toxicity to brain serotonin neurons. © 2006 Nature Publishing Group All rights reserved.","9"
"3537","Gray matter volume of rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicts rapid antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nKetamine was recently approved for treatment resistant depression. However, despite its therapeutic potential, about 50% of patients do not show improvement under this therapy. In this prospective two-site study, we investigated baseline brain structural predictors for rapid symptom improvement after a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion. Furthermore, given the preclinical evidence and findings from a pilot study in a clinical population that ketamine induces rapid neuroplasticity, we performed an exploratory investigation of macroscopic changes 24 h post-treatment. T1-weighted MRI brain images from 33 depressed patients were acquired before and 24 h after a single ketamine infusion and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Additionally, we performed a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of structures that have previously been shown to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine: bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that greater baseline volume of the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) significantly predicts rapid symptom reduction. The right ACC showed the same association in the ROI analysis, while the other regions yielded no significant results. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed no volumetric changes 24 h after treatment. This is the first study reporting an association between pretreatment gray matter volume of the bilateral rACC and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Results are in line with previous investigations, which highlighted the potential of the rACC as a biomarker for response prediction to different antidepressant treatments. Ketamine-induced volumetric changes may be seen at later time points. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)","3"
"1745","Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nAbnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.","3"
"8878","Genetic influence of CYP2D6 on pharmacokinetics and acute subjective effects of LSD in a pooled analysis.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic substance that is used recreationally and investigated in psychiatric research. There are no pharmacogenetic studies on LSD. In vitro metabolic studies indicate that several cytochrome P450 (CYP) isoforms (e.g., CYP2D6, CYP1A2, and CYP2C9) are involved in LSD metabolism, but in vivo data are scarce. The present study examined the influence of genetic polymorphisms of CYP genes on the pharmacokinetics and acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. We identified common genetic variants of CYPs (CYP2D6, CYP1A2, CYP2C9, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) in 81 healthy subjects who were pooled from four randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind Phase 1 studies. We found that genetically determined CYP2D6 functionality significantly influenced the pharmacokinetics of LSD. Individuals with no functional CYP2D6 (i.e., poor metabolizers) had longer LSD half-lives and approximately 75% higher parent drug and main metabolite 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD area-under-the-curve blood plasma concentrations compared with carriers of functional CYP2D6. Non-functional CYP2D6 metabolizers also exhibited greater alterations of mind and longer subjective effect durations in response to LSD compared with functional CYP2D6 metabolizers. No effect on the pharmacokinetics or acute effects of LSD were observed with other CYPs. These findings indicate that genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6 significantly influence the pharmacokinetic and subjective effects of LSD. Given the potential therapeutic use of psychedelics, including LSD, the role of pharmacogenetic tests prior to LSD-assisted psychotherapy needs to be further investigated.","7"
"6909","Assessment of chronic exposure to MDMA in a group of consumers by segmental hair analysis.^\nThe suitability of segmental hair analysis of MDMA to monitor past chronic exposure to the drug was investigated in a follow-up study of ecstasy consumers. The purpose, among others, was to look for an objective biomarker of the history of drug consumption. Thirteen naturally colored hair samples were used to assess possible association between hair concentration of MDMA in 1-, 5-, and 9-cm segments and self-reported use in the last 1, 6, and 12 months. Agreement between the self-reported data given by the subjects on their ""ecstasy"" use in the previous month and MDMA hair concentration was good (r = 0.92) in all the examined subjects, with the exception of 2 individuals who declared a high consumption of the drug (12 tablets in the last month). When comparing the subjects' declaration of tablets consumed per month within the last 6 months, concordance with the hair MDMA values decreased and no correlation seemed to exist between the mean number of tablets consumed in the last 12 months and the concentration of MDMA in hair. However, when grouping subjects with a similar level of declared drug use (independently of whether in the previous month, last 6 months and last 12 months) and comparing the data with the mean MDMA concentrations found in the corresponding hair segments, an excellent level of agreement was found in groups of subjects consuming <5 tablets of MDMA per month (r = 0.93). Although the present findings were obtained from a small group of individuals and are intended as preliminary results, we can conclude that a cutoff of 0.5 ng MDMA per mg hair seems reasonable to assess drug consumption, unless the level of consumption was once per month in the last 12 months. Doubling the monthly consumption increases hair MDMA by around 1 ng/mg hair up to a level of 4 consumed tablets a month. It does not seem possible to draw definitive conclusions from higher concentrations in hair samples. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","0"
"1806","A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample.","3"
"5597","Therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin: Changes in amygdala and prefrontal functional connectivity during emotional processing after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has shown promise as a treatment for depression but its therapeutic mechanisms are not properly understood. In contrast to the presumed actions of antidepressants, we recently found increased amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open-label treatment with psilocybin (25 mg) in 19 patients with treatment-resistant depression, which correlated with treatment efficacy. AIMS: Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin, the present study extends this basic activation analysis. We hypothesised changed amygdala functional connectivity, more precisely decreased amygdala-ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity, during face processing after treatment with psilocybin. METHODS: Psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a classic face/emotion perception task, with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex time-series as physiological regressors. Average parameter estimates (beta weights) of significant clusters were correlated with clinical outcomes at one week. RESULTS: Results showed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex-right amygdala functional connectivity during face processing post- (versus pre-) treatment; this decrease was associated with levels of rumination at one week. This effect was driven by connectivity changes in response to fearful and neutral (but not happy) faces. Independent whole-brain analyses also revealed a post-treatment increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital-parietal cortices during face processing. CONCLUSION: These results are consistent with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional responsiveness on a neural and psychological level, which may be a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy. Future larger placebo-controlled studies are needed to examine the replicability of the current findings.","9"
"7055","Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment.","3"
"1455","Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nOBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.","1"
"2737","Electroconvulsive therapy in the treatment of depression in a former ecstasy user.^\nDepression in former ecstasy users may not respond to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) possibly due to damaged serotonergic synapses following long-term heavy ecstasy use. We report findings in a patient suffering from MDMA-induced depression which was refractory to several antidepressive medications including selective noradrenergic reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) and SSRI. An add-on repeated bilateral electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was able to achieve a stable remission of affective and cognitive symptoms with a follow-up of more than 1.5 years. Add-on ECT could be a treatment option in former ecstasy users with severe depressive disorders that fail to respond to SSRI and/or SNRI. Clinical trials are needed to evaluate further the usefulness of ECT in this patient group.","0"
"2358","In vivo imaging of cerebral serotonin transporter and serotonin 2A receptor binding in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""Ecstasy"") and hallucinogen users.^\nContext: Both hallucinogens and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine ( MDMA or ""ecstasy"") have direct agonistic effects on postsynaptic serotonin2A receptors, the key site for hallucinogenic actions. In addition, MDMA is a potent releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. ©2011 American Medical Association.

"5317","An evaluation of a brief intervention model for use with young non-injecting stimulant users.^\nThis report describes the rationale, implementation, and efficacy evaluation of a brief, motivational intervention for young users of cocaine, crack cocaine, and ecstasy not in contact with treatment services. The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible. There were a range of positive changes reported by participants in both the experimental and control conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","2"
"8706","The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating, neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^\nRecently, much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) in sensory gating, such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential (ERP). Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores ""thinking disorder"" and ""withdrawal/retardation"" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further.","0"
"4579","Subanesthetic effects of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in humans. Psychotomimetic, perceptual, cognitive, and neuroendocrine responses.^\nBACKGROUND: To characterize further behavioral, cognitive, neuroendocrine, and physiological effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine hydrochloride in healthy human subjects. Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonists produce a broad range of symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits that resemble aspects of endogenous psychoses, particularly schizophrenia and dissociative states.","0"
"1364","Subcutaneous ketamine in depression: A systematic review.^\nBackground: Ketamine has been shown to produce a rapid and robust antidepressant effect. Though numerous routes of administration have been studied, subcutaneous (SC) has proven to be a convenient and cost-effective route making its use particularly relevant in developing countries. Here we provide a systematic review covering the use of SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression, including its efficacy, safety and tolerability. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out, from inception through March, 2021, using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, with no limits of language. After identifying 159 potentially relevant articles, 12 articles were selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria. These comprised two randomized clinical trials, five case-reports and five retrospective studies. Given the small number of studies found and their heterogeneous nature, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate. Here we provide a synthesis of these data including participant characteristics, dose range, efficacy, safety/ tolerability. Risk of bias was accessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: SC Ketamine was administered to unipolar and bipolar patients a single or multiple doses, weekly or twice-weekly, a dose-titration approach was made in major studies, dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/Kg of racemic ketamine and 0.5–1 mg/Kg of esketamine. Across all studies, SC ketamine showed a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, with response/ remission rates from 50 to 100% following both single or multiple doses, with transitory side effects. Conclusion: SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression is a promising strategy showing beneficial efficacy and tolerability. Future studies exploring the SC route, its cost-effectiveness, and a direct comparison with IV and intranasal (IN) protocols are warranted.

"8031","Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^\nBackground: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health. Future research should investigate the causal effects of classic psychedelics on physical health and evaluate possible mechanisms.","10"
"7545","Adolescent Substance Use Patterns and Risk for Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors in Young Adulthood.^\nOBJECTIVE: This paper focuses on the outcomes at one-year post-treatment of a naturalistic evaluation of services provided through the Takiwasi Centre, an accredited Peruvian therapeutic community offering an ayahuasca-assisted, integrative treatment program for addiction rehabilitation. METHODS: Participants (n=52) completed structured interviews and a battery of validated instruments. Outcome measures included the Addiction Severity Index (V. 5), the Beck Anxiety and Depression Inventories, the WHOQOL-BREF and the WHOQOL-SRPB. Likert rating scales were used to assess perceived importance and significance of different aspects of the program and overall participant satisfaction. RESULTS: The group change from baseline to the one-year follow up was significant and in the anticipated direction for alcohol and drug use severity, depression and anxiety, and some dimensions of quality of life. There was considerable individual variation in outcomes and treatment duration. The majority of participants rated all aspects of the program as important, including the spiritual and therapeutic significance of the ayahuasca experience which was rated as very significant. CONCLUSION: Based on the positive one-year outcomes, and within the limitations of an uncontrolled observational study design, the findings suggest promise for the effectiveness of the use of ayahuasca in a multifactorial treatment context for individuals with significant treatment histories, high levels of comorbidity and treatment motivation. Results highlight considerable variation in individual experience that merit in-depth qualitative analysis. Implications for ayahuasca-assisted and other psychedelic-assisted treatment alternatives are discussed.","4"
"4650","MDMA-induced indifference to negative sounds is mediated by the 5-HT(2A) receptor.^\nBACKGROUND: MDMA has been shown to induce feelings of sociability, a positive emotional bias and enhanced empathy. While previous research has used only visual emotional stimuli, communication entails more than that single dimension and it is known that auditory information is also crucial in this process. In addition, it is, however, unclear what the neurobiological mechanism underlying these MDMA effects on social behaviour is. Previously, studies have shown that MDMA-induced emotional excitability and positive mood are linked to the action on the serotonin (5-HT) 2A receptor. AIM: The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on processing of sounds (Processing of Affective Sounds Task (PAST)) and cognitive biases (Approach-Avoidance Task (AAT)) towards emotional and social stimuli and the role of 5-HT(2A) receptor in these effects. METHODS: Twenty healthy recreational users entered a 2 × 2, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with ketanserin (40 mg) as pre-treatment and MDMA (75 mg) as treatment. Behavioural (PAST, AAT) measures were conducted 90 min after treatment with MDMA, respectively, 120 min after ketanserin. Self-report mood measures and oxytocin concentrations were taken at baseline and before and after behavioural tests. RESULTS: Findings showed that MDMA reduced arousal elicited by negative sounds. This effect was counteracted by ketanserin pre-treatment, indicating involvement of the 5-HT(2) receptor in this process. MDMA did not seem to induce a bias towards emotional and social stimuli. It increased positive and negative mood ratings and elevated oxytocin plasma concentrations. The reduction in arousal levels when listening to negative sounds was not related to the elevated subjective arousal. CONCLUSION: It is suggested that this decrease in arousal to negative stimuli reflects potentially a lowering of defences, a process that might play a role in the therapeutic process.","0"

"4967","Autonomic, cardiovascular, and endocrine effects of LSD in healthy subjects.^\nIntroduction: LSD is used recreationally worldwide and there is renewed interest in using LSD in clinical psychiatric research and practice. However, there is limited data on the somatic and endocrine effects of LSD in humans. Method: LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over study. Cardiostimulant effects (blood pressure and heart rate), autonomic effects (body temperature and pupillary function), endocrine effects, and adverse effects were repeatedly assessed. Results: LSD induced positive mood, visual perceptual alterations, and audio‐visual synesthesia lasting for 12h. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD elevated the plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine but not norepinephrine. LSD impaired psychomotor performance (balance) and produced adverse side effects (difficulty concentrating, headache, exhaustion, dizziness) up to 24 h, which completely subsided within 72 h. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: The hallucinogen LSD produces significant sympathomimetic effects. The LSD‐induced increase in cortisol and prolactin is consistent with LSD's serotonergic properties. The cardiostimulant properties of LSD need to be considered in patients with hypertension or heart disease.","0"
"4587","Psychedelic experience dose-dependently modulated by cannabis: Results of a prospective online survey.^\nRationale: Classic psychedelics are currently being studied as novel treatments for a range of psychiatric disorders. However, research on how psychedelics interact with other psychoactive substances remains scarce. Objectives: The current study aimed to explore the subjective effects of psychedelics when used alongside cannabis. Methods: Participants (n = 321) completed a set of online surveys at 2 time points: 7 days before, and 1 day after a planned experience with a serotonergic psychedelic. The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual ‘setting’ variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

"980","Effect on opioids requirement of early administration of intranasal ketamine for acute traumatic pain.^\nObjectives: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of early administration of low-dose intranasal ketamine on reducing the need for opioid and nonopioid analgesic agents in emergency department (ED) patients with acute moderate to severe acute limbs’ trauma pain. Patients and Methods: This is a double-blind, randomized, prospective, controlled study conducted in the ED. The included patients were randomly assigned to intranasal pulverization of ketamine or placebo. Protocol treatment was given at the triage. The primary outcome is the need for opioids during ED stay. Secondary outcome included the requirement of nonopioid analgesic agents and the percentage of patients discharged from the ED with a visual analog scale (VAS) < 30. A combined outcome score including the 3 outcome items was constructed. Results: The authors included 1102 patients, 550 patients in the placebo group, and 552 in the intranasal ketamine group. The groups were similar regarding demographics, clinical characteristics, and baseline VAS. The need for opioids was decreased in the intranasal ketamine group compared with the placebo group (17.2% vs. 26.5%; P < 0.001). The need for nonopioid analgesics was significantly lower in the intranasal ketamine group compared with the placebo group (31.1% vs. 39.6%; P = 0.003). The percentage of patients discharged with a VAS score < 30 was significantly higher in the intranasal ketamine group (P < 0.001). The mean combined outcome score was 0.97 in the placebo group and 0.67 in the intranasal ketamine group (P < 0.001). Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine administered early in the triage was associated with a decrease in opioids and nonopioid analgesics need in patients with acute limb trauma-related pain.

"5680","Intravenous ketamine relieves pain and depression after traumatic suicide attempts: A case series.^\nThe letter presents a series of cases where, after traumatic suicide attempts, authors administered intravenous doses of ketamine to decrease pain and acute suicidal thoughts. The first case is an 81-year-old man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted neck laceration and left wrist laceration. On initial psychiatric consultation, it was discovered that the patient had been holding a delusional belief that he and his wife were developing dementia. After discussion with the patient, family, and surgical specialists, it was decided that the patient was not medically stable for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy was initiated to target symptoms of depression and psychosis using venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and aripiprazole on hospital day 3. The second case is also an elderly man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted bilateral orbit trauma. The treatment team decided to start him on venlafaxine and mirtazapine with a rapid titration to doses of 225 mg and 30 mg, respectively. In this set of 2 cases, we have provided strong evidence of the utility of intravenous ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and suicidal ideation after traumatic suicide attempts. This combines the traditional use of ketamine as an anesthetic with newly discovered antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. In these 2 cases, symptom relief was the desired outcome of treatment, and by this metric, the use of ketamine was a success in these patients in terms of management of pain, depression, and suicidality. Of note, both patients in this series were elderly and diagnosed as having MDD with psychotic features. These patients did not have any exacerbation of psychosis and rather appeared to lessen these symptoms, possibly by exerting treatment of their underlying depression. These treatments were given in the clinical setting, and outcomes were measured by clinicians and thus not subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny one would see in the setting of a clinical trial. This case series bolsters the ongoing discussion of how to best use intravenous administration of ketamine to treat psychiatric disorders, particularly when comorbid pain is present and/or ECT is unavailable.

"4291","From egoism to ecoism: Psychedelics increase nature relatedness in a state-mediated and context- dependent manner.^\n(1) Background: There appears to be a growing disconnection between humans and their natural environments which has been linked to poor mental health and ecological destruction. Previous research suggests that individual levels of nature relatedness can be increased through the use of classical psychedelic compounds, although a causal link between psychedelic use and nature relatedness has not yet been established. (2) Methods: Using correlations and generalized linear mixed regression modelling, we investigated the association between psychedelic use and nature relatedness in a prospective online study. Individuals planning to use a psychedelic received questionnaires 2 weeks before (N = 654), plus one day, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 2 years after a psychedelic experience. (3) Results: The frequency of lifetime psychedelic use was positively correlated with nature relatedness at baseline. Nature relatedness was significantly increased 2 weeks, 4 weeks and 2 years after the psychedelic experience. This increase was positively correlated with concomitant increases in psychological well-being and was dependent on the extent of ego-dissolution and the perceived influence of natural surroundings during the acute psychedelic state. (4) Conclusions: The here presented evidence for a context- and state-dependent causal effect of psychedelic use on nature relatedness bears relevance for psychedelic treatment models in mental health and, in the face of the current ecological crisis, planetary health.","5"
"5641","A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

"1649","Comparative study of esketamine and racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant depression: Protocol for a non-inferiority clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly, supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety. Esketamine, the S (+) enantiomer of ketamine, is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries, and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability. However, no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine. Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS/DESIGN: This study protocol is for a randomized, controlled, double-blind noninferiority clinical trial. Subjects will be 18 years or older, with major depression characterized as treatment-resistant. Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) or ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes. The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion. Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints, measurements of cognition, dissociation, and blood biomarkers. DISCUSSION: A head-to-head study is the best way to evaluate whether the esketamine is in fact comparable to the racemic ketamine in terms of both efficacy and safety, and, if positive, it would be an initial step to increase the access to that type of treatment worldwide. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study was approved by the local Institutional Review Board (University Hospital Professor Edgard Santos-Federal University of Bahia-Number: 46657415.0.0000.0049). Subjects will only participate after voluntarily agreeing and signing the Informed Consent Form. The study findings will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at national and international conferences. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been registered in the Japan Primary Registries Network (JPRN): UMIN000032355, which is affiliated with the World Health Organization.","9"
"6084","Role of the Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor in LSD-induced Altered States of Consciousness (LDR-Study).^\nSerotonin receptors, especially the 5HT2A receptor, are thought to be involved in the effects of various recreationally used psychedelic substances such as LSD. LSD potently stimulates the 5‐HT2A receptor but also 5‐HT2B/C, 5‐HT1 and dopaminergic receptors. LSD induces acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including visual perceptual alterations, audio‐visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization. LSD has therefore been used as experimental tool (""psychotomimetic"") in modern psychiatric research to study psychotic‐like states and model psychosis in healthy subjects [1‐5]. However, the dose‐effects of 5‐HT2A receptor stimulation by LSD has not yet been studied. Additionally, there is still very limited data to what extent the 5HT2A receptor contributes to LSD's effects and its role in the mediation of the full response to LSD at a high dose is unclear. A recent experimental human study showed the 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin fully blocked the subjective effects of a moderate dose of 100 µg of LSD [6]. But, whether the effects of a high 200 µg oral dose of LSD can be blocked by the selective pharmacological 5‐HT2A antagonist ketanserin remains to be tested to confirm the critical role of the 5‐HT2A receptor in more pronounced alterations of consciousness and perception. The present study therefore explores the role the 5‐HT2A receptor in LSD‐induced altered states of consciousness using escalating doses of LSD and the 5‐HT2A receptor blocker ketanserin administered before a high dose of LSD.","9"

The intervention is a combined pharmacological and psychological treatment. Dosing sessions The experimental drug is psilocybin, taken orally. There will be two dosing sessions approximately 3 weeks apart. Dose 1 = 25mg psilocybin; Dose 2 = 25 or 30mg psilocybin. Doses will be maintained at 25mg across both sessions unless the participant exhibits limited acute subjective response during the first session (as determined by acute effects questionnaires) without substantial adverse effects, in which case the dose will be increased to 30mg for the second session. A range of extraâ€pharmacological parameters are specified to optimise safety and efficacy. Psychotherapy The psychotherapy is conducted by qualified and experienced mental healthcare therapists who have also undergone an extensive trialâ€specific psychedelic therapist training program with supervised practice. All psychotherapy and dosing sessions will take part at BrainPark, Monash University, within comfortably furnished and aesthetically pleasing rooms.

"5906","Residual effects of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) on low level visual processes.^\n'Ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) induces impaired functioning in the serotonergic system, including the occipital lobe. This study employed the 'tilt aftereffect' paradigm to operationalise the function of orientation-selective neurons among ecstasy consumers and controls as a means of investigating the role of reduced serotonin on visual orientation processing. The magnitude of the tilt aftereffect reflects the extent of lateral inhibition between orientation-selective neurons and is elicited to both 'real' contours, processed in visual cortex area V1, and illusory contours, processed in V2. The magnitude of tilt aftereffect to both contour types was examined among 19 ecstasy users (6 ecstasy only; 13 ecstasy-plus-cannabis users) and 23 matched controls (9 cannabis-only users; 14 drug-naive). Ecstasy users had a significantly greater tilt magnitude than non-users for real contours (Hedge's g=0.63) but not for illusory contours (g=0.20). These findings provide support for literature suggesting that residual effects of ecstasy (and reduced serotonin) impairs lateral inhibition between orientation-selective neurons in V1, which however suggests that ecstasy may not substantially affect this process in V2. Multiple studies have now demonstrated ecstasy-related deficits on basic visual functions, including orientation and motion processing. Such low-level effects may contribute to the impact of ecstasy use on neuropsychological tests of visuospatial function. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","4"
"6901","Single and repeated ketamine infusions for reduction of suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression.^\nRepeated administration of subanesthetic intravenous ketamine may prolong the rapid decrease in suicidal ideation (SI) elicited by single infusions. The purpose of this secondary analysis was to evaluate reduction in SI with a single ketamine infusion compared with an active control, and prolonged suppression of SI with repeated and maintenance infusions. Thirty-seven participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and baseline SI first received a single ketamine infusion during a randomized, double-blind crossover with midazolam. Following relapse of depressive symptoms, participants received six open-label ketamine infusions administered thrice-weekly over 2 weeks. Antidepressant responders (≥50% decrease in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] scores) received four further open-label infusions administered once-weekly. Changes in SI were assessed with the suicide items on the MADRS (item 10, MADRS-SI) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (item 12, QIDS-SI). Linear mixed models revealed that compared with midazolam, a single ketamine infusion elicited larger reduction in SI (P = 0.01), with maximal effects measured at 7 days postinfusion (P < 0.001, Cohen's d = 0.83). Participants had cumulative reductions in MADRS-SI scores with repeated infusions (P < 0.001), and no further change with maintenance infusions (P = 0.94). QIDS-SI results were consistent with MADRS-SI. Overall, 69% of participants had a complete alleviation of SI following repeated infusions. In TRD, single and repeated ketamine infusions resulted in decreases in SI which were maintained with once-weekly maintenance infusions. This study adds to the growing body of research suggesting ketamine as a possible novel treatment strategy for SI in mood disorders.","3"
