DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00572.x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14678064/", "secondary_title": "Addiction"}

A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (\u03b2=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (\u03b2=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (\u03b2=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.", "doi": "10.2196/25973", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34319246/", "secondary_title": "J Med Internet Res"}

II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate \"nonblind,\" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. \"Loss of control,\" associated with a brief, but overwhelming \"rush,\" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans.

However, how such feedback and feedforward connections are modulated in the state induced by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is poorly understood. In this study, an auditory oddball paradigm was presented to healthy participants (16 males, 4 female) under LSD and placebo, and brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Scalp level Event Related Fields (ERF) revealed reduced neural adaptation to familiar stimuli, and a blunted neural 'surprise' response to novel stimuli in the LSD condition. Dynamic causal modelling revealed that both the presentation of novel stimuli and LSD modulate backward extrinsic connectivity within a task-activated fronto-temporal network, as well as intrinsic connectivity in the primary auditory cortex. These findings show consistencies with those of previous studies of schizophrenia and ketamine but also studies of reduced consciousness - suggesting that rather than being a marker of conscious level per se, backward connectivity may index modulations of perceptual learning common to a variety of altered states of consciousness, perhaps united by a shared altered sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Since recent evidence suggests that the psychedelic state may correspond to a heightened 'level' of consciousness with respect to the normal waking state, our data warrant a re-examination of the top-down hypotheses of conscious level and suggest that several altered states may feature this specific biophysical effector.

The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, but much remains unknown about its mechanism of action. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to investigate how ketamine impacts brain activity during cognitive and emotional processing. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 33 unmedicated participants with MDD and 26 healthy controls (HCs) examined how ketamine affected fMRI activation during an attentional bias dot probe task with emotional face stimuli across multiple time points. A whole brain analysis was conducted to find regions with differential activation associated with group, drug session, or dot probe task-specific factors (emotional valence and congruency of stimuli). RESULTS: A drug session by group interaction was observed in several brain regions, such that ketamine had opposite effects on brain activation in MDD versus HC participants. Additionally, there was a similar finding related to emotional valence (a drug session by group by emotion interaction) in a large cluster in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a pattern of brain activity in MDD participants following ketamine infusion that is similar to activity observed in HCs after placebo. This suggests that ketamine may act as an antidepressant by normalizing brain function during emotionally valenced attentional processing.

The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice).

(3) Results: Out of a total of 125,550 respondents, 8.4% reported using hallucinogens. Overall, the trend of hallucinogen use decreased from 13.3% (2001) to 7.0% (2019) (pTrend < 0.0001). Hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad and hopeless (aOR: 1.40; 95%CI: 1.21\u20131.61; p < 0.0001), considering suicide (aOR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.08\u20131.70; p = 0.009), and planning suicide (aOR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.19\u20131.86; p = 0.001). Additionally, adolescent hallucinogen users had a higher prevalence of alcohol, cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, synthetic marijuana, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy use. (4) Conclusions: The overall trend of hallucinogen use decreased among school-going American adolescents. We found a high prevalence of co-occurring substance use among hallucinogen users. We found that hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad, hopeless, and considering and planning suicide. Further research is needed to explore the effects of recreational hallucinogen use among the adolescent population.", "doi": "10.3390/children9121906", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36553349/", "secondary_title": "Children"}

However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 \u00b1 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 \u00b1 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (\u2265 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2017.06.043", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28666206/", "secondary_title": "J Affect Disord"}

OBJECTIVE: New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non-medical use. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30\u00a0mg/70\u00a0kg), DXM (400\u00a0mg/70\u00a0kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength. Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin: liking, visual effects, positive mood, insight, positive social effects, increased awareness of beauty (both visual and music), awe/amazement, meaningfulness, and mystical experience. For most ratings, (1) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo; (2) psilocybin showed dose-related increases; 3, DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin; (4) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM. These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects (alternatively described as the \"motivation\" to use).

The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.", "doi": "10.1055/s-2005-916185", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16342002/", "secondary_title": "Pharmacopsychiatry"}

However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5\u00a0mg/kg and 0.2\u00a0mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi\u2010structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within\u2010subject, double\u2010blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18\u201035 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in\u2010lab sessions separated by 72 hours.

Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs.

In controlled, outpatient research settings, ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts as early as 2\u201024 hours after a single infusion in patients with high suicide risk (Price 2014) ( Murrough 2015). In this IRB approved pilot study, we investigated ketamine\u2019s effects on suicidality in a real\u2010world sample of recent suicide attempters at imminent risk of suicide on a tertiary\u2010care Consultation\u2010Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Through administration of a \u201cpre\u2010treatment\u201d prior to psychiatric hospital transfer, we hypothesized ketamine would rapidly impact suicidal ideation in patients who attempted suicide and synergistically confer enduring benefits to behavioral therapies. Methods: In an open\u2010label design, we recruited 16 transdiagnostic patients,18\u201065 years old to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting, after CL consultation and informed consent. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post\u2010infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures [Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, hopelessness (via Cognitive Triad Inventory)] were compared to 24\u2010hours, 5\u2010days, 12\u2010days, and 1\u2010 and 3\u2010months post\u2010infusion using paired t\u2010tests. Results: Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p\u2019s<.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d\u2019s: 1.7\u20108.8) at acute timepoints (24\u2010hour; 5\u2010day). These large gains were also uniformly maintained during follow\u2010up, continuously out to 3\u2010months post\u2010infusion. Discussion: Ketamine rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra\u2010high\u2010risk, heterogeneous, \u201creal world\u201d sample. Combined with standard care, ketamine might also synergistically enhance the durability of benefit observed following discharge, consistent with a growing literature examining ketamine as a pre\u2010treatment to behavioral therapies ( Dakwar 2020). In forthcoming analyses, we will compare 6\u2010 and 12\u2010month rates of suicide re\u2010attempt and re\u2010hospitalization in ketamine\u2010treated patients to a matched case\u2010control sample of suicide attempters who did not receive ketamine pre\u2010treatment. Conclusion/Implications: Ketamine infusion is a safe, feasible, and viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among patients admitted to the medical hospital after suicide attempt, and could also have enduring benefits. By advancing knowledge of novel treatment methods in real\u2010world clinical services through completion of further studies, ketamine could become an important and novel tool in the treatment of high\u2010risk CL patients.

S-ketamine given intravenously during surgery can help prevent PPD. However, whether S-ketamine in patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) can reduce the incidence of PPD is unknown. This study assessed the effect of S-ketamine as an adjuvant in PCIA for preventing PPD in women undergoing cesarean delivery. METHODS: A total of 375 parturients scheduled to undergo cesarean section and then receive PCIA were recruited from a single center and were randomly assigned to control (C) group (sufentanil 2\u2009\u03bcg/kg\u2009+\u2009tropisetron 10\u2009mg) or S-ketamine (S) group (S-ketamine 0.5\u2009mg/kg\u2009+\u2009sufentanil 2\u2009\u03bcg/kg\u2009+\u2009tropisetron 10\u2009mg). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPD measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) after surgery. The secondary outcomes were EPDS scores, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) scores, and the rate of adverse events, including headache, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and vomit. RESULTS: A total of 275 puerperal women were included in the study. The rate of depression in parturient on postoperative days 3, 14, 28 in the C group and S group were 17.6 and 8.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.05), 24.2 and 9.8% (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 19.0 and 17.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.76) respectively. EPDS scores in the C group and S group on postoperative days 3,14, and 28 were 7.65\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 and 6.00\u2009\u00b1\u20092.47 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), 7.62\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 and 6.38\u2009\u00b1\u20092.67 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 7.35\u2009\u00b1\u20093.17 and 6.90\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78 (p\u2009=\u20090.15), respectively. The rate of adverse events in the C group and S group were headache 3.3 and 4.1% (p\u2009=\u20090.755), nausea 5.9 and 8.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.481), dizziness 9.2 and 12.3% (p\u2009=\u20090.434), drowsiness 6.5 and 10.7%(p\u2009=\u20090.274), and vomit 5.9 and 5.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.585).

There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3\u20104\u2010 day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double\u2010blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 \u03bcg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 \u03bcg LSD (N = 19), or 26 \u03bcg LSD(N = 19) during four 5\u2010hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3\u20104 days.

Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant\u2010like and LSD\u2010like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug\u2010free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition.

While, these effects were similar across psychedelic classes and the dissociative ketamine, LSD was most potent. Additional experiments with DMT also showed these morphological changes, even after the administration of low DMT doses that are considered to be sub\u2010hallucinogenic. The latter is important in light of the increased scientific interest in using low psychedelic doses, also known as 'microdosing'. Despite preclinical evidence for psychedelic\u2010induced neuroplasticity, confirmation in humans is grossly lacking. Given the interest in brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a key player in several neurodegenerative andneuropsychiatric disorders, and the preclinical data showing psychedelics\u2010induced neuroplasticity, even in low doses of psychedelics, the present, double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled, within\u2010subjects study aimed to investigate whether LSD in low doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 mcg) affects BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were recreational psychedelic users (N=24, both sexes) who provided informed consent, fell within the inclusion criteria, and passed medical screening including standard blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, prior to inclusion. Test days were scheduled with minimally five days in between. LSD (5, 10, and 20 mcg LSD base, dissolved in 96% Vol ethanol) or placebo (1 mL of ethanol) was administered orally in the morning (10:00 AM). Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six\u2010hour period, and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA. Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data. Four trapezoidal areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo. The study adhered to the code of ethics on human experimentation, it was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and Maastricht University, and registered in the Dutch Clinical Trial register (number: NTR7102 https://www.trialregister.nl/). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. Complete within\u2010subjects cases (N(5 mcg)=10; N(10 mcg)= 9; N (20 mcg)=8) entered statistical analyses. Non\u2010parametric Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank (S\u2010R) tests for related samples (placebo versus LSD dose) were conducted on BDNF AUC's, and on BDNF plasma levels at \u20100.5h, +2h, +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5, 10 and 20 mcg LSD. Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo. In case of a main effect Dunn's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h, 4h, and 6h, 2h\u20104h, and 4h\u20106h were conducted. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05. The alpha level was corrected for multiple comparisons with sequential Bonferroni in case of Dunn's tests. Results: Wilcoxon Signed\u2010Rank (S\u2010R) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 (Z= \u20102.60, p= 0.009, r= 0.58, 95% CI [0.11\u20101.06]) and 20 mcg LSD (Z= \u20102.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09\u20101.17]) compared to placebo; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant (Z= \u20101.01, p=0.31). Wilcoxon S\u2010R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 (Z= \u20102.80, p< 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.15\u20101.11]) and 10 mcg LSD (Z= \u20101.95, p= 0.05, r= 0.46, 95% [\u20100.04\u20100.97]) compared to placebo. The latter CI included zero, indicating non\u2010significance. Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 (Z= \u20102.29, p= 0.02, = 0.51, 95% CI [0.03\u20100.99]) and 20 mcg (Z= \u20102.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09\u20101.17]) LSD compared to placebo. Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame. BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD (8.95 ng/mL), and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg (8.28 ng/mL) and 20 mcg of LSD (11 49 ng/mL). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration, suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations. This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca (containing the psychedelic DMT) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose, compared to placebo, which was related to fast antidepressant actions. Besides emphasizing the need to sample BDNF beyond the elimination stage, in addition to including behavioral and/or imaging measures, future studies could focus on similarities between underlying biological pathways of the well\u2010studied ketamine, and LSD, as it will contribute to understanding the scope of effects LSD, might have, based on ketamine findings.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-020-00892-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279936/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

However, uncertainty remains in several areas: dose response, consistency across patient groups, effects on suicidality, and possible biases arising from crossover trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized trials in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases up to August 2014. The primary endpoints were change in depression scale scores at days 1, 3 and 7, remission, response, suicidality, safety, and tolerability. Data were independently abstracted by 2 reviewers. Where possible, unpublished data were obtained on treatment effects in the first period of crossover trials. RESULTS: Nine trials were identified, including 201 patients (52% female, mean age 46 years). Six trials assessed low-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and 3 tested very low-dose ketamine (one trial assessed 50 mg intra-nasal spray, another assessed 0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v., and another assessed 0.1-0.5 mg/kg i.v., intramuscular, or s.c.). At day 3, the reduction in depression severity score was less marked in the very low-dose trials (P homogeneity <.05) and among bipolar patients. In analyses excluding the second period of crossover trials, response rates at day 7 were increased with ketamine (relative risk 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.1, P=.001), as were remission rates (relative risk 2.6, CI 1.2-5.7, P=.02). The absolute benefits were large, with day 7 remission rates of 24% vs 6% (P=.02). Seven trials provided unpublished data on suicidality item scores, which were reduced on days 1 and 3 (both P<.01) but not day 7. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine appears more effective than very low dose. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical response, with remission among one-fifth of patients at 1 week but most others having benefits that are less durable. Larger, longer term parallel group trials are needed to determine if efficacy can be extended and to further assess safety.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyv124", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578082/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Pre and post guideline, all patients were treated in a symptom-triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital. Postguideline, standard symptom-triggered dosing continued as preguideline, plus, the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15-0.3\u2009mg/kg/hr continuously until delirium resolved. Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation, a ketamine bolus (0.3\u2009mg/kg) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included (29 preguideline; 34 postguideline). Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated (odds ratio, 0.14; p < 0.01; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days (95% CI, -5.58 to -0.089; p = 0.043). For ICU days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for alcohol level and total benzodiazepine dosing. For hospital days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for patient age, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase level.

Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6\u2009days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4\u2009weeks of follow-up.

However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n\u2009=\u200925) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyad006", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36789509/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300).

We hypothesized that the proportion of individuals with positive urine drug test results presenting at the psychiatric emergency department during the study period would be 20% to 30%. Methods: An unselected cohort of 2,019 adult patients who visited the emergency department of Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center, a university-affiliated government facility, was evaluated and underwent routine urine drug testing between April 2012 and February 2014. Clinical, demographic, and urine drug test data were collected from medical records and statistically analyzed, comparing diagnostic evaluation at admission and after discharge from either the emergency department or the hospital. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify the possible variables associated with drug use in this sample. Results: Urine drug test results showed that 194 of the 2,019 subjects (9.6%) had used a psychoactive substance before attending the emergency department. Among patients with positive urine drug test results, the majority (77.8%) used cannabis, 25.8% used opiates, 24.7% used ecstasy, and 5.2% used cocaine.

Both univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that younger age (18\u201340), male sex, fewer years of education, single marital status, and ICD-10 diagnosis of substance-related, personality, and nonpsychotic disorders were indicators of higher likelihood of positive urine drug test findings. Conclusions: Results suggest that routine urine toxicology screening is not necessary in the psychiatric emergency department as an adjunct to a thorough psychiatric clinical examination.

Methods: Secondary analysis of randomized, double\u2010blind placebo controlled trial of treatment\u2010resistant unipolar depression (18\u201065, MADRS\u226522) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and randomized to double\u2010blind treatment with riluzole (100\u2010200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. Results: Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine (p=.02). In subjects randomized to placebo, the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response (p=.002). There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole (p=.88).

Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism (p=.04). Past personal history had no main effect (p=.057). Conclusions: Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history.

All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump. Randomization will be performed in blocks, ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine. Crossing between the blocks will be performed, so that all patients receive both interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned into two distinct groups through a list of random numbers, keeping allocation concealment preserved. Regarding masking, the same investigator responsible for the allocation will prepare the drugs. Study solutions will be provided in identical 50mL syringes containing midazolam or escetamine with the additional volume of saline solution for a total of 50mL. Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline, making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection. The active placebo used, midazolam, is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms, that is, it does not worsen and does not treat. It is a short\u2010acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action, a short elimination half\u2010life, and a similar time course of dissociative and non\u2010specific behavioral effects (eg, sedation, disorientation) to escetamine, thus providing adequate blinding ( Shiroma, 2020). Such medication is widely used in clinical trials (Peyrovian, 2020; Dakwar, 2020; Rothberg, 2020), with data in the literature proving the safety of its use in OCD patients (Bloch 2012, Rodriguez 2017).

It is expected to find a significant reduction, i.e. greater than or equal to 35% in the total score on the Yale\u2010Brown Obsessive\u2010Compulsive Scale. A mixed linear fixed effects model will be used to examine the differences between esketamine and midazolam treatment. A composite symmetry covariance structure appears to be the best fit to the data. The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data. Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests. Significance is assessed at P < 0.05, two\u2010tailed. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To assess changes from baseline scores for 24h, 7, and 14 days after each infusion in the placebo and control groups on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity and Improvement and the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the change in the Yale\u2010Brown Obsessive\u2010Compulsive Scale total score before each infusion to 7 and 14 days after the procedure between the placebo group and the control group.

Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities. Within the range of observation, co-administration did not affect the changes in mood or recall.

It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged \u226565 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for \u22653 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.", "doi": "10.1213/ane.0000000000005875", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051953/", "secondary_title": "Anesth Analg"}

Employing a combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and quantification of ayahuasca's compounds and their metabolites in the systemic circulation we found ayahua-sca to induce a biphasic effect in the brain.

A number of studies have reported that ecstasy users differ from controls on a variety of measures of cognitive function. However, the literature is not consistent and many negative findings were also reported. One reason for such inconsistency might be interindividual variance in vulnerability to the deleterious effects of ecstasy due to a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that carriers of the s allele at the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which was associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission relative to the l allele, would be most vulnerable to the effects of ecstasy on cognitive function. Methods: We assessed memory, decision-making, and executive function in ecstasy users and controls, stratifying by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR. Results: We observed that the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups differed on a number of measures in both the ecstasy users and the controls. While performing a risky decision-making task, ss and ls controls attended to differences in the probability of winning chosen gambles to a greater extent than the ll controls. However, this difference was dramatically attenuated in the ss ecstasy users. Furthermore, independent of ecstasy use, volunteers of the ss genotype outperformed the ll genotype on a visual planning task.

The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-na\u00efve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O].

Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention.

Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for major abdominal surgery and is shown to have superior analgesia when compared to systemic analgesia[i]. However, its use is controversial[ii]. Lidocaine and ketamine both are being used for perioperative analgesia. Perioperative lidocaine infusion has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption[iii]. Perioperative low dose Ketamine has shown improved postoperative pain and reduced opioid usage[iv]. , therefore,re tested the hypothesis that the combination would provide better analgesia in the milieu of intrathecal morphine. Methods: After institutional ethics approval and written informed consent, we randomized 124 adult ASA 1\u20104 patients scheduled for open liver resection to one of four groups. Intraoperatively, group L received lidocaine infusion, group K received ketamine infusion, group LK received lidocaine and ketamine infusion and group P received saline infusion. All patients received 300 mics intrathecal morphine prior to induction of standardized anesthesia and all infusions were started immediately after the intubation and continued until the end of surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received hydromorphone via a PCA device and its consumption recorded for 3 days. Data regarding other side effects was also recorded. Primary outcome measurements included pain scores and opioid consumption at 24 hrs. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and opioid consumption at 48 and 72 hrs and side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headaches and signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Data analysis included 113 patients. There was no difference in pain scores within all 4 groups at rest or movement at 24 hrs. Mean 48 hrs rest pain scores were 3.1, 1.7, 2.3 and 1.7 in L, K, KL and P groups respectively (p<0.03 between groups, unadjusted for multiple testing procedures). Pain scores were not significantly different at all other time points. All opioids were converted to morphine equivalents. Opioid use was less in ketamine group at 48 hrs but did not reach statistical significance. The total 72 hr use was not significantly different across the groups. There was no difference in side effects between the groups at any time points. Conclusions: In this triple blind, parallel group four\u2010arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trial, lidocaine, ketamine or their combination did not add any benefit over single dose intrathecal morphine with patient controlled hydromorphone analgesia.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus from inception to August 2021 was conducted. Where applicable, the studies were categorized into low and high stages of resistance, where low category included studies where the mean number of failed antidepressants was <3 or had a higher proportion of subjects with \u22642 antidepressant trials.

RESULTS: In total, 18 RCTs were included in the current review. There was variability across reported indicators of disease severity, definition of treatment resistance, as well as treatment protocols, preventing clear direct and indirect comparison of relative efficacy of ketamine at different stages of treatment resistance. Ketamine was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in RCTs at both lower and higher stages of treatment resistance; however, the effect size and duration of effects was greater in RCTs of lower stage of treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that ketamine has antidepressant efficacy across all identified stages of treatment resistance, however with increasing failed treatment trials, treatment might be less efficacious.

This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of six ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods: Ninety seven patients with unipolar (n = 77) and bipolar (n = 20) depression received repeated ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) with continuous vital sign monitoring.

Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2\u00a0weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4\u00a0weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or 'self-disclosure' contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.", "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.623985", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33995022/", "secondary_title": "Front Pharmacol"}

However, it is not known how MDMA interacts with components of the therapeutic process to produce its beneficial effects. We tested the effects of MDMA on four measures of social experience to elucidate the behavioral components that underlie the efficacy of MDMA in combination with psychotherapy. Methods: Healthy volunteers participated in two double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled studies using a within\u2010subjects crossover design. In Study 1 (N=36), they received MDMA (0.75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. In Study 2 (N=18 of 36), they received MDMA (125mg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. During peak drug effect, they completed standardized tasks assessing social behavior. These tasks included a social attention bias task, an emotional response to social feedback task, an affective touch task, and a verbal task assessing synchrony of vocal pitch during a social interaction. Results: MDMA (1.5mg/kg) increased attention to faces expressing positive emotions compared to neutral faces (p<0.05). During the social feedback task, MDMA dose\u2010dependently increased feelings of social acceptance following all types of social feedback (p<0.05), and similarly increased pleasantness ratings of affective touch (p<0.05). Methamphetamine did not produce these effects. Conclusions: These findings build on previous reports that MDMA reduces responses to negative social stimuli by showing that the drug also enhances responses to positive social stimuli. The facilitatory effects of MDMA on social acceptance, affective touch, and attention to positive emotions may improve the patient\u2010therapist connection. Further studies are needed to extend these findings to clinical populations.

AIMS: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. METHODS: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24\u2009hours later, and 2\u2009hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48\u2009hours after extinction training. Participants (N\u2009=\u200934; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100\u2009mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20097.29, p\u2009=\u20090.007).

Animal models suggest a pronounced effect on ventral 'limbic' FST systems, although recent work in patients with psychosis and high-risk individuals suggests specific alterations of dorsal 'associative' FST circuits. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on measures of functional connectivity as indexed by the temporal coherence of spontaneous neural activity in both dorsal and ventral FST circuits, as well as their symptom correlates. We adopted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures design in which 19 healthy participants received either an intravenous saline infusion or a racemic mixture of ketamine (100 ng/ml) separated by at least I week Compared with placebo, ketamine increased functional connectivity between the dorsal caudate and both the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. Ketamine additionally increased functional connectivity of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Both connectivity increases significantly correlated with the psychosis-like and dissociative symptoms under ketamine. Importantly, dorsal caudate connectivity with the ventrolateral thalamus and subthalamic nucleus showed inverse correlation with ketamine-induced symptomatology, pointing to a possible resilience role to disturbances in FST circuits. Although consistent with the role of FST in mediating psychosis, these findings contrast with previous research in clinical samples by suggesting that acute NMDAR antagonism may lead to psychosis-like experiences via a mechanism that is distinct from that implicated in frank psychotic illness.

Loss of Meaning (LoM), a component of demoralization, can be elevated by a cancer diagnosis and predicts DHD and SI in this population. We completed a randomized controlled trial in which psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) produced rapid and sustained improvements in depression, demoralization, and hopelessness in people with cancer. Converging epidemiologic and clinical trial findings suggests a potential antisuicidal effect of this treatment. To probe our hypothesis that PAP relieves SI through its beneficial impacts on depression and demoralization (LoM in particular), we performed secondary analyses assessing within- and between-group differences with regard to LoM and an SI composite score. Among participants with elevated SI at baseline, PAP was associated with within-group reductions in SI that were apparent as early as 8 h and persisted for 6.5 months postdosing. PAP also produced large reductions in LoM from baseline that were apparent 2 weeks after treatment and remained significant and robust at the 6.5 month and 3.2 and 4.5 year follow-ups. Exploratory analyses support our hypothesis and suggest that PAP may be an effective antisuicidal intervention following a cancer diagnosis due to its positive impact on hopelessness and demoralization and its effects on meaning-making in particular.

It is unknown to what extent this mechanism is also responsible for the physiological side-effects of MDMA seen in humans.

In addition, MDMA is a potent releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. \u00a92011 American Medical Association.

It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-66698-001[/rid]). Ketamine is an effective intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), including late-in-life (LL-TRD). The proposed mechanism of antidepressant effects of ketamine is a glutamatergic surge, which can be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma oscillations. Yet, non-linear EEG biomarkers of ketamine effects such as neural complexity are needed to capture broader systemic effects, represent the level of organization of synaptic communication, and elucidate mechanisms of action for treatment responders. In a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial, we investigated two EEG neural complexity markers (Lempel-Ziv complexity [LZC] and multiscale entropy [MSE]) of rapid (baseline to 240 min) and post-rapid ketamine (24 h and 7 days) effects after one 40-min infusion of IV ketamine or midazolam (active control) in 33 military veterans with LL-TRD. We also studied the relationship between complexity and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score change at 7 days post-infusion. We found that LZC and MSE both increased 30 min post-infusion, with effects not localized to a single timescale for MSE. Post-rapid effects of reduced complexity with ketamine were observed for MSE. No relationship was observed between complexity and reduction in depressive symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that a single sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion has time-varying effects on system-wide contributions to the evoked glutamatergic surge in LL-TRD. Further, changes to complexity were observable outside the time-window previously shown for effects on gamma oscillations. These preliminary results have clinical implications in providing a functional marker of ketamine that is non-linear, amplitude-independent, and represents larger dynamic properties, providing strong advantages over linear measures in highlighting ketamine\u2019s effects.

New studies have recommended combination therapy to reduce the side effects of ketamine. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of adding intravenous (IV) lidocaine to ketamine on hemodynamic parameters, endoscopist satisfaction, and recovery time of children undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: This triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in Isfahan, Iran (2021). One hundred twenty children between the ages of 1 and 6 were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The intervention group received 1.0 mg/kg of IV lidocaine and 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine, and the placebo group received 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine and placebo 2 minutes before entering the endoscopic room. Patients in both groups were sedated with 1.0 mg/kg of propofol, 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam, and 2.0 ug/kg of fentanyl for the procedure.

Existing treatment efficacy is moderate, and relapse rates are high. Preliminary findings suggest that psilocybin, a psychedelic compound, can safely and reliably occasion highly meaningful experiences that may spur a positive change in drinking behaviour when administered in a therapeutic context. However, the efficacy of a single psilocybin administration and its potential neurobiological underpinnings still remain unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To establish efficacy, we will investigate the effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy versus placebo in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial. Ninety treatment-seeking patients, aged 20-70 years, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder will be recruited from the community via advertisement and referrals from general practitioners or specialised treatment units. The psilocybin or placebo will be administered in accordance with a protocol for psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postdosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow-up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes are as follows: (1) total alcohol consumption, (2) phosphatidyl-ethanol, an objective biomarker for alcohol, (3) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range, (4) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome and (5) neuronal response to alcohol cues and cognitive flexibility within corticostriatal pathways by use of functional MR brain imaging 1-week postdosing.

To this end, we investigated the patterns of use and the subjectively perceived acute and persisting effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline, among Danish adults. METHODS: An anonymous online survey with 152 items was conducted using the secure survey web application REDCap. Results were presented descriptively and as comparisons between psychedelic drugs. RESULTS: Five-hundred participants (30.0% female, mean age 34.5\u00a0years) were included. Classic psychedelics were mostly used with therapeutic (28.0%) or spiritual (27.2%) intentions. Sixty-seven per cent used classic psychedelics once a year or less. Most participants (56.4%) preferred using psilocybin. Classic psychedelic use was for some individuals, associated with hazardous use of alcohol (39.4%). Among participants with a psychiatric treatment history, 80.9% reported subjective improvements in symptoms following classic psychedelic use.

Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users.

Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin\u2019s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1\u201385 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects.

This occurs shortly after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit. Women who agree to participate will give written, informed consent at this time. Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with intravenous (IV) access, aspiration prophylaxis and intraoperative monitoring. Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic medications will be used as per usual practice after delivery. The anesthesiologist will perform a spinal anesthetic per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3\u20104 interspace (\u00b1 one vertebral interspace). The spinal anesthetic will consist of 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 \u03bcg fentanyl + 150 \u03bcg of morphine. The subject will be placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression. Cesarean section will commence after adequate anesthesia is assured to a T4 sensory level to pinprick. Vasopressors and IV fluids will be administered at the anesthesiologist's discretion per usual practice. At the time of delivery, subjects will be randomized to one of two groups using a computer generated random number table. Randomization will be blocked based on whether the cesarean procedure is a primary or a repeat procedure. Randomization assignments will be kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened by a research nurse who will prepare a 20 mL syringe labeled \"study drug\". The syringe will be given to the anesthesiologist blinded to the treatment group who will subsequently administer the study drug. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive ketamine 10 mg (ketamine 10 mg/mL) diluted to 20 mL with 0.9% preservative free saline. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive 20 mL preservative free saline. The study drug will be administered into the intravenous line via an infusion pump over 10 minutes. Five minutes after placebo or drug administration, the anesthesiologist will ask the subject if she has nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Nausea and pruritus will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe; and vomiting as present or absent. Any spontaneous complaints of psychedelic effects will be noted at this time. Sedation will be assessed via the Richmond agitation\u2010sedation scale (RASS [see Appendix 1]). Upon completion of the cesarean section, the subject will be transported to the post anesthesia recovery unit.

At 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and at 24 h after administration of the study drug, the subject's pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale for pain NRS 0\u201010 (see Appendix 2). Patients may request rescue analgesia if they are experiencing discomfort. The time of first rescue analgesia request will be noted, and the NRS will be determined at the time of request for rescue analgesia. Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per os. An additional dose of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg will be provided after 1 hour if the pain is not relieved to the subject's satisfaction. These are routine oral analgesic medications for postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia. Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and respiratory rate, and treatment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression). The total amount of rescue medication will be determined for each subject after 24, 48 and 72 hours.

These questions will be administered verbally by the anesthesiologist or researcher blinded to the treatment group upon admission to the PACU and at 4 h. The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and secondary outcome data: maternal age, height, weight, prepregnancy weight, gestational age and IV fluids administered during cesarean section. In addition, all intraoperative and postoperative medications will be recorded, including those administered for the treatment of side effects listed above. Protocol specific analgesia assessment ends 24 hours after administration of the study drug. At 72 hours the subject will be asked about her satisfaction with postoperative analgesia (100 mm scale, 0 mm = not satisfied at all, 100 mm = very satisfied).

We investigated the status of brain 5-HT neurons in MDMA users. METHODS: We enrolled 14 previous users of MDMA who were currently abstaining from use and 15 controls who had never used MDMA. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand carbon-11-labelled McN-5652, which selectively labels the 5-HT transporter. We analysed whether there were differences in 5-HT transporter binding between abstinent MDMA users and participants in the control group. Blood and urine samples were taken and tested to check for abstinence. FINDINGS: MDMA users showed decreased global and regional brain 5-HT transporter binding compared with controls.

Several medications are effective for treating depression; however, they take weeks or months to achieve their full effects. A more rapidly acting antidepressant would have a significant impact on the treatment of depression. In a previous study, ketamine produced a rapid antidepressant effect within hours, but the effect lasted less than 1 week. Understanding how ketamine works may lead to a better understanding of the causes of depression and the design of a longer lasting rapidly acting antidepressant. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who are currently experiencing an episode of major depression of at least 4 weeks duration and have not responded to two treatment trials may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures: Medication tapering: Patients who are taking medications for depression are tapered off the drugs over a 1\u2010 to 2\u2010week period. Ketamine/placebo trial: Patients are given a single dose of either ketamine or placebo (an inactive substance), administered intravenously (through a vein) over 40 minutes. After 7 days, patients are given another dose of study drug in crossover fashion; that is, those who previously took ketamine are switched to receive placebo, and those who took placebo are switched to ketamine. Oximetry (measurement of blood oxygen), pulse, and blood pressure are measured continuously for 1 hour before and 4 hours after each ketamine or placebo dose to monitor safety. Interviews and rating scales: Patients complete a series of psychiatric rating scales to assess the effects of the study drug on mood and thinking. The rating scales are repeated up to 18 times during the study, with each time taking about 15 to 20 minutes. Physical examination and laboratory tests: Patients have a physical examination, blood tests, weight measure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) at the beginning and end of the study. They will also have multi\u2010modal MRI, MEG, polysomnography and serum marker studies. The primary endpoint will be the change in clinical ratings of depression.

Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit. RESULTS: Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d\u2009=\u20094.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score \u226410). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

Despite this risk, the consistency and magnitude of symptoms induced by ketamine or what factors are associated with these symptoms remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the psychopathological outcomes associated with ketamine in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia and the experimental factors associated with these outcomes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO databases were searched for within-participant, placebo-controlled studies reporting symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in response to an acute ketamine challenge in healthy participants or patients with schizophrenia. STUDY SELECTION: Of 8464 citations retrieved, 36 studies involving healthy participants were included. Inclusion criteria were studies (1) including healthy participants; (2) reporting symptoms occurring in response to acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (racemic ketamine, s-ketamine, r-ketamine) intravenously; (3) containing a placebo condition with a within-subject, crossover design; (4) measuring total positive or negative symptoms using BPRS or PANSS; and (5) providing data allowing the estimation of the mean difference and deviation between the ketamine and placebo condition. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores were extracted. Subgroup analyses were conducted examining the effects of blinding status, ketamine preparation, infusion method, and time between ketamine and placebo conditions. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used as effect sizes for individual studies. Standardized mean differences between ketamine and placebo conditions were calculated for total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores. RESULTS: The overall sample included 725 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [3.6] years; 533 [73.6%] male) exposed to the ketamine and placebo conditions. Racemic ketamine or S-ketamine was associated with a statistically significant increase in transient psychopathology in healthy participants for total (SMD\u2009=\u20091.50 [95% CI,\u20091.23-1.77]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), positive (SMD\u2009=\u20091.55 [95% CI,\u20091.29-1.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and negative (SMD\u2009=\u20091.16 [95% CI,\u20090.96-1.35]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) symptom ratings relative to the placebo condition. The effect size for this association was significantly greater for positive than negative symptoms of psychosis (estimate, 0.36 [95% CI,\u20090.12-0.61]; P\u2009=\u2009.004). There was significant inconsistency in outcomes between studies (I2\u2009range,\u200977%-83%). Bolus followed by constant infusion increased ketamine's association with positive symptoms relative to infusion alone (effect size, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.90] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.35-1.33]; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Single-day study design increased ketamine's ability to generate total symptoms (effect size, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.69-2.89] vs 1.39 [95% CI, 1.12-1.66]; P\u2009=\u2009.007), but age and sex did not moderate outcomes. Insufficient studies were available for meta-analysis of studies in schizophrenia. Of these studies, 2 found a statistically significant increase in symptoms with ketamine administration in total and positive symptoms. Only 1 study found an increase in negative symptom severity with ketamine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that acute ketamine administration was associated with schizophrenia-like or psychotomimetic symptoms with large effect sizes, but there was a greater increase in positive than negative symptoms and when a bolus was used. These findings suggest that bolus doses should be avoided in the therapeutic use of ketamine to minimize the risk of inducing transient positive (psychotic) symptoms.", "doi": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4693", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32437573/", "secondary_title": "JAMA Netw Open"}

This modified double-blind study investigated the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, in patients with OCD. METHOD: Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub-hallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 microg/kg), medium (200 microg/kg), and high (300 microg/kg) doses were assigned in that order, and a very low dose (25 microg/kg) was inserted randomly and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose. Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion. The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004. RESULTS: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions (23%-100% decrease in YBOCS score). Repeated-measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda (F = 9.86, df = 3,3; p = .046), but no significant effect of dose (F = 2.25, df = 3,3; p = .261) or interaction of time and dose (F = 0.923, df = 9,45; p = .515). Improvement generally lasted past the 24-hour timepoint.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-36851-001[/rid].) Background: Psychedelics induce intense modifications in the sensorium, the sense of 'self,' and the experience of reality. Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular level mechanisms of these drugs, knowledge of their actions on global brain dynamics is still incomplete. Recent imaging studies have found changes in functional coupling between frontal and parietal brain structures, suggesting a modification in information flow between brain regions during acute effects. Methods: Here we assessed the psychedelic-induced changes in directionality of information flow during the acute effects of a psychedelic in humans. We measured modifications in connectivity of brain oscillations using transfer entropy, a nonlinear measure of directed functional connectivity based on information theory. Ten healthy male volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics participated in 2 experimental sessions. They received a placebo or a dose of ayahuasca, a psychedelic preparation containing the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Results: The analysis showed significant changes in the coupling of brain oscillations between anterior and posterior recording sites. Transfer entropy analysis showed that frontal sources decreased their influence over central, parietal, and occipital sites. Conversely, sources in posterior locations increased their influence over signals measured at anterior locations. Exploratory correlations found that anterior-to-posterior transfer entropy decreases were correlated with the intensity of subjective effects, while the imbalance between anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior transfer entropy correlated with the degree of incapacitation experienced. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychedelics induce a temporary disruption of neural hierarchies by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain.

Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores \"thinking disorder\" and \"withdrawal/retardation\" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further.", "doi": "10.1007/s002130050620", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9683005/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

We developed data-driven subgroups of SI trajectories after ketamine administration, then evaluated clinical, demographic, and neurobiological factors that might predict SI response to ketamine. METHODS: Data were pooled from five clinical ketamine trials. Treatment-resistant inpatients (n\u202f=\u202f128) with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression received one subanesthetic (0.5\u202fmg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40\u00a0min. Composite SI variable scores were analyzed using growth mixture modeling to generate SI response classes, and class membership predictors were evaluated using multinomial logistic regressions. Putative predictors included demographic variables and various peripheral plasma markers. RESULTS: The best-fitting growth mixture model comprised three classes: Non-Responders (29%), Responders (44%), and Remitters (27%). For Responders and Remitters, maximal improvements were achieved by Day 1. Improvements in SI occurred independently of improvements in a composite Depressed Mood variable for Responders, and partially independently for Remitters. Indicators of chronic SI and self-injury were associated with belonging to the Non-Responder group. Higher levels of baseline plasma interleukin-5 (IL-5) were linked to Remitters rather than Responders. LIMITATIONS: Subjects were not selected for active suicidal thoughts; findings only extend to Day 3; and plasma, rather than CSF, markers were used.

How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern. Conclusion: Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients. Cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment.

OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20098) or inactive placebo (0\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20094) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1\u00a0month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d\u2009=\u20091.4, CI -\u20090.074, 2.874).

Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy.

No specific treatments exist for those preoccupations that interfere with recovery and trigger relapse. A case study using a ketogenic diet followed by ketamine infusions led to sustained remission in one patient with chronic AN. Here we conducted an open-label trial to test whether this response could be replicated. METHODS: Five adults weight recovered from AN but with persistent eating disorder thoughts and behaviors adopted a therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) aimed at maintaining weight. After sustaining nutritional ketosis, participants received six ketamine infusions and were followed over 6\u00a0months. RESULTS: All participants completed the study protocol without significant adverse effects. Two participants maintained TKD for 8\u00a0weeks prior to ketamine infusions due to good behavioral response and remained on TKD. Three participants received TKD for 4\u00a0weeks prior to and during ketamine, then tapered off after the final infusion.

Given the anatomical proximity, disruptions of the hypothalamic\u2010pituitary axis causing an AVP\u2010D could also disturb the oxytocin (OXT) system. OXT regulates socio\u2010emotional functioning, including fear reduction, attachment, emotion recognition, and empathy. Therefore, these psychological symptoms may be caused by an additional OXT deficiency. However, OXT deficiency has not been established as a pituitary entity, as no provocation test for OXT is currently available. Here, we aimed to investigate the OXT system stimulator 3,4\u2010Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') as a novel biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to reveal an OXT deficiency in patients with cDI. Methods: Randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over study in 15 patients with cDI and 15 matched healthy controls. Participants underwent a psychological baseline evaluation, including the assessment of anxiety levels using the State\u2010Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), mood using the Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), and alexithymia using the Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS). Participants were randomized to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo first. OXT samples were collected at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 minutes after drug intake. Subjective effects in response to MDMA were assessed throughout the experiment. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma OXT concentration curve (AUC) after MDMA intake. Results: Already at baseline, patients compared with healthy controls, showed significantly higher scores in anxiety (STAI: 41 points [IQR 34\u201048] vs. 28 points [24\u201031]; p=0.02), alexithymia (TAS: 47 points [38\u201059] vs. 30 points [29\u201037; p=0.04), and depression symptoms (BDI: 6 points [3\u201017] vs. 1 point [0\u20102]; p=0.04). In response to MDMA stimulation, in patients, there was only a minimal OXT change with 66 pg/ml [16\u201094], while in healthy controls, OXT increased by 658 pg/ml [355\u2010914]. The AUC was 15.8 times (1485%), i.e., 85,678 pg/ml (95%\u2010CI [\u201010,800 to \u201063,356], p<0.001), lower in patients compared with healthy controls. This lack of OXT in patients was associated with lower subjective effects such as 'good drug effect,' 'feeling high,' 'satisfaction,' 'happy,' 'trust,' 'talkative,' 'openness,' and 'fear reduction' compared with healthy controls. Conclusion: These results lay the groundwork for OXT deficiency as a hypothalamic\u2010pituitary entity. In patients with cDI, this lack in OXT was associated with reduced pro\u2010social, empathic, and anxiolytic effects.", "doi": "10.1210/jendso/bvad114.1307", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38596261/", "secondary_title": "Journal of the Endocrine Society"}

Unlike traditional drugs, it yields immediate effects, most likely via increased glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity. However, ketamine administration in humans is systemic and its long-term impact on blood parameters has not yet been described in clinical studies. Here we investigated potential sustained effects of ketamine administration (0.5\u202fmg/kg ketamine racemate) on hematological and biochemical values in plasma and serum in a randomized double-blinded study. 80 healthy young participants were included and whole blood samples were collected 5 days before, and 14 days after the infusion. To assess the group effect, repeated measure analyses of co-variance (rmANCOVA) were conducted for the following blood parameters: levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin and number of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes. RmANCOVA revealed a significant time by treatment effect on thrombocyte levels (F(1, 74) = 13.54, p < 0.001, eta = 0.155), driven by an increase in the ketamine group (paired t-test, t = -3.51, df = 38, p = 0.001).

It also explores the potential for ayahuasca as an adjunctive ED treatment. METHODS: Thirteen individuals previously diagnosed with an ED participated in a semi-structured interview contrasting their experiences with conventional ED treatment with experiences from ceremonial ayahuasca. The interviews were analyzed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participant reports were organized with key themes including that ayahuasca: led to rapid reductions in ED thoughts and symptoms; allowed for the healing of the perceived root of the ED; helped to process painful feelings and memories; supported the internalization of greater self-love and self-acceptance; and catalyzed spiritual elements of healing.

ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR PARTICIPANTS: Aged 18 or older with current suicidal ideation, admitted to hospital voluntarily. Exclusion criteria included a history of schizophrenia or other psychotic disorders, substance dependence, and contraindications for ketamine. PARTICIPANTS: 156 participants were recruited and randomised to placebo (n=83) or ketamine (n=73), stratified by centre and diagnosis: bipolar, depressive, or other disorders. INTERVENTION: Two 40 minute intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) were administered at baseline and 24 hours, in addition to usual treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The primary outcome was the rate of patients in full suicidal remission at day 3, according to the scale for suicidal ideation total score \u22643. Analyses were conducted on an intention-to-treat basis. RESULTS: More participants receiving ketamine reached full remission of suicidal ideas at day 3 than those receiving placebo: 46 (63.0%) of 83 participants in the ketamine arm and 25 (31.6%) of 73 in the placebo arm (odds ratio 3.7 (95% confidence interval 1.9 to 7.3), P<0.001). This effect differed according to the diagnosis (treatment: P<0.001; interaction: P=0.02): bipolar (odds ratio 14.1 (95% confidence interval 3.0 to 92.2), P<0.001), depressive (1.3 (0.3 to 5.2), P=0.6), or other disorders (3.7 (0.9 to 17.3, P=0.07)). Side effects were limited. No manic or psychotic symptom was seen. Moreover, a mediating effect of mental pain was found. At week 6, remission in the ketamine arm remained high, although non-significantly versus placebo (69.5% v 56.3%; odds ratio 0.8 (95% confidence interval 0.3 to 2.5), P=0.7). CONCLUSIONS: The findings indicate that ketamine is rapid, safe in the short term, and has persistent benefits for acute care in suicidal patients. Comorbid mental disorders appear to be important moderators. An analgesic effect on mental pain might explain the anti-suicidal effects of ketamine.

Furthermore, the benefits of mindfulness are well documented. However, no systematic reviews have examined linkage of mindfulness and psychedelics use. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the link between psychedelics and characteristics of mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, inclusive of grey literature and backwards/forward-citation tracking, on the 18 January 2021. The search strategy included terms relating to mindfulness and psychedelics, with no restriction on clinical or non-clinical conditions. Study quality was assessed. An exploratory random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on pre-post mindfulness data relative to psychedelic ingestion. Results: Of 1805 studies screened, 13 were included in the systematic review. There was substantial variability in participant characteristics, psychedelic administration method and measurement of mindfulness. The ingestion of psychedelics is associated with an increase in mindfulness, specifically relating to domains of acceptance, which encompasses non-judgement of inner experience and non-reactivity. The meta-analysis of a subset of studies (N = 6) showed small effects overall relative to ayahuasca ingestion, increasing mindfulness facets of non-judgement of inner experience and non-reactivity, as well as acting with awareness.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to assay motor task performance-associated brain activation changes in MDMA and non-MDMA users. 24 subjects (14 MDMA users and 10 controls) performed an event-related motor tapping task (1, 2 or 4 taps) during fMRI at 3 T. Motor regions of interest were used to measure percent signal change (PSC) and percent activated voxels (PAV) in bilateral motor cortex, sensory cortex, supplementary motor area (SMA), caudate, putamen, pallidum and thalamus. We used SPM5 to measure brain activation via three methods: T-maps, PSC and PAV. There was no statistically significant difference in reaction time between the two groups. For the Tap 4 condition, MDMA users had more activation than controls in the right SMA for T-score (p = 0.02), PSC (p = 0.04) and PAV (p = 0.03). Lifetime episodes of MDMA use were positively correlated with PSC for the Tap 4 condition on the right for putamen and pallidum; with PAV in the right motor and sensory cortex and bilateral thalamus. In conclusion, we found a group difference in the right SMA and positive dose-response association between lifetime exposure to MDMA and signal magnitude and extent in several brain regions. This evidence is consistent with MDMA-induced alterations in basal ganglia-thalamocortical circuit neurophysiology and is potentially secondary to neurotoxic effects on 5-HT signaling.

The objective of this study was to indirectly assess aggression in current and abstinent ecstasy users using an information-processing paradigm that measures cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content. The task employed has previously shown increased aggressive bias 3-4 days after ecstasy use. An interpretative bias task was administered to 105 male participants: 26 ex-ecstasy users, 25 current ecstasy users, 29 polydrug using controls, and 25 drug-naive controls. Accuracy and response times to process and recognize ambiguous sentences were tested. There were no group differences in aggressive interpretative bias. All 4 groups processed neutral sentences faster than aggressive sentences and were subsequently faster and more confident in recognizing neutral compared with aggressive sentences. Further, self-ratings of aggression also showed no group differences, even though self-rated impulsivity was significantly higher in current ecstasy users than in drug-naive controls. The findings that all groups were biased toward neutral and away from aggressive interpretations of ambiguous sentences add to the existing body of knowledge in suggesting that increased aggression found in ecstasy users a few days after taking the drug is a transient phenomenon and not a long-term, persisting effect. \u00a9 2007 American Psychological Association.", "doi": "10.1037/1064-1297.15.4.351", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17696682/", "secondary_title": "Experimental and Clinical Psychopharmacology"}

It measures three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet its factorial structure has never been tested by structural equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced ASC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study conducted a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST suggested that the \"oceanic boundlessness\" and \"visionary restructuralization\" factors could be combined on a high level of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities, discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well among the three drug groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug induced ASC.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0012412", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20824211/", "secondary_title": "PLoS One"}

Evidence indicates that the main psychoactive ingredient in ecstasy (methylendioxymethamphetamine) causes long-term changes to the serotonin system in human users. Previous research has found that amphetamine-abstinent ecstasy users have disrupted visual processing in the occipital lobe which relies on serotonin, with researchers concluding that ecstasy broadens orientation tuning bandwidths. However, other processes may have accounted for these results. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present research was to determine if amphetamine-abstinent ecstasy users have changes in occipital lobe functioning, as revealed by two studies: a masking study that directly measured the width of orientation tuning bandwidths and a contour integration task that measured the strength of long-range connections in the visual cortex of drug users compared to controls. METHOD: Participants were compared on the width of orientation tuning bandwidths (26 controls, 12 ecstasy users, 10 ecstasy + amphetamine users) and the strength of long-range connections (38 controls, 15 ecstasy user, 12 ecstasy + amphetamine users) in the occipital lobe. RESULTS: Amphetamine-abstinent ecstasy users had significantly broader orientation tuning bandwidths than controls and significantly lower contour detection thresholds (CDTs), indicating worse performance on the task, than both controls and ecstasy + amphetamine users. CONCLUSION: These results extend on previous research, which is consistent with the proposal that ecstasy may damage the serotonin system, resulting in behavioral changes on tests of visual perception processes which are thought to reflect serotonergic functions in the occipital lobe.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-013-3094-9", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23609769/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

Week 1: Baseline Intake Appointment. Those who are eligible to participate on the basis of the telephone screen and provide informed consent will then complete a standard demographic questionnaire, a detailed psychiatric interview, and provide a urine sample for confirmation of substance abstinence and pregnancy status. Participants will then be administered a detailed medical history interview and physical examination including EKG and blood panel. Week 2: Orientation. Participants who are medically eligible to participate will be scheduled for a psychoeducational orientation session that further explains the rationale of the study, and summarizes the study logistics. Participants will complete a number of baseline questionnaires and neuropsychological assessments at this time. Week 3: Drug administration #1. In a between\u00e2\u20ac\u0090groups design, participants will be randomized to receive 0 mg, 1 mg, 2.5 mg, or 5 mg of psilocybin at five weekly 6\u00e2\u20ac\u0090hour long drug administration sessions. Dose will remain constant for each participant at each drug administration session. At Drug Administration #1 and all subsequent drug administration sessions, participants will complete visual analogue scale (VAS) questions drawn from different sources that include drug abuse liability measures. These VAS questions will be administered at drug administration baseline and every 30 minutes thereafter through the end of acute effects at 6\u00e2\u20ac\u0090hrs post\u00e2\u20ac\u0090baseline.

At peak drug effects (2 hr post\u00e2\u20ac\u0090baseline), a number of measures will be administered, each differing by drug administration session. At Drug Administration #1, participants will undergo two electroencephalogram (EEG) tasks (with assessments at baseline serving as pre\u00e2\u20ac\u0090drug control values). At 6\u00e2\u20ac\u0090hr post\u00e2\u20ac\u0090baseline, participants will complete self\u00e2\u20ac\u0090report measures assessing the subjective experience. These questionnaires will be administered at the conclusion of each drug administration session. Participants will then be administered a brief semi\u00e2\u20ac\u0090structured qualitative interview designed to probe the nature of their experience. All participants will be required to arrange for transportation home from the CRU; participants will not be allowed to drive themselves after drug administration sessions. Week 4: Drug Administration #2. This session will be identical to Drug Administration #1, however, at peak drug effects, participants will complete two new EEG tasks (with assessments at baseline serving as pre\u00e2\u20ac\u0090drug control values). Week 5: Drug Administration #3. This session will be identical to prior drug administration sessions, however, at peak drug effects, a neuropsychological measure will be administered.

However, knowledge about the epidemiology of classic psychedelics in the Nordic countries is limited. METHODS: We recruited adult, Norwegian participants who have had a memorable experience after taking a classic psychedelic substance. They filled in an anonymous internet survey with 119 items covering matters related to recreational use of psychedelics using a secure, web-based application. Data are presented by using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations). RESULTS: We recruited 841 participants, 770 (72% male; 88% 45\u2009years or younger) of which were included in the data analysis. The intentions behind taking the psychedelic substance were mainly recreational (46.1%) or therapeutic (42.3%). Most participants reported that their most memorable experience was with psilocybin. As in modern era clinical trials, most participants were well-prepared before, did processing during, and did integration work after the experience, whereas only a minority were supported by a therapist. Self-perceived symptoms of various mental disorders and substance use disorders were prevalent in the sample. Most subjects reported improvements in their condition. Although adverse reactions were usually mild and short-lived, 4.2% lasted for 1\u2009year or more. Persisting flashbacks were present for a year or more among 2.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional sample of Norwegian, self-selecting adults, we shed light on what characterizes the most memorable experience with a classic psychedelic substance, including short- and long-term risks and benefits. For the most part, the psychedelic experience led to improvements in self-perceived symptoms of mental disorders and substance use disorders.

Results: Being female, older at the time of first 5-MeO-DMT dose, having higher educational attainment, and dosing in a structured group setting were associated with increased odds of reporting a reactivation event. Higher mystical experience scores, greater personal wellbeing and having had a non-dual awareness experience that was not substance-induced were associated with higher likelihood of reporting a neutral or positive emotional valence of a reactivation event.

The authors sought to determine the efficacy of adjunctive intranasal esketamine in major depressive disorder (MDD). DATA SOURCES: A systematic search of PubMed/MEDLINE was conducted up to January 2019, in addition to abstracts of major psychiatric meetings held since 2010. Searches were conducted by cross-referencing the term intranasal with the term esketamine. Where necessary, authors and/or study sponsors were contacted in order to obtain a copy of the presentation as well as any pertinent study details. STUDY SELECTION: 241 study abstracts were initially identified and reviewed. Selected studies were randomized, double-blind clinical trials comparing adjunctive intranasal esketamine to adjunctive placebo for MDD. DATA EXTRACTION: Data were extracted independently by two of the authors. A random effects model was used to calculate the standardized mean difference (SMD) between esketamine and placebo (intranasal saline) in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score change from baseline to endpoint, serving as the primary outcome of the study.

This study directly compared psychedelic occasioned and non-drug experiences which altered individuals' beliefs about death. Individuals who reported an experience that altered their beliefs about death occasioned by either a psychedelic drug or a near-death or other non-ordinary experience completed an online survey. Circumstances of the experience, mystical and near-death subjective features, changes in attitudes about death, and other persisting effects were evaluated. The study sample (n = 3192) included five groups: non-drug near-death or other non-ordinary experiences (n = 933), and drug experiences occasioned by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (n = 904), psilocybin (n = 766), ayahuasca (n = 282), or N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) (n = 307). Analyses of differences in experiences were adjusted statistically for demographic differences between groups. Compared to the psychedelic groups, the non-drug group was more likely to report being unconscious, clinically dead, and that their life was in imminent danger. The groups were remarkably similar in the reported changes in death attitudes attributed to the experience, including a reduced fear of death and high ratings of positive persisting effects and personal meaning, spiritual significance, and psychological insight. Although both psychedelic and non-drug participants showed robust increases on standardized measures of mystical and near-death experiences, these measures were significantly greater in the psychedelic participants. Non-drug participants were more likely to rate their experiences as the single most meaningful of their lives. Comparing across psychedelic substances, ayahuasca and DMT groups tended report stronger and more positive enduring consequences of the experience than the psilocybin and LSD groups, which were largely indistinguishable.

Three self-rating questionnaires were completed when drug-free: the SCL-90 (an outpatient psychiatric symptom checklist), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy (IVE) scale; and the uplifts, hassles, stresses and cognitive failures questionnaire. Heavy Ecstasy users reported significantly higher scores than controls on the following SCL-90 factors: paranoid ideation, psychoticism, somatisation, obsessionality, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, altered appetite and restless sleep, together with greater IVE impulsiveness. Light ecstasy users generally produced intermediate scores, with significantly higher scores than controls on two factors and significantly lower scores than heavy ecstasy users on another two. Previous reports have described various psychiatric and psychobiological disorders in recreational ecstasy users, but it is not known how typical they are, being mainly based on individual case studies. This is the first study to describe psychological problems in a non clinical sample of young recreational ecstasy users. However, our ecstasy users were polydrug users, with both groups showing significantly greater usage of amphetamine, LSD and cocaine, than the controls. These other illicit drugs probably contributed to their adverse psychobiological profiles, while there is also the possibility of pre-existing differences between ecstasy users and non users.

Few human studies have examined salvinorin A. OBJECTIVE: This double-blind, placebo-controlled study evaluated the dose-related effects of inhaled salvinorin A in individuals with histories of hallucinogen use. METHODS: Eight healthy hallucinogen-using adults inhaled up to 16 doses of salvinorin A (0.375-21\u00a0\u03bcg/kg) in ascending order. Physiological, behavioral, and subjective effects were assessed every 2\u00a0min for 60\u00a0min after administration. Qualitative subjective effects were assessed retrospectively via questionnaires at the end of sessions. Persisting effects were assessed 1\u00a0month later. RESULTS: Orderly dose-related effects peaked at 2\u00a0min and then rapidly dissipated, replicating previous findings. Subjective effects were intense, with maximal drug strength ratings or unresponsiveness frequently observed at high doses. Questionnaires assessing qualitative effects (Hallucinogen Rating Scale, Pharmacological Class Questionnaire) suggested some overlap with serotonergically mediated classic hallucinogens. Salvinorin A also produced dose-related dissociative effects and impairments in recall/recognition memory. At 1-month follow-up, there was no evidence of persisting adverse effects. Participants reported that salvinorin A effects were qualitatively different from other drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Salvinorin A produces a unique profile of subjective and cognitive effects, including strong dissociative effects and memory impairment, which only partially overlap with classic hallucinogen effects.

OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this article is to study the effects of ketamine on extrastriatal dopamine receptor availability in healthy subjects and extracellular dopamine levels in rat cortex. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The effect of computer-driven subanesthetic ketamine infusion on cortical dopamine release was studied in healthy male subjects using a controlled study design. Dopamine D2/D3 receptor availability was quantified using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]FLB 457. A conventional region of interest-based analysis and voxel-based analysis was applied to the PET data. The ketamine-induced cortical dopamine release in rats was studied using in vivo microdialysis. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion reduced significantly the [11C]FLB 457 binding potential (BP) in the posterior cingulate/retrosplenial cortices, suggestive of increased dopamine release. This brain imaging finding was further supported by a microdialysis experiment in rats showing that ketamine increased the extracellular dopamine concentration by up to 200% in the retrosplenial cortex. Ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms were associated with changes in the [11C]FLB 457 BP in the dorsolateral prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that cortical dopaminergic mechanisms have a role in the emergence of ketamine-induced psychosis-like symptoms in man.

RESULTS: Early improvement post-infusion 1 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-3.52, 95% BCa CI [-5.40, -1.78]) and 2 (\u03b2\u00a0=\u00a0-3.16, 95% BCa CI [-5.75, -1.59]) both significantly predicted QIDS-SR(16) scores post-infusion 4. Early improvers had significantly lower QIDS-SR(16) scores at post-infusion 4 (post-infusion 1 improvers: M\u00a0=\u00a09.8, SD\u00a0=\u00a04.5; post-infusion 2 improvers: M\u00a0=\u00a010.6, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.7) compared to non-early improvers (post-infusion 1 non-improvers: M\u00a0=\u00a013.7, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.8; post-infusion 2 non-improvers: M\u00a0=\u00a014.1, SD\u00a0=\u00a05.3) when controlling for baseline characteristics. The majority (58%) of individuals who did not improve post-infusions 1 or 2 still experienced an antidepressant response or partial response (\u226520% reduction in QIDS-SR(16)) post-infusion 4. LIMITATIONS: This is a post-hoc analysis of an open-label study. CONCLUSION: Early improvement was associated with greater antidepressant effects following a course of four ketamine infusions.

METHODS: 6 women and 4 men between 23 and 38 years were investigated twice in a randomized double blind cross-over design receiving injections of 2 mg/kg BW racemic ketamine or 1 mg/kg BW S(+)-ketamine at an interval of at least 7 days. Samples were taken from a central venous catheter before and 1, 3, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60 and 120 min after injection for analysis of adrenaline, noradrenaline (by high pressure liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection), ADH, ACTH, cortisol (by radio immuno assay), glucose, lactate and free glycerol. In addition, SAP, HR, and arterial oxygen saturation were measured, and return of consciousness and orientation were protocoled. Incidence and assessment of dreams were reported by the volunteers. RESULTS: Adrenaline, noradrenaline, ACTH, cortisol, lactate and free glycerol in plasma as well as SAP and HR increased significantly after injection of both racemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine. The influence on ADH and glucose was not significant. There were no differences between racemic ketamine and S(+)-ketamine in these parameters. Recovery was significantly improved after administration of S(+)-ketamine. Simple orders were followed after 7.9 +/- 1.1 vs. 9.2 +/- 1.2 min (P = 0.004).

On each day, participants rated the trustworthiness of 66 faces, carried out three co-operative behaviour tasks (public good; dictator; ultimatum game) and completed mood self-ratings. RESULTS: Acute ecstasy use was associated with increased face trustworthiness ratings and increased cooperative behaviour on the dictator and ultimatum games; on day 3 there were no group differences on any task. Self-ratings showed the standard acute ecstasy effects (euphoria, energy, jaw clenching) with negative effects (less empathy, compassion, more distrust, hostility) emerging on day 3.

Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in treating cancer-related anxiety and depression. A double-blind controlled trial was performed, where 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned to treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin in conjunction with psychotherapy. Previously published results of this trial demonstrated that, in conjunction with psychotherapy, moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust, and enduring anxiolytic, and anti-depressant effects. Here, we illustrate unique clinical courses described by four participants using quantitative measures of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin, anxiety, depression, quality of life, and spiritual well-being, as well as qualitative interviews, written narratives, and clinician notes. Although the content of each psilocybin-assisted experience was unique to each participant, several thematic similarities and differences across the various sessions stood out. These four participants' personal narratives extended beyond the cancer diagnosis itself, frequently revolving around themes of self-compassion and love, acceptance of death, and memories of past trauma, though the specific details or narrative content differ substantially.

Background: Terminally ill patients may experience existential distress, depression, or anxiety, limiting quality of life in the final stage. Existing psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions have (time) limited efficacy. Psychedelic treatment may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option. Aim: Systematically review studies on psychedelic treatment with and without psychotherapy for existential distress, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill patients. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for original-data studies on the treatment of depression, anxiety, and existential distress with classical or a-typical psychedelics in patients with a terminal illness, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: A total of 1850 records were screened, and 33 articles were included in this review: 14 studies on classical psychedelics (DPT, LSD, and psilocybin) and 19 studies on atypical psychedelics (MDMA and ketamine). Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Both classical and a-typical psychedelics are promising treatment options in patients with terminal illness. To draw final conclusions on effectiveness and safety of psychedelics, we need larger high-quality studies for classical psychedelics and MDMA. Ketamine studies should pay more attention to existential dimensions of well-being and the psychotherapeutic context of the treatment.

This knowledge is mostly informed by animal models, while translational mechanistic studies in humans are scarce. For example, a study in a stress model indicated that stress reduced apical dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 neurons, while ketamine normalized spine numbers within one hour [2]. In addition, previous evidence indicated that ketamine's synaptic turnover changes are brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dependent [3]. In this study, we aimed to detail the impact of ketamine on CA1 and other hippocampal subfields and investigate the influence of BDNF genotype status in healthy human subjects. The study was conducted as post\u2010hoc analysis of a previously conducted trial. Methods: Thirty\u2010one healthy volunteers (14 female, mean age 25.2) underwent a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled crossover MRI study. Each subject was measured twice with a structural T1\u2010weighted structural MRI on a Siemens 3T Trio Scanner applying MPRAGE sequences (TR/TE=2300/4.21 ms, flip angle set to 9\u00b0, voxel size 1.0\u00d71.0\u00d71.1 mm). In the scanner after the baseline sequence, esketamine (0.11 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.12mg/kg was infused over 20 minutes. The second structural MRI scan was recorded within the same session 45 minutes afterwards. Each subject underwent a placebo scan in randomized crossover order at least a week apart. We used FreeSurfer 6.0 for automated hippocampal subfield delineation and genotyping for BDNF Val66Met genotype status (Val/Val n=19 vs. Met\u2010carrier n=12) was conducted with PLEX assay and the MassARRAY. We used linear mixed models (lMM) and differences of least means squares to compare volume differences before and after ketamine and placebo. Additionally, we incorporated BDNF genotype status as fixed effect. Post hoc testing was Tukey\u2010Kramer adjusted. Results: Linear mixed modeling yielded a significant main effect for drug (F1,741=7, p=0.0083). We found no significant subfield surviving Tukey\u2010Kramer correction (all p>0.05). For the left CA1 we found a trend for moderate volume increases after ketamine vs. placebo (p=0.076, t30=1.84, cohen's d=0.39). Within this sample, there was no main effect for genotype status on hippocampal subfield volume differences between ketamine and placebo (F1,742=0.18, p=0.67). Discussion: We conducted a forward translational psychiatric neuroscience study and demonstrated a significant effect of ketamine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volumes in humans. In accordance with previous results in animals, we found a trend for increased CA1 volumes within 45 min after ketamine infusion, that speak for immediate effects on neuronal plasticity of ketamine. The main limitation of this work is the low ketamine dose as well as lack of stress before the MRI experiment in healthy subjects. In addition, we did not substantiate an effect of BDNF genotype status on hippocampal volume changes.

PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but these treatments do not help everyone. 3,4\u2010methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)\u2010assisted psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD. This is a Phase 2 randomized, dose comparison, double\u2010blind study to assess safety and efficacy of manualized MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy in treating chronic, treatment\u2010resistant PTSD. Seven subjects will be randomized to receive full dose MDMA (full dose condition) and five subjects will receive a comparator (comparator condition), with an optional supplemental half\u2010dose available 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Global Clinician\u2010Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score one month after two sessions of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy is the primary outcome measure. MDMA or comparator will be administered in two blinded experimental sessions lasting up to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart. The will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months of psychotherapy, and a long\u2010term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final experimental session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to assess eligibility for enrollment. Once in the study, they will see the same male and female psychotherapist for the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy and the investigators will learn more about the subject during three preparatory sessions occurring before the first experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will receive an initial dose of either full dose MDMA or placebo along with psychotherapy, and one and a half to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a supplemental half the size of the initial dose. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. There will be three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, including one occurring the day after an experimental session. Subjects will express, understand and connect any of their thoughts or feelings about PTSD symptoms and their causes, and they will discuss their experience during experimental sessions with the therapists. Subjects will learn the dose of MDMA they received one month after the second MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy session. Subjects who received full dose will complete Stage 1, with a third open\u2010label session, and subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will go on to Stage 2, an open label period of the study that is nearly identical to stage 1, but with one instead of three preparatory sessions and one of two active doses of MDMA used in all three experimental sessions. This study will compare the effects of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus full dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, dissociation, general psychological well\u2010being, sleep quality and potential positive effects of experiencing traumatic events will be measured in all subjects at baseline, one month after the second experimental session and 12 months after their final experimental session, and any subjects reporting pain or tinnitus at the start of the study will record these symptoms throughout the study.Subjects who received the full dose and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of PTSD and other symptoms two months after the third experimental session. Subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session and two months after the third experimental session. Measures of cognitive function will be given to subjects in Stage two months after their third experimental session, and to Stage 2 subjects two months after their third Stage 2 session. People will also complete measures of their experience of the experimental session soon after each experimental session. At least 12 months after their final Stage 1 or Stage 2 session, measures of PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, sleep quality, general well\u2010being and and post traumatic growth will be assessed again, and subjects will complete a questionnaire on the benefits and harms of study participation and other life events and views related to study participation.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT01958593"}

Previous studies with the serotonergic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin showed that these drugs reduced the recognition of negative (fear) faces in healthy volunteers. This trial assessed the acute and prolonged effects of a single dose of ayahuasca on the REFE. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy volunteers participated in a pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized trial. Study variables included a REFE task performed before and 4 hours after drug intake, subjective effects (self-reports/observer impressions), tolerability measures (cardiovascular measures, self-reports), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma levels. The REFE task was applied again 1, 7, 14, and 21 days and 3 months after drug intake. Stability of ayahuasca alkaloids during the study was also assessed (room temperature, 18 months). FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, ayahuasca did not modify the REFE. No significant effects were observed on cardiovascular measures and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Volunteers reported visual effects, tranquility/relaxation, and well-being, with few reports of transient anxiety/confusion. Ayahuasca was well tolerated, producing mainly nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and vomiting. A significant time-dependent deterioration of alkaloids was observed, especially for dimethyltryptamine. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of significant effects on the REFE task could be due to lack of effects of ayahuasca (at the doses used), alkaloid degradation, learning effects, and the high educational level of the sample. Further trials with different samples are needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other serotonergic hallucinogens on the REFE.

Disturbances in integrative function have been consistently described in psychotic disorder; for instance, prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (startle-PPI) which is a marker of sensory gating, is deficient in persons with schizophrenia. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produces in control subjects a spectrum of neurobehavioral symptoms like encountered in schizophrenia, and disrupts startle-PPI in animals. In the present study, we investigated in 12 healthy subjects whether ketamine would reduce sensory-gating in auditory responses at doses which produce psychotic symptoms. In a double-blind, crossover design loading doses of 0.024, 0.081 and 0.27 mg/kg or saline were employed, followed by maintenance infusion for 120 min. A passive paradigm has been developed which consisted in tone bursts, preceded or not by a (near-threshold) click at intervals of 100 ms or 500 ms. Brain electromagnetic activity imaging of the responses to sound stimuli has been carried out by way of a 148-channel magnetoencephalography-system. Actual evoked response amplitudes and underlying equivalent current dipole strengths have been compared to multielectrode evoked potentials from the scalp. A click stimulus is capable to inhibit test responses under placebo at the 100ms interval. During maintenance infusion of ketamine at steady-state (for >30 min) after 0.27 mg/kg, no such amplitude changes were observed anymore (p<0.05) and under these circumstances significant increases in Brief Psychiatric Rating scale and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores were evidenced (p<0.001). Intermediate effects have been observed when the dose was lowered to 0.081 mg/kg. The present results have shown that ketamine may induce a psychotic-like clinical state associated with gating deficits in healthy subjects.

Recreational use of MDMA generally includes repeated drug consumption, often in association with other drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis. In the laboratory setting, repeated MDMA administration to healthy MDMA consumers produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction similar to that observed with the ingestion of a single dose, and the first of the two administrations paralleled the time-course of MDMA-induced cortisol stimulation kinetics and MDMA plasma concentrations. A significant decrease in CD4 T-helper cells with simultaneous increase in natural killer (NK) cell and a decrease in functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation was observed. Response to the second dose was either long-lasting compared with the first dose or disproportionate and did not show any parallelism with cortisol and MDMA plasma concentrations. This circumstance extended the critical period during which immunocompetence is highly impaired as a result of MDMA use. Accumulation of MDMA in the body of a poor metabolizer induced higher immunomodulatory effects with statistically significant differences in NK cell function compared with extensive metabolizers. When basal values of lymphocyte subsets were examined in a population of recreational MDMA users participating in different clinical trials, alterations in several immunological parameters were observed. The absolute number of lymphocytes, in particular T lymphocytes and CD4 T-helper cell subsets, showed a trend toward reduced values, although cell counts were within normal limits. By contrast, NK cells in MDMA consumers were reduced to one-third of those from healthy persons. A statistically significant decrease in affected immune parameters was recorded during a 2-year observation period in a subgroup of recreational MDMA users.

Two substances have received heightened attention: 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or\u0303ecstasy\u2122) and ?-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC or \u0303cannabi). Preclinical evidence, as well as human studies examining regular ecstasy consumers, indicated that ecstasy use may have negative effects on learning, verbal memory and complex attentional functions. Cannabis has also been linked to symptoms of inattention and deficits in learning and memory. Most of the published studies in this field of research recruited participants by means of newspaper advertisements or by using word-of-mouth strategies. Because participants were usually aware that their drug use was critical to the research design, this awareness may have caused selection bias or created expectation effects. Focussing on attention and memory, this study aimed to assess cognitive functioning in a community-based representative sample that was derived from a large-scale epidemiological study. Available data concerning drug use history allowed sampling of subjects with varying degrees of lifetime drug experiences. Cognitive functioning was examined in 284 young participants, between 22 and 34?years. In general, their lifetime drug experience was moderate. Participants completed a neuropsychological test battery, including measures for verbal learning, memory and various attentional functions. Linear regression analysis was performed to investigate the relationship between cognitive functioning and lifetime experience of drug use. Ecstasy and cannabis use were significantly related to poorer episodic memory function in a dose-related manner. For attentional measures, decrements of small effect sizes were found. Error measures in tonic and phasic alertness tasks, selective attention task and vigilance showed small but significant effects, suggesting a stronger tendency to experience lapses of attention. No indication for differences in reaction time was found. The results are consistent with decrements of memory and attentional performance described in previous studies. These effects are relatively small; however, it must be kept in mind that this study focussed on assessing young adults with moderate drug use from a population-based study. \u00a9 2009 British Association for Psychopharmacology.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881108091076", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18635709/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology"}

Design Test-re-test study. Participants MDMA users (life-time use >5 times) were recruited in St Louis, Miami and Sydney (n = 593). The median life-time MDMA consumption was 50 pills at the baseline. Measurements The computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drug (CD-SAM) was used to assess MDMA abuse and dependence. The Discrepancy Interview Protocol (DIP) was used to determine the reasons for the discrepant responses between the two interviews. Reliability of diagnoses, individual diagnostic criteria and withdrawal symptoms was examined using the kappa coefficient (\u03ba). Findings For baseline data, 15% and 59% met MDMA abuse and dependence, respectively. Substantial test-re-test reliability of the diagnoses was observed consistently across cities (\u03ba = 0.69). 'Continued use despite knowledge of physical/psychological problems' (87%) and 'withdrawal' (68%) were the two most prevalent dependence criteria. 'Physically hazardous use' was the most prevalent abuse criterion. Six dependence criteria and all abuse criteria were reported reliably across cities (\u03ba: 0.53-0.77). Seventeen of 19 withdrawal symptoms showed consistency in the reliability across cities. The most commonly reported reason for discrepant responses was 'interpretation of question changed'. Only a small proportion of the total discrepancies were attributed to lying or social desirability.

However, the components of the psychotherapy that accompanies MDMA treatment have not been fully investigated. One novel, yet understudied, component of psychedelicassisted psychotherapy is therapeutic touch, raising the possibility that drugs like MDMA affect treatment response in part by affecting the somatosensory experience. The effects of psychoactive drugs on the experience of touch are not fully understood. In controlled studies with healthy volunteers, we tested the effects of three different psychoactive drugs on responses to affective touch; 1) the prosocial drug MDMA, 2) the prototypical stimulant methamphetamine, which shares some properties with MDMA without producing reported experiences of social closeness, and 3) the opioid buprenorphine, which has been shown to enhance some dimensions of social reward processing. Methods: Healthy men and women participated in two doubleblind placebo\u2010controlled studies using a within\u2010subjects crossover design. In Study 1 (N = 36; two sessions), they received buprenorphine (0.2 mg) or placebo in randomized counterbalanced order. In Study 2 (N = 36; four sessions), they received MDMA (0.75 mg/kg and 1.5 mg/kg), methamphetamine (20 mg), and placebo. In both studies, during expected peak drug effect, they completed an affective touch task to assess pleasantness of either affective touch (slow forearm brushing; 3 cm/s) or nonaffective touch (fast forearm brushing; 30 cm/s). Pleasantness of the touch was assessed with facial electromyography (EMG) and subjective ratings. These measures were examined in relation to ratings of subjective drug effects measured by the Drug Effects Questionnaire (DEQ, e.g. liking the drug and wanting more). Results: As expected, slow touch was rated as more pleasant than fast touch in both studies. Both MDMA (both doses) and buprenorphine (0.2 mg) increased pleasantness ratings of affective touch [MDMA: F(2,70)=7.27, p < 0.05; buprenorphine t(34)=\u20101.70, p < 0.05], but methamphetamine did not. For MDMA, increases in pleasantness ratings were significantly correlated with \u201clike drug\u201d (r = 0.39, p < 0.05) and \u201cwant more\u201d (r = 0.50, p < 0.01). Conclusions: The finding that MDMA, and not methamphetamine, enhanced pleasantness ratings of affective touch is consistent with reports that the drug enhances the experience of touch in recreational settings. This finding suggests that changes in somatosensory processing may also contribute to the drug's effectiveness in MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy. Our finding the opioid buprenorphine also enhances pleasantness of affective touch suggests that this effect is not specific to serotonergic stimulant drugs, but may also occur with other drug classes, and may be dissociable from euphorigenic effects.

METHODS: Cardiovascular effects of esketamine nasal spray, combined with an oral antidepressant, were evaluated in 1708 esketamine-treated adults with TRD in six trials (five double-blind, placebo-controlled (486 placebo-treated patients); one open-label) of 4-52\u00a0weeks' duration. Patients with established cardiovascular disease, including uncontrolled hypertension (>\u2009140/>\u200990\u00a0mmHg), history of hypertensive crisis, or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, were excluded from enrollment. Effects on cardiac repolarization were assessed in a phase\u00a0I randomized, positive- and active-controlled thorough corrected QT (QTc) interval study. For adverse events, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] for esketamine/antidepressant versus antidepressant/placebo was calculated. RESULTS: Adverse events related to increased BP were reported in 12.8% of all esketamine-treated patients (in double-blind trials: esketamine/antidepressant 11.6% vs. antidepressant/placebo 3.9%; OR 3.2 [1.9-5.8]). Among the patients without a history of hypertension, new antihypertensive medication was initiated by 2.1% (6/280) of patients in the esketamine/antidepressant group versus 1.2% (2/171) of patients in the antidepressant/placebo group, in the double-blinded studies. Adverse events related to abnormal heart rate were reported in 3.0% of all esketamine-treated patients (in double-blind trials: 1.6% vs. 0.8%; OR 1.9 [0.5-8.6]). Overall, three cardiovascular adverse events related to BP increase were reported as serious and severe, and there was one fatal event considered unrelated (acute cardiac failure). BP increases reached the maximum postdose value within ~\u200940\u00a0min of esketamine dosing and returned to the predose range by ~\u20091.5\u00a0h postdose. In two studies (4-week duration, age 18-64\u00a0years), the largest mean maximum systolic/diastolic postdose BP increases were 13.3/8.7\u00a0mmHg for esketamine/antidepressant and 6.1/4.9\u00a0mmHg for antidepressant/placebo, and in a short-term elderly study (age \u2265\u200965\u00a0years) were 16.0/9.5 and 11.1/6.8\u00a0mmHg, respectively. Across studies/study phases, <\u20092% of patients discontinued esketamine due to adverse events of increased BP and tachycardia. No clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters was observed.

MDMA added to this impairment as indicated by a significant main effect of MDMA on verbal and spatial memory performance. Mood ratings and response speed revealed an MDMA by Time interaction. After administration of MDMA response speed improved and feelings of vigor, friendliness, elation, anxiety, confusion, arousal and positive mood increased in magnitude during the night, while all these parameters returned to placebo-like levels on the final morning session.

Epidemiological studies have linked chronic ketamine use with a number of problems, including cognitive impairments, bladder dysfunction, and ketamine-related death. However, little is known about the long-term effects of ketamine use on brain structure and function. Methods We used voxel based morphometry in conjunction with statistical parametric mapping on the structural magnetic resonance images of ketamine-dependent (n = 41) and drug-naive control individuals (n = 44) to assess differences in gray matter volume between the two groups. Results We observed significant decreases in gray matter volume in bilateral frontal cortex (left superior frontal gyrus and right middle frontal gyrus) of ketamine users in comparison with control subjects (p < .05 corrected for multiple comparisons at cluster-level). Duration of ketamine use was negatively correlated with gray matter volume in bilateral frontal cortex, whereas the estimated total lifetime ketamine consumption was negatively correlated with gray matter volume in left superior frontal gyrus. Conclusions We have demonstrated a reduction in frontal gray matter volume in patients after chronic ketamine use. The link between frontal gray matter attenuation and the duration of ketamine use and cumulative doses of ketamine perhaps suggests a dose-dependent effect of long-term use of the drug. Our results have important connotations for the clinical picture that is likely to emerge with the growing recreational use of ketamine and is also relevant to the status of the drug as a model for schizophrenia. \u00a9 2011 Society of Biological Psychiatry.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2010.08.030", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21035788/", "secondary_title": "Biological Psychiatry"}

{"record_id": 985, "keywords": "", "text": "Adverse effects of ayahuasca: Results from the Global Ayahuasca Survey.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a plant-based decoction native to Amazonia, where it has a long history of use in traditional medicine. Contemporary ritual use of ayahuasca has been expanding throughout the world for mental health purposes, and for spiritual and personal growth. Although researchers have been conducting clinical trials and observational studies reporting medical and psychological benefits, most of these do not report ayahuasca's immediate or medium-term adverse effects, so these are underrepresented in the literature. With the expansion of ayahuasca ceremonies from their traditional contexts to countries around the world, there is an important public health question regarding the risk/benefit balance of its use. METHODS: We used data from an online Global Ayahuasca Survey (n = 10,836) collected between 2017 and 2019 involving participants from more than 50 countries. Principal component analysis was performed to assess group effects. Logistic regression analysis was performed to test for adverse effects associated with history of ayahuasca use, clinical, context of use and spiritual effect variables. RESULTS: Acute physical health adverse effects (primarily vomiting) were reported by 69.9% of the sample, with 2.3% reporting the need for subsequent medical attention. Adverse mental health effects in the weeks or months following consumption were reported by 55.9% of the sample, however, around 88% considered such mental health effects as part of a positive process of growth or integration. Around 12% sought professional support for these effects. Physical adverse effects were related to older age at initial use of ayahuasca, having a physical health condition, higher lifetime and last year ayahuasca use, having a previous substance use disorder diagnosis, and taking ayahuasca in a non-supervised context. Mental health adverse effects were positively associated with anxiety disorders; physical health conditions; and the strength of the acute spiritual experience; and negatively associated with consumption in religious settings. CONCLUSIONS: While there is a high rate of adverse physical effects and challenging psychological effects from using ayahuasca, they are not generally severe, and most ayahuasca ceremony attendees continue to attend ceremonies, suggesting they perceive the benefits as outweighing any adverse effects. Knowing what variables might predict eventual adverse effects may serve in screening of, or providing additional support for, vulnerable subjects. Improved understanding of the ayahuasca risk/benefit balance can also assist policy makers in decisions regarding potential regulation and public health responses.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pgph.0000438", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36962494/", "secondary_title": "PLOS Glob Public Health"}

To better understand its full therapeutic potential, one way is to study the effects on processes like flexible thinking, empathy, and well-being, which are normally compromised in stress-related psychopathologies. Materials and Methods: Volunteers attending ayahuasca ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: baseline, the morning after, and 1\u00a0week after the ceremony. We included the constructs of creative thinking (measured by Picture Concept Test), empathy (Multifaceted Empathy Test), satisfaction with life (Satisfaction with Life Scale), decentering (Experiences Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory) into the test battery. Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire, the Ego Dissolution Scale, and Visual Analogue Scales. Results: In total, 43 attendees (males = 22; females = 21) completed parts of the baseline assessment, 20 (males = 12; females = 8) completed assessments in the morning after the ceremony, and 19 (males = 14; females = 5) completed assessments at the 1-week follow-up. At one and 7\u00a0days post-ceremony, cognitive empathy, satisfaction with life, and decentering increased, while divergent thinking (Fluency corrected for Originality) decreased, when compared to baseline. Implicit emotional empathy increased at 1-week follow-up, whereas ratings of the trait neuroticism decreased. Conclusion: The study suggests that a single ingestion of ayahuasca in a social setting is associated with enhancement of subjective well-being, an enhanced ability to take an objective and non-judging stance towards the self (decentering), and the ability to correctly recognize emotions in others, compared to baseline, lasting up to 1\u00a0week post-ceremony. To understand the therapeutic potential related to these effects, further research with clinical populations is needed in which these effects can be assessed, including its link with therapeutic outcomes.

OBJECTIVE: To report on the safety of laboratory studies with subanesthetic doses of ketamine in healthy humans using an existing dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medically healthy subjects with no personal or familial Axis I psychotic spectrum disorders were administered subanesthetic doses of ketamine by intravenous infusion in a series of clinical investigations from 1989 to 2005. The safety of ketamine administration was monitored in these subjects. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty subjects received at least one dose of active ketamine. Eight hundred and thirty three active ketamine and 621 placebo infusions were administered. Ten adverse mental status events were documented in nine subjects/infusions that were deemed related to ketamine administration (2% of subjects, 1.45% of infusions). All but one adverse reaction resolved by the end of the test session. The side effects in the remaining individual were no longer clinically significant within 4 days of the test session.

Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017-03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies. RESULTS: Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a0-1.17 and d\u00a0=\u00a0-1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d\u00a0= -1.03 and d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal.

However, clinical and animal studies investigating the effects of intravenous ketamine on specific functional domains disrupted by depression reported conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent findings exploring the cognitive effects of ketamine in depression. METHODS: After a bibliographic search on PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo, we retrieved 11 original studies meeting our research criteria, 7 in humans with MDD or Treatment Resistant Disorder and 4 using rats models for depression. RESULTS: Overall the results showed that a) ketamine reduced activation and normalized connectivity measures of several brain regions related to depressive behaviors and reversed deficits in cognitive flexibility and coping response strategy in rats with depressive features, and b) ketamine leads to a no significant impairment on neurocognitive functions in most of the studies, with only three studies observing improvements in speed of processing, verbal learning, sustained attention and response control, verbal and working memory. LIMITATIONS: The methodological heterogeneity, in terms of neuropsychological tests used and cognitive domain explored, of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies included showed no significant cognitive impairments in MDD patients after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, the results of the fMRI studies considered suggest that ketamine may have a normalizing effect on brain functions during attentional and emotional processing in MDD patients.

We aimed to collect prospective data in order to improve our ability to predict acute- and longer-term responses to psychedelics. Individuals who planned to take a psychedelic through their own initiative participated in an online survey (www.psychedelicsurvey.com). Traits and variables relating to set, setting and the acute psychedelic experience were measured at five different time points before and after the experience. Principle component and regression methods were used to analyse the data. Sample sizes for the five time points were N = 654, N = 535, N = 379, N = 315, and N = 212 respectively. Psychological well-being was increased 2 weeks after a psychedelic experience and remained at this level after 4 weeks. Higher ratings of a \"mystical-type experience\" had a positive effect on the change in well-being after a psychedelic experience, whereas the other acute psychedelic experience measures, i.e., \"challenging experience\" and \"visual effects\", did not influence the change in well-being after the psychedelic experience. Having \"clear intentions\" for the experience was conducive to mystical-type experiences. Having a positive \"set\" as well as having the experience with intentions related to \"recreation\" were both found to decrease the likelihood of having a challenging experience. The baseline trait \"absorption\" and higher drug doses promoted all aspects of the acute experience, i.e., mystical-type and challenging experiences, as well as visual effects. When comparing the relative contribution of different types of variables in explaining the variance in the change in well-being, it seemed that baseline trait variables had the strongest effect on the change in well-being after a psychedelic experience. These results confirm the importance of extra-pharmacological factors in determining responses to a psychedelic.

Therefore, our results suggest that monoaminergic substances can induce widespread changes in within-network connectivity in the absence of marked subjective drug effects.

Better treatments for adolescent depression are urgently needed. We have previously shown that ketamine has short\u2010term efficacy compared to midazolam for depressive symptoms (measured via MADRS) in a treatment\u2010resistant population of adolescents. In adults, ketamine also reduces implicit measures of mood disturbance (via implicit association tasks (IATs), and specifically reduces the symptom domain of anhedonia. It is currently unknown whether ketamine has similar effects in the pediatric population. Pediatric metabolism of ketamine at subanesthetic doses has also not been well characterized. Methods: We conducted a randomized, midazolam\u2010controlled crossover trial (n=17) to evaluate the effects of ketamine in treatment\u2010refractory adolescent MDD over four weeks. Adolescents (13\u201017 years old) must have failed at least one adequate trial of a standard antidepressant to enroll. On day 1 and day 14 adolescent received either ketamine (0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (0.045mg/kg over 40 minutes). Subjects stayed on their psychiatric mediations, with stable dosing for the four weeks prior to the trial and the duration of the trial. We have previously reported the primary outcome, MADRS score at 1 day following infusion between midazolam and ketamine; secondary outcomes of the trial included measures of anxiety, anhedonia, and hopelessness. A subset of subjects (n=12) took IATs at baseline and 24 hours post infusion assessing the following 4 constructs: 1) Depression; 2) Suicide/death; 3) Self\u2010harm; 4) Anxiety. D scores from the 24 hours post infusion IATs for both ketamine and midazolam were compared for all 4 IAT measurements. For pharmacokinetic studies, plasma was isolated from all subjects at baseline and four timepoints post\u2010infusion (40 min, 80 min, 110 min, 230 min). Results: For implicit association tasks, ketamine treatment reduced D scores compared to midazolam treatment for the depression IAT (p = 0.053) with an effect size of 0.65. There was also a trend towards a reduced D score for the suicide/death IAT, with an effect size of 0.50. The self\u2010harm and anxiety IAT results did not appear sensitive to ketamine treatment in this small sample. Ketamine reduced explicit anxiety measures relative to midazolam, but there was minimal impact on the Children's Pleasure Scale, a measure of anhedonia. Conclusions: Adolescent treatment\u2010resistant depression is a significant public health problem that is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. The brain undergoes substantial maturation during adolescence, and novel therapeutics must be carefully tested with attention to developmental context.

There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT(2A) receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed.

The exact mechanism of action is unclear but based on studies done in the 60's using serotonergic hallucinogens in patients with advanced cancer, improvements in anxiety levels, mood and pain were reported. However, a treatment model developed by the famous British psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond, offers one possibility. In this model, serotonergic hallucinogens' therapeutic mechanism lies in their ability to allow the individual to access novel dimensions of consciousness and their efficacy or lack thereof relies on whether a transcendent and mystical state of awareness is attained. Another possible mechanism relates to what Dobkin de Rios and Grob have described as 'managed altered states of consciousness,' where the power of suggestibility, occurring in a safe setting, allows one to transcend a particular state of consciousness (i.e. anxiety and depression associated with advanced illness) as a means to facilitate emotional discharge and to manage irreconcilable conflict.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00957359"}

Aim: The aim of the current analysis was to examine potential effects of concomitant treatment with benzodiazepines on the safety and efficacy of esketamine nasal spray following first\u2010dose treatment of patients in urgent need of symptom control. Methods: Post\u2010hoc analyses of pooled data from two randomized double\u2010blind studies of esketamine (ASPIRE\u20101 [NCT03039192], ASPIRE\u20102 [NCT03097133]) [1, 2] were performed. Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD), active suicidal ideation with intent, and need for psychiatric hospitalization were randomized to placebo or esketamine 84mg nasal spray twice\u2010weekly for 4 weeks, each with comprehensive standard\u2010of\u2010care (initial hospitalization and newly\u2010initiated or optimized oral antidepressant[s]). Efficacy and safety were each analyzed in two groups, based on whether or not patients used benzodiazepines. For efficacy assessments, which were performed on day 2 (24 hours post\u2010initial dose), benzodiazepine users included patients who took a benzodiazepine(s) between day \u20102 and day 2. For safety assessments, including Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale and Modified Observer's Assessment of Alertness/Sedation scale, that were assessed up to 1.5 hours post\u2010dose, benzodiazepine users included patients who took a benzodiazepine(s) on day \u20102 and/or day \u20101 (before dosing of study drug began). The protocol prohibited benzodiazepine use within 8 hours prior to and 4 hours post dosing and 8 hours prior to day 2 efficacy assessments. The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to 24 hours post\u2010first dose in Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score \u2013 was analyzed using analysis of covariance (ANCOVA). Results: In the ASPIRE studies, 456 patients were randomized to study drug. Four patients (2 in each treatment group) were excluded from analyses of efficacy and safety because they did not receive a dose of intranasal study drug; 1 additional patient (in the esketamine group) was excluded from analyses of efficacy due to absence of post\u2010baseline MADRS assessments. Most patients (309/451, 68.5%) used concomitant benzodiazepines. Mean MADRS total score decreased from baseline to 24 hours post\u2010first dose in both treatment groups, with greater improvement in depressive symptoms among those treated with esketamine plus standard\u2010of\u2010care as compared to placebo plus standard\u2010of\u2010care. The between\u2010group difference favored esketamine over placebo among patients taking benzodiazepines (difference of least squares, LS, means [95% CI]: \u20104.3 [\u20106.63 to \u20101.89]) and also among patients who did not take benzodiazepines (\u20103.1 [\u20106.62 to 0.45]). For patients in the esketamine plus standard\u2010of\u2010care group, decrease in MADRS total score was numerically but not statistically significantly greater among those not taking benzodiazepines (mean [SD]: \u201016.8 [12.82]) versus those taking benzodiazepines (\u201015.8 [11.27]) (difference of LS means [95% CI], 1.1 [\u20102.24 to 4.45]). Among esketamine\u2010treated patients, the incidence of sedation was numerically higher with benzodiazepine use (8.1% vs. 1.3%), whereas the incidence of dissociation was similar (32.0% vs. 26.6%). Conclusions: The findings from the ASPIRE studies suggest that while efficacy of esketamine is not attenuated or enhanced by use of benzodiazepines, an increased rate of sedation was observed in MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent.

METHODS: To investigate the role of 5-HT2A/1A receptors in visual processing the effect of the hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist psilocybin (125 and 250 \u03bcg/kg vs. placebo) on the spatiotemporal dynamics of modal object completion was assessed in normal volunteers (n = 17) using visual evoked potential recordings in conjunction with topographic-mapping and source analysis. These effects were then considered in relation to the subjective intensity of psilocybin-induced visual hallucinations quantified by psychometric measurement. RESULTS: Psilocybin dose-dependently decreased the N170 and, in contrast, slightly enhanced the P1 component selectively over occipital electrode sites. The decrease of the N170 was most apparent during the processing of incomplete object figures. Moreover, during the time period of the N170, the overall reduction of the activation in the right extrastriate and posterior parietal areas correlated positively with the intensity of visual hallucinations. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest a central role of the 5-HT2A/1A-receptors in the modulation of visual processing.

We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients, while producing minimal adverse events. METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5\u00a0years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3\u00a0mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6\u00a0mg/kg (group K) 30\u00a0min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10\u00a0min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24\u00a0h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P\u2009=\u20090.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P\u2009=\u20090.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P\u2009=\u20090.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P\u2009=\u20090.0152).

Under certain conditions, MDMA can also damage brain dopamine (DA) neurons, at least in rodents. Human MDMA users have been found to have reduced brain 5-HT transporter (SERT) density and cognitive deficits, although it is not known whether these are related. This study sought to determine whether MDMA users who take closely spaced sequential doses, which engender high plasma MDMA concentrations, develop DA transporter (DAT) deficits, in addition to SERT deficits, and whether there is a relationship between transporter binding and cognitive performance. Materials and methods: Sixteen abstinent MDMA users with a history of using sequential MDMA doses (two or more doses over a 3- to 12-h period) and 16 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls participated. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the DAT and SERT radioligands, [11C]WIN 35,428 and [11C]DASB, respectively. Subjects also underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing. Results: MDMA users had reductions in SERT binding in multiple brain regions but no reductions in striatal DAT binding. Memory performance in the aggregate subject population was correlated with SERT binding in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, brain regions implicated in memory function. Prior exposure to MDMA significantly diminished the strength of this relationship. Conclusions: Use of sequential MDMA doses is associated with lasting decreases in brain SERT, but not DAT. Memory performance is associated with SERT binding in brain regions involved in memory function. Prior MDMA exposure appears to disrupt this relationship. These data are the first to directly relate memory performance to brain SERT density. \u00a9 2008 Springer-Verlag.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-008-1218-4", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18661256/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology"}

Ayahuasca induces a modified state of awareness through the combined action of its active principles: the psychedelic N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and a series of centrally acting \u00df-carbolines, mainly harmine and tetrahydroharmine. To better understand the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, here we compared the impact on mindfulness capacities induced by two independent interventions: (a) participation in four ayahuasca sessions without any specific purpose related to improving mindfulness capacities; and (b) participation in a standard mindfulness training course: 8 weeks mindfulness-based stress reduction (MBSR), with the specific goal of improving these skills. Methods: Participants of two independent groups completed two self-report instruments: The Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) and the Experiences Questionnaire (EQ). The MINDSENS Composite Index was also calculated, including those EQ and FFMQ items that have proven to be the most sensitive to meditation practice. Group A (n = 10) was assessed before and after the last of four closely spaced consecutive ayahuasca sessions. Group B (n = 10) was assessed before and after completion of a standard 8-week MBSR course. Results: MBSR training led to greater increases in overall mindfulness scores after the 8-week period. MBSR but not ayahuasca led to increases in the MINDSENS Composite Index. However, the ayahuasca sessions induced comparable increases in the Non-Judging subscale of the FFMQ, specifically measuring \"acceptance.\" Improving this capacity allows for a more detached and less judgmental stance toward potentially distressing thoughts and emotions. Conclusion: The present findings suggest that a small number of ayahuasca sessions can be as effective at improving acceptance as more lengthy and costly interventions.

These receptors further predominantly mediate the subjective and behavioral effects of psilocybin and might be important for its recently suggested antidepressive effects. However, the effect of psilocybin on emotional processing biases and the specific contribution of 5-HT2A receptors across different emotional domains is unknown. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind study, 17 healthy human subjects received on 4 separate days placebo, psilocybin (215 \u03bcg/kg), the preferential 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin (50 mg), or psilocybin plus ketanserin. Mood states were assessed by self-report ratings, and behavioral and event-related potential measurements were used to quantify facial emotional recognition and goal-directed behavior toward emotional cues. RESULTS: Psilocybin enhanced positive mood and attenuated recognition of negative facial expression. Furthermore, psilocybin increased goal-directed behavior toward positive compared with negative cues, facilitated positive but inhibited negative sequential emotional effects, and valence-dependently attenuated the P300 component. Ketanserin alone had no effects but blocked the psilocybin-induced mood enhancement and decreased recognition of negative facial expression. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that psilocybin shifts the emotional bias across various psychological domains and that activation of 5-HT2A receptors is central in mood regulation and emotional face recognition in healthy subjects.

Potential influences of past environments, however, have received little attention. AIMS: To investigate how previous environmental stimuli shaped the experiences of patients receiving ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and develop the concept of \"imprinting\" to account for such time-lagged effects across diverse hallucinogenic drugs. METHODS: Recordings of treatment sessions and phenomenological interviews from 26 participants of a clinical trial investigating serial intravenous ketamine infusions for TRD, conducted from January 2021 to August 2022, were retrospectively reviewed. A broad literature search was undertaken to identify potentially underrecognized examples of imprinting with both serotonergic and atypical psychedelics, as well as analogous cognitive processes and neural mechanisms. RESULTS: In naturalistic single-subject experiments of a 28-year-old female and a 34-year-old male, subjective ketamine experiences were significantly altered by varying exposures to particular forms of digital media in the days preceding treatments. Higher levels of media exposure reduced the mystical/emotional qualities of subsequent psychedelic ketamine experiences, overpowering standard intention-setting practices and altering therapeutic outcomes. Qualitative data from 24 additional patients yielded eight further spontaneous reports of past environmental exposures manifesting as visual hallucinations during ketamine experiences. We identified similar examples of imprinting with diverse psychoactive drugs in past publications, including in the first-ever report of ketamine in human subjects, as well as analogous processes known to underly dreaming. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Past environmental exposures can significantly influence the phenomenology and therapeutic outcomes of psychedelic experiences, yet are underrecognized and understudied.

In contrast, ketamine selectively increased amygdala and orbitofrontal activity during successful encoding of negative stimuli. On the network level ketamine generally increased medial prefrontal-parahippocampal coupling while specifically decreasing amygdala-orbitofrontal interplay during encoding of negative stimuli. On the behavioural level, ketamine produced generally decreased memory performance and abolished the emotional enhancement of memory after a wash-out period of 5 days. The present findings suggest that ketamine produces general as well as valence-specific effects during emotional memory formation. The pattern partly overlaps with alterations previously observed in patients with schizophrenia.

Advances in rodent functional imaging have opened the possibility that this phenotype could serve as a translational imaging marker for psychiatric research. Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies has indicated an increase in PFC-HC coupling during working-memory tasks in both schizophrenic patients and at-risk populations, in contrast to a decrease in resting-state PFC-HC connectivity. Acute ketamine challenge is widely used in both humans and rats as a pharmacological model to study the mechanisms of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction in the context of psychiatric disorders. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to establish whether acute ketamine challenge has consistent effects in rats and humans by investigating resting-state fMRI PFC-HC connectivity and thus to corroborate its potential utility as a translational probe. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy human subjects (12 females, mean age 25\u00a0years) received intravenous doses of either saline (placebo) or ketamine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg body weight). Eighteen Sprague-Dawley male rats received either saline or ketamine (25\u00a0mg/kg). Resting-state fMRI measurements took place after injections, and the data were analyzed for PFC-HC functional connectivity. RESULTS: In both species, ketamine induced a robust increase in PFC-HC coupling, in contrast to findings in chronic schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: This translational comparison demonstrates a cross-species consistency in pharmacological effect and elucidates ketamine-induced alterations in PFC-HC coupling, a phenotype often disrupted in pathological conditions, which may give clue to understanding of psychiatric disorders and their onset, and help in the development of new treatments.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-015-4022-y", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26184011/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

Efficacy and onset of action are currently among the main factors that influence clinical decision making, however, the effect of these treatments on cognitive functions should also be a crucial point, given that cognitive impairment in depression is strongly related to disease burden and functional recovery. ECT is known to induce transient cognitive impairment, while little is known about ketamine's impact on cognition. This study therefore aims to compare ECT and serial ketamine administration not only with regard to their antidepressant efficacy but also to acute neurocognitive effects. METHODS: Fifty patients suffering from depression were treated with either serial ketamine infusions or ECT. Depression severity and cognitive functions were assessed before, during, and after treatment. RESULTS: ECT and ketamine administration were equally effective, however, the antidepressant effects of ketamine occurred faster. Ketamine improved neurocognitive functioning, especially attention and executive functions, whereas ECT was related to a small overall decrease in cognitive performance. CONCLUSIONS: Due to its pro-cognitive effects and faster antidepressant effect, serial ketamine administration might be a more favorable short-term treatment option than ECT.

OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study was to examine the association of lifetime ecstasy use with semantic memory performance and brain activation in ecstasy polydrug users. METHODS: A total of 23 abstinent ecstasy polydrug users (age\u2009=\u200924.57\u00a0years) and 11 controls (age\u2009=\u200922.36\u00a0years) performed a two-part functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) semantic encoding and recognition task. To isolate brain regions activated during each semantic task, we created statistical activation maps in which brain activation was greater for word stimuli than for non-word stimuli (corrected p\u2009<\u20090.05). RESULTS: During the encoding phase, ecstasy polydrug users had greater activation during semantic encoding bilaterally in language processing regions, including Brodmann areas 7, 39, and 40.

Behavioral performance did not differ between groups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ecstasy polydrug users have increased brain activation during semantic processing. This increase in brain activation in the absence of behavioral deficits suggests that ecstasy polydrug users have reduced cortical efficiency during semantic encoding, possibly secondary to MDMA-induced 5-HT neurotoxicity.

MDMA use was associated with impairments of psychological well-being, verbal memory and altered serotonergic functioning in a number of cross-sectional studies. Due to inherent methodological limitations, such as the notorious polydrug use of ecstasy users and lack of control of possible pre-existing differences between ecstasy users and control participants, researchers have called for well-controlled, prospective longitudinal studies to shed more light on the issue of MDMA neurotoxicity to the human brain. This longitudinal study investigated whether mood, cognition and central serotonin transporters (SERT) would deteriorate with continued MDMA use and whether or not they would recover over increasing periods of MDMA abstinence. In a repeated-measures design, 11 current and ten ex-ecstasy users, and 11 polydrug (but not MDMA) and 15 drug-naive controls participated three times within approximately two years. Both ecstasy user groups reported a polydrug use pattern besides heavy ecstasy use. Subjective reports of ecstasy use or abstinence were verified by toxicological analyses. On each trial, the participants underwent a cognitive test battery and filled in the Symptom Check List. The availability of central SERT was assessed with positron emission tomography using the McN5652 ligand for all groups at t1, and only for the ecstasy user groups on follow-ups. The factor Group yielded significant results in the SCL-90 scales Global Severity Index, Anxiety, Obsessive/compulsive and Interpersonal sensitivity, with the ex-ecstasy users reporting the highest symptom scores. There were significant Group effects in all measures of verbal memory, with the lowest performance in the group of ex-ecstasy users. The repeated-measures analyses yielded no significant Group x Time interactions in any SCL-90 scales or measures of memory performance, with the exception of AVLT 1 immediate recall. Thus the ex-ecstasy users' psychopathological symptoms and memory performance failed to improve, and the current ecstasy users' failed to deteriorate, over time relative to the other groups. While there was a significant effect of Group in all brain regions examined (except the control region white matter), the current users' SERT availability seems to have recovered in the mesencephalon, as indicated by a significant Group x Time interaction. Reduced SERT availability might be a transient effect of heavy ecstasy use, since it partially recovered as the current users reduced their MDMA use. However, this measure may not necessarily be a valid indicator of the number or integrity of serotonergic neurons. Ex-ecstasy users' verbal memory showed no sign of improvement even after over 2.5 years of abstinence and thus may represent persistent functional consequences of MDMA neurotoxicity. However, alternative causes such as pre-existing group differences cannot be completely ruled out in spite of the longitudinal design.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881106059486", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510479/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

Fifty patients who were candidate for undergoing ECT entered the study and were divided into two groups namely A and B. The group A received a package containing 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine and 1.5 mg/kg ketamine plus 0.1 mg/kg dexmedetomidine, and the group B received a medicine package containing 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine and 1.5 mg/kg ketamine plus normal saline. The hemodynamic variables and side effects of the two drug classes were evaluated and compared to each other. Results: The durations of spontaneous respiratory recovery from seizure termination, end seizure to complete consciousness and recovery in the group A was significantly lower than the group B (P<0.001). However, the mean of systolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure after the end of seizure was significantly less in the group A than the group B, but the mean of SPO2 in the fifth minute in the group B was significantly lower than the group A. However, the frequency of nausea and muscle pain in the group B was significantly higher than the group A.

Ketamine has been shown to rapidly and robustly decrease symptoms of depression in depressed patients with bipolar disorder. We sought to determine whether baseline anxiety status reduced ketamine's ability to decrease symptoms of depression. METHODS: Thirty-six patients with anxious (n = 21) and non-anxious (n = 15) treatment-resistant bipolar depression (types I and II; concurrently treated with either lithium or valproate) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 min.

CONCLUSIONS: Both anxious and non-anxious patients with bipolar depression had significant antidepressant responses to ketamine, although the anxious depressed group did not show a clear antidepressant response disadvantage over the non-anxious group. Given that anxiety has been shown to be a predictor of poor treatment response in bipolar depression when traditional treatments are used, our findings suggest a need for further investigations into ketamine's novel role in the treatment of anxious bipolar depression.", "doi": "10.1111/bdi.12277", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25400146/", "secondary_title": "Bipolar Disord"}

It is known that MDMA alters brain serotonin (5-HT) concentrations and that brain postsynaptic 5-HT2 receptors play a role in the regulation of brain microvasculature. Therefore, we used brain imaging to find out whether MDMA use predisposes one to cerebrovascular accidents by altering brain 5-HT neurotransmission. METHODS: The effects of MDMA use on brain cortical 5- HT(2A) receptor densities were studied using [123I]R91158 single-photon emission CT in 18 abstinent recent MDMA users, five former MDMA users, and 10 healthy control subjects. Furthermore, to examine whether changes in brain 5- HT(2A) receptor densities are associated with alterations in blood vessel volumes, we calculated relative cerebral blood volume maps from dynamic MR imaging sets in five MDMA users and six healthy control subjects. RESULTS: An analysis of variance revealed that mean cortical [123I]R91150 binding ratios were significantly lower in recent MDMA users than in former MDMA users and control subjects. This finding suggests down-regulation of 5-HT2 receptors caused by MDMA-induced 5-HT release. Furthermore, in MDMA users, low cortical 5-HT2 receptor densities were significantly associated with low cerebral blood vessel volumes (implicating vasoconstriction) and high cortical 5-HT2 receptor densities with high cerebral blood vessel volumes (implicating vasodilatation) in specific brain regions. CONCLUSION: These findings suggest a relationship between the serotonergic system and an altered regulation of 5-HT2 receptors in human MDMA users. MDMA users may therefore be at risk for cerebrovascular accidents resulting from alterations in the 5-HT neurotransmission system.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "American Journal of Neuroradiology"}

Inpatients, aged 18\u201085, diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, according to DSM\u2010IV), that have been offered and have accepted ECT, are eligible to participate. Patients must be proficient in spoken and written Swedish, and score \u2265 20 points on the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Exclusion criteria are known allergy to the active substance; co\u2010morbid conditions that could interfere with the treatment (e.g. primary psychosis); habitual difficulties to speak, hear, remember or reason; on\u2010going or recent (6 months) drug abuse; treatment according to LPT (Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd; Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act); and a number of cardiovascular conditions. Patients randomized to the experimental treatment receive intravenous infusions of racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), delivered over a period of forty minutes thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Patients in the control group receive ECT in line with standard procedures (including anesthesia, muscle relaxation and oxygenation) thrice weekly. ECT was chosen as the reference treatment as it is the most effective treatment for patients suffering from moderate to severe depression. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients in remission after 4 weeks of treatment in each arm. Remission is defined as a MADRS \u2264 10. The study uses a non\u2010inferiority design. Demonstrating superiority of ketamine was not an option based on the number of patients needed to gain sufficient power with such a design. Also, the investigators do not believe that ketamine treatment needs to be more effective, at least not in terms of the primary outcome. ECT is associated with side effects (in particular amnesia during the treatment period, but some patients also report persistent memory problems) and patients need to be anaesthetised under the supervision of a anaesthesiologist. The treatment is thus fairly demanding and expensive. A significant amount of patients are also unwilling to undergo ECT. Given non\u2010 inferiority of ketamine regarding the primary outcome, and given that it is associated with fewer side effects or shorter time to remission and does not involve the need for anaesthesia, in a risk\u2010benefit analysis the scale might be tipped in favour of ketamine, even if it is not superior per se. Secondary outcomes include proportion of patients in re mission and /or response and symptomatic relief at follow\u2010up time points (3, 6 and 12 months after treatment cessation). Also addressed is how the two treatments affect cognition. A computerized test battery, the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is administered prior to the first treatment, after two weeks, shortly after remission and at three additional time points (3, 6 and 12 months) after conclusion of the treatment. See figure for specification and description of cognitive tests. Blood samples are drawn before the first treatment and 2\u20103 months after finishing treatment. Apart from plasma and serum samples (which will be used for later analysis of potential biomarkers such as IL 6 and D\u2010serine), additional blood is collected for genomic DNA analysis. A total of 4 x 6 mL are taken at each occasion. Blood samples are stored at the regional biobank. Time to response will be analysed with parametric survival analysis (for changes in MADRS score) or with non\u2010parametric analysis of two\u2010way ordinal data with repeated measurements34 (for ordinal data). Cognitive data and biological samples will be analysed with t\u2010tests (paired or unpaired as appropriate) or with analysis of variance ANOVA. Study sample size was calculated based on actual or assumed remission rates, the primary outcome parameter of the study. A remission rate of 60% was set for the reference treatment (ECT). A non\u2010inferiority limit of 40% was set for the experimental intervention (ketamine). This is an arbitrary level, based on an ssumption of fewer and milder side effects, faster antidepressant effect and the fact that the patients do not need to be anaesthetized and given muscle relaxants. With the above limits, a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%, 97 patients are required in each arm, according to: n = (2 * 8,4 * p(1\u2010p) / difference2), where \"2\" and \"8,4\" are derived from significance and power levels, p are the (actual and assumed) levels for the proportion of patients reaching remission for ECT and ketamine (60% and 40% respectively).

Most of the acute effects of MDMA including its mood, cardiostimulant, and thermogenic effects can be attributed to the release of serotonin (5\u2010hydroxytryptamine, 5\u2010 HT) [1]. Accordingly, we hypothesized that genetic variants including single\u2010nucleotide polymorphisms and polymorphic regions in the 5\u2010HT system genes influence the acute responses to MDMA in humans. Methods: We characterized the effect of common genetic variants within genes coding for the 5\u2010HT system (TPH1 rs1800532 and rs1799913, TPH2 rs7305115, 5\u2010HTR1A rs6295, 5\u2010HTR1B rs6296, 5\u2010HTR2A rs6313, and SLC6A4 5\u2010HTTLPR and rs25531) on the acute physiological and subjective response to 125 mg MDMA compared to placebo in 124 healthy subjects (64 women) using data derived from eight similar randomized, double\u2010blind, placebocontrolled crossover studies from the same laboratory.

The area under the MDMA plasma concentration\u2010 time curve from 0\u20106 hours was included as covariate in the ANOVAs. Results were additionally corrected for multiple testing using the Nyholt method. Results: Carriers of the 5\u2010HTR2A rs6313 A\u2010allele displayed higher scores of \u201cgood drug effect\u201d compared to homozygous G\u2010carriers (mean \u00b1 SD increase: 80 \u00b1 25 versus 66 \u00b1 29; F1,121=6.93, p = 0.01).

MDMA produced a higher peak increase in body temperature in G\u2010allele carriers of the TPH2 rs7305115 compared to homozygous A\u2010allele individuals (0.3 \u00b1 0.5 versus \u20100.1 \u00b1 0.6 \u00b0C; F1,121=4.84, p= 0.01).

Conclusion: The findings suggest that variations in genes coding for 5\u2010HT system targets do not significantly influence the effects of MDMA in healthy subjects and are unlikely to play a role in MDMA intoxications despite the clear role of 5\u2010HT as a mediator of MDMA's effects and toxicity.", "doi": "10.1080/15563650.2019.1598646", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38630272/", "secondary_title": "Clinical toxicology"}

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2020-14569-002[/rid]). Background: While electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is considered the gold standard for acute treatment of patients with otherwise treatment-resistant depression, ketamine has recently emerged as a fast-acting treatment alternative for these patients. Efficacy and onset of action are currently among the main factors that influence clinical decision making, however, the effect of these treatments on cognitive functions should also be a crucial point, given that cognitive impairment in depression is strongly related to disease burden and functional recovery. ECT is known to induce transient cognitive impairment, while little is known about ketamine's impact on cognition. This study therefore aims to compare ECT and serial ketamine administration not only with regard to their antidepressant efficacy but also to acute neurocognitive effects. Methods: Fifty patients suffering from depression were treated with either serial ketamine infusions or ECT. Depression severity and cognitive functions were assessed before, during, and after treatment. Results: ECT and ketamine administration were equally effective, however, the antidepressant effects of ketamine occurred faster. Ketamine improved neurocognitive functioning, especially attention and executive functions, whereas ECT was related to a small overall decrease in cognitive performance. Conclusions: Due to its pro-cognitive effects and faster antidepressant effect, serial ketamine administration might be a more favorable short-term treatment option than ECT. Limitations: As this research employed a naturalistic study design, patients were not systematically randomized, there was no control group and patients received concurrent and partially changing medications during treatment.

RESULTS: Our findings revealed increased anterior cingulate cortex connectivity within the salience network, decreased posterior cingulate cortex connectivity within the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the salience and default mode networks 1 day after the session in the ayahuasca group compared to placebo. Connectivity of primary sensory networks did not differ between groups. Salience network connectivity increases correlated with altered somesthesia scores, decreased default mode network connectivity correlated with altered volition scores, and increased salience default mode network connectivity correlated with altered affect scores. CONCLUSION: These findings provide preliminary evidence for subacute functional changes induced by the psychedelic ayahuasca on higher-order cognitive brain networks that support interoceptive, affective, and self-referential functions.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881120909409", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32255395/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

OBJECTIVES: Evaluate the effectiveness and safety of esketamine nasal spray in a clinical sample of patients with TRD from several Italian mental health services. METHODS: REAL-ESK study is an observational, retrospective and multicentric study comprising a total of 116 TRD patients treated with esketamine nasal spray. Anamnestic data and psychometric assessment (MADRS, HAMD-21, HAM-A) were collected from medical records at baseline (T0), one month (T1) and three month (T2) follow-ups. RESULTS: A significant reduction of depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0. A dramatic increase in clinical response (64.2 %) and remission rates (40.6 %) was detected at T2 compared to T1. No unexpected safety concerns were observed, side effects rates were comparable to those reported in RCTs. No differences in efficacy have been found among patients with and without psychiatric comorbidities. LIMITATIONS: The open design of the study and the absence of a placebo or active comparator group are limitations. The study lacks an inter-rater reliability evaluation of the assessments among the different centres. Side effects evaluation did not involve any specific scale.

AIMS: In this investigation, we used the resting functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to determine the effects of ketamine on the functional connectivity (FC) of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related circuits in patients with TRD. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with TRD were recruited and randomly divided into three groups on the basis of ketamine infusion dose: 0.5\u202fmg/kg (standard dose), 0.2\u202fmg/kg (low dose), or normal saline (a placebo infusion).

RESULTS: The standard-dose group showed a reduction in the FC of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right dorsolateral (dl)PFC with the other frontal regions. The low-dose group demonstrated a more pervasive reduction of FC in the bilateral dACC with other frontal and parietal regions. A negative correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the reduction in the FC between the left dACC and right ACC regions in the standard-dose group, whereas a positive correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the increase in the FC between the right dlPFC and left superior parietal region in the low-dose group.

Caluori, Patrick Vizeli and Matthias E. Liechti (Psychopharmacology, 2022[Jun], Vol 239[6], 1893-1905). In the published article, the column headers of Table 1 are incorrectly presented. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-85913-001[/rid].) Rationale: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. Objectives: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. Results: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose\u2013response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 \u00b5g doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38\u00b0 was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered.

However, it is not fully understood how MDMA alters basic emotional processes to produce these effects, or whether it produces corresponding changes in actual social behavior. Here, we examined how MDMA affects perceptions of and responses to emotional expressions, and tested its effects on behavior during a social interaction. We also examined whether MDMA's prosocial effects related to a measure of abuse liability. METHODS: Over three sessions, 36 healthy volunteers with previous ecstasy use received MDMA (0.75, 1.5\u00a0mg/kg) and placebo under double-blind conditions. We measured (i) mood and cardiovascular effects, (ii) perception of and psychophysiological responses to emotional expressions, (iii) use of positive and negative words in a social interaction, and (iv) perceptions of an interaction partner. We then tested whether these effects predicted desire to take the drug again. RESULTS: MDMA slowed perception of angry expressions, increased psychophysiological responses to happy expressions, and increased positive word use and perceptions of partner empathy and regard in a social interaction. These effects were not strongly related to desire to take the drug again. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA alters basic emotional processes by slowing identification of negative emotions and increasing responses to positive emotions in others. Further, it positively affects behavior and perceptions during actual social interaction.

METHODS: Eighty-one patients scheduled for abdominal surgery were prospectively randomized under double-blind conditions to three groups: (1) PERI group receiving intraoperative and postoperative ketamine for the first 48 h after surgery (2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) after a 0.5 mg/kg bolus); (2) INTRA group receiving intraoperative ketamine administration only (2 microg x kg(-1) x min(-1) after a 0.5 mg/kg bolus); and (3) CTRL group receiving placebo.

Method: A comprehensive neuropsychological investigation was conducted in 100 abstinent ecstasy users and 100 matched non-user counterparts on standardized measures of working memory, verbal and non-verbal memory, verbal and figural fluency, and selective and switching attention. Results: Abstinent ecstasy users were impaired on verbal and non-verbal memory, complex attention, and verbal fluency, but not on working memory, relative to their non-user counterparts. Of particular interest was the fact that abstinent ecstasy users performed better on figural fluency relative to their non-user counterparts. In addition, only cumulative ecstasy consumption correlated with neuropsychological performances among abstinent ecstasy users. Canonical discriminant analysis yielded verbal and visual memory, switching attention, and verbal fluency as potential core neuropsychological variables for differentiating abstinent ecstasy users from non-users. Levels of depression and general non-verbal intelligence, as measured by the Beck Depression Inventory and the test of non-verbal Intelligence, respectively, were not likely to affect these findings, since these measures were matched between ecstasy users and non-users.

Background: Growing evidence suggests a rapid antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine infusion in Caucasian patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the antisuicidal effects of ketamine on Taiwanese patients with TRD remains unknown. Methods: Seventy-one patients with TRD were randomly classified into three treatment groups: 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline (placebo) infusion. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) were applied prior to initiation of test infusions, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on Days 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 14 after ketamine or placebo infusion. Item 3 (suicide) of the HAMD and item 10 (suicidal thoughts) of the MADRS were extracted for generalized estimating equation (GEE) model analyses to investigate the antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) Val66Met polymorphism was genotyped. Results: The GEE model revealed significant group (p = 0.007) and time (p = 0.004) effects on suicidal symptoms over times (prior to infusion to day 14 postinfusion). The group that received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited a significantly lower score in item 3 of the HAMD and item 10 of the MADRS compared with the groups that received 0.2 mg/kg ketamine or placebo infusion. Among those carrying any Val allele of BDNF, both 0.5 and 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusions were effective in reducing suicidal thoughts; however, among those with Met/Met of BDNF, only 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion was effective in reducing suicidal thoughts. Discussion: A single low-dose ketamine infusion was effective in reducing suicidal ideation among Taiwanese patients with TRD.

OBJECTIVE: To assess the efficacy, safety, and dose-response of intranasal esketamine hydrochloride in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This phase 2, double-blind, doubly randomized, delayed-start, placebo-controlled study was conducted in multiple outpatient referral centers from January 28, 2014, to September 25, 2015. The study consisted of 4 phases: (1) screening, (2) double-blind treatment (days 1-15), composed of two 1-week periods, (3) optional open-label treatment (days 15-74), and (4) posttreatment follow-up (8 weeks). One hundred twenty-six adults with a DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of MDD and history of inadequate response to 2 or more antidepressants (ie, TRD) were screened, 67 were randomized, and 60 completed both double-blind periods. Intent-to-treat analysis was used in evaluation of the findings. INTERVENTIONS: In period 1, participants were randomized (3:1:1:1) to placebo (n\u2009=\u200933), esketamine 28 mg (n\u2009=\u200911), 56 mg (n\u2009=\u200911), or 84 mg (n\u2009=\u200912) twice weekly. In period 2, 28 placebo-treated participants with moderate-to-severe symptoms were rerandomized (1:1:1:1) to 1 of the 4 treatment arms; those with mild symptoms continued receiving placebo. Participants continued their existing antidepressant treatment during the study. During the open-label phase, dosing frequency was reduced from twice weekly to weekly, and then to every 2 weeks. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point was change from baseline to day 8 (each period) in the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. RESULTS: Sixty-seven participants (38 women, mean [SD] age, 44.7 [10.0] years) were included in the efficacy and safety analyses. Change (least squares mean [SE] difference vs placebo) in MADRS total score (both periods combined) in all 3 esketamine groups was superior to placebo (esketamine 28 mg: -4.2 [2.09], P\u2009=\u2009.02; 56 mg: -6.3 [2.07], P\u2009=\u2009.001; 84 mg: -9.0 [2.13], P\u2009<\u2009.001), with a significant ascending dose-response relationship (P\u2009<\u2009.001). Improvement in depressive symptoms appeared to be sustained (-7.2 [1.84]) despite reduced dosing frequency in the open-label phase. Three of 56 (5%) esketamine-treated participants during the double-blind phase vs none receiving placebo and 1 of 57 participants (2%) during the open-label phase had adverse events that led to study discontinuation (1 event each of syncope, headache, dissociative syndrome, and ectopic pregnancy). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this first clinical study to date of intranasal esketamine for TRD, antidepressant effect was rapid in onset and dose related.

Weighted interview response rates ranged from 64.9% to 75.6% during the study time frame. From 2008 to 2019, past-year use of LSD increased significantly more among adults with major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.5%; 2019 prevalence, 1.8%; prevalence difference [PD], 1.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%]) compared with adults without major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.2%; 2019 prevalence, 0.8%; PD, 0.6% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.7%]) (difference in difference, 0.8% [95% CI, 0.5%-1.1%]). This difference was particularly pronounced among young adults aged 34 years or younger (PD among those aged 18-25 years with depression, 3.3% [95% CI, 2.5%-4.2%]; PD among those aged 26-34 years with depression, 2.7% [95% CI, 1.6%-3.8%]) and individuals with incomes less than $75 000 per year (PD among those with income <$20 000, 1.9% [95% CI, 1.3%-2.6%]; PD among those with income $20 000-$49 999, 1.5% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.1%]; PD among those with income $50 000-$74 999, 1.3% [95% CI, 0.7%-2.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, from 2008 to 2019, there was a disproportionate increase in the prevalence of past-year LSD use among US adults with past-year depression. Among those with depression, this increase was particularly strong among younger adults and those with lower household incomes. Among individuals with depression who also report LSD use, clinicians should discuss potential strategies for mitigating harm and maximizing benefits in medically unsupervised settings.", "doi": "10.1001/jamapsychiatry.2023.3867", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37819655/", "secondary_title": "JAMA psychiatry"}

However, at substantially higher doses, ketamine has shown mu-opioid receptor (MOR-gene symbol: OPRM1) agonist effects. Preliminary clinical studies showed conflicting results on whether naltrexone, a MOR antagonist, blocks the antidepressant action of ketamine. We examined drug-induced or endogenous MOR involvement in the antidepressant and dissociative responses to esketamine by assessing the effects of a functional single nucleotide polymorphism rs1799971 (A118G) of OPRM1, which is known to alter MOR agonist-mediated responses. METHODS: Participants with treatment-resistant depression from 2 phase III, double-blind, controlled trials of esketamine (or placebo) nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant were genotyped for rs1799971. Participants received the experimental agents twice weekly for 4 weeks. Antidepressant responses were rated using the change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score on days 2 and 28 post-dose initiation, and dissociative side effects were assessed using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative-States Scale at 40 minutes post-dose on days 1 and 25. RESULTS: In the esketamine + antidepressant arm, no significant genotype effect of single nucleotide polymorphism rs1799971 (A118G) on MADRS score reductions was detected on either day 2 or 28. By contrast, in the antidepressant + placebo arm, there was a significant genotype effect on MADRS score reductions on day 2 and a nonsignificant trend on day 28 towards an improvement in depression symptoms in G-allele carriers. No significant genotype effects on dissociative responses were detected. CONCLUSIONS: Variation in rs1799971 (A118G) did not affect the antidepressant response to esketamine + antidepressant.

We sought to systematically compare the anesthetic efficacy of ketamine, propofol, and dexmedetomidine for electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients.

Dexmedetomidine-treated patients showed their marked satisfaction, while those treated with propofol had shorter recovery time, shorter seizure duration, and shorter time to achieve an Aldrete score of 9-10 and increased relaxation, and next dexmedetomidine produced deeper relaxation. Propofol could shorten recovery time and seizure duration, and enhance relaxation, while dexmedetomidine was associated with higher patient satisfaction. Considering that any anesthetic which does not shorten seizure duration may serve efficiently for ECT and that ketamine-treated patients had more prolonged seizure duration, the preferred drug can hence be considered from various angles, thereby offering anesthetic agents with highly favorable efficacy in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder patients needing ECT.

Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness, and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system. METHOD: 100 \u03bcg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment. Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI-to-ROI and ROI-to-voxel approaches. Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects. RESULTS: LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D-ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions. Furthermore, LSD-induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects. CONCLUSION: Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions.

This controlled trial assessed the effects of ayahuasca on speech performance and anxiety in individuals with social anxiety disorder. METHODS: Seventeen volunteers with social anxiety disorder participated in a pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized, parallel-group trial. Self-perception of performance during a public-speaking test was assessed with the Self-statements During Public Speaking Scale primary outcome). Secondary outcomes included anxiety/subjective effects (Visual Analog Mood Scale; Bodily Symptoms Scale), recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE), tolerability measures (cardiovascular measures, self-reports), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma levels.

One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target, which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders, are deficits in social cognitive abilities. However, the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown.

Second, the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad, thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time.

Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) may underlie the expression of psychotic symptoms. This study used a roving mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to investigate whether the encoding of PE is affected by pharmacological manipulation of NMDAR or 5-HT(2A)R, and whether the encoding of PE under placebo can be used to predict drug-induced symptoms. Using a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design, S-ketamine and psilocybin, respectively, were administrated to two groups of healthy subjects. Psychological alterations were assessed using a revised version of the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC-R) questionnaire. As an index of PE, we computed changes in MMN amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding standards (MMN memory trace effect) during a roving paradigm. S-ketamine, but not psilocybin, disrupted PE processing as expressed by a frontally disrupted MMN memory trace effect. Although both drugs produced positive-like symptoms, the extent of PE processing under placebo only correlated significantly with the severity of cognitive impairments induced by S-ketamine. Our results suggest that the NMDAR, but not the 5-HT(2A)R system, is implicated in PE processing during the MMN paradigm, and that aberrant PE signaling may contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments. The assessment of the MMN memory trace in schizophrenia may allow detecting early phases of the illness and might also serve to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments, in particular of cognitive impairments.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2011.261", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22030715/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

However, effects of ketamine on more objective timing tasks have not yet been measured in humans, nor has it been established that timing effects are not merely secondary to a more general dysfunction in working memory (WM). Objective and methods: In a double-blind placebo-controlled crossover study, we characterised the effects of ketamine (100 ng/ml blood plasma level) on performance of perceptual timing and colour discrimination tasks, which were matched for WM and attentional demands. To test the ubiquity of ketamine's effects on timing, we also examined two distinct measures of temporal predictability. Results: Ketamine significantly distorted the subjective experience of time as measured by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scales. Critically, ketamine also impaired accuracy on the perceptual timing task while having no effect on performance of the colour perception task. Although ketamine did not impair the ability to use prelearned temporal (or spatial) cues to predict target onset (or location), it did slow reaction times at long delays following non-informative neutral cues, suggesting an impaired ability to use the unidirectional flow of time itself to make temporal predictions. Conclusions: Ketamine induced selective impairments in timing, which could not be explained by more fundamental effects on the ability to hold information in WM. Rather our collected findings suggest that ketamine may disturb timing by selectively impairing the way in which information is temporally manipulated within WM.

We also investigated a possible association between ecstasy use and verbal fluency in subjects genotyped for 5-HTT (5-HTTLPR and 5-HTTVNTR) and COMT (val108/158met, rs165599 and rs2097603) polymorphisms, in order to find a potential implication of genetic factors. Ecstasy polydrug users (n = 30) and non-ecstasy users (n = 41) were evaluated in both semantic and phonemic fluency. Results showed that ecstasy users had poorer semantic (but not phonemic) fluency performance than controls. Detailed analysis of clustering and switching performance revealed that this impairment was associated with poorer clustering mechanisms. Clustering was also modulated by the COMT rs165599 polymorphism independently of the group. A specific effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on switching performance was also found, with ss carriers performing significantly worse than ls and ll carriers, suggesting a serotonin modulation of frontal-executive flexibility. Based on the impaired clustering and switching strategies observed in ecstasy users, it might be proposed that both semantic knowledge and retrieval are impaired in this population. The verbal fluency deficit in ecstasy users may be attributable to a disruption of frontal-striatal circuits directly related with the serotonin function as well as a depletion of lexical-semantic stores mediated by temporal structures. \u00a9 The Author(s) 2010.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881109354926", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20080926/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology"}

However, a recent arterial spin labeling (ASL) study suggests psilocybin may lead to hypo-perfusion in various brain regions. In this placebo-controlled, double-blind study we used pseudo-continuous ASL (pCASL) to measure perfusion changes, with and without adjustment for global brain perfusion, after two doses of oral psilocybin (low dose: 0.160\u00a0mg/kg; high dose: 0.215\u00a0mg/kg) in two groups of healthy controls (n\u00a0=\u00a029 in both groups, total N\u00a0=\u00a058) during rest. We controlled for sex and age and used family-wise error corrected p values in all neuroimaging analyses. Both dose groups reported profound subjective drug effects as measured by the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) with the high dose inducing significantly larger effects in four out of the 11 scales. After adjusting for global brain perfusion, psilocybin increased relative perfusion in distinct right hemispheric frontal and temporal regions and bilaterally in the anterior insula and decreased perfusion in left hemispheric parietal and temporal cortices and left subcortical regions. Whereas, psilocybin significantly reduced absolute perfusion in frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital lobes, and bilateral amygdalae, anterior cingulate, insula, striatal regions, and hippocampi. Our analyses demonstrate consistency with both the hyperfrontal hypothesis of psilocybin and the more recent study demonstrating decreased perfusion, depending on analysis method. Importantly, our data illustrate that relative changes in perfusion should be understood and interpreted in relation to absolute signal variations.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2017.07.020", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28711736/", "secondary_title": "Neuroimage"}
