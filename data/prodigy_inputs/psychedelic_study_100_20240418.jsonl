Experimental tasks involving emotional processing can be used during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to investigate ketamine's effects on brain function in major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined ketamine's effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during an emotional processing task. METHODS: A total of 33 individuals with treatment-resistant MDD and 24 healthy control participants (HCs) took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants received ketamine and placebo infusions 2 weeks apart, and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted at baseline and 2 days after each infusion. Blood oxygen level-dependent signal was measured during an emotional processing task, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze differences in activation among group, drug, and task-specific factors. RESULTS: A group-by-drug interaction was observed in several brain regions, including a right frontal cluster extending into the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Participants with MDD had greater activity than HCs after placebo infusion but showed lower activity after ketamine infusion, which was similar to the activity in HCs after placebo. A group-by-drug-by-task condition interaction was also found, which showed further differences that varied between implicit and explicit emotional conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The main results indicate that ketamine had differential effects on brain activity in participants with MDD versus HCs. The pattern of activation in participants with MDD after ketamine infusion resembled the activation in HCs after placebo infusion, suggesting a normalization of function during emotional processing. The findings contribute to a better understanding of ketamine's actions in the brain.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.01.005", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30826253/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging"}

Active components include beta-carboline alkaloids and the hallucinogen N-N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). This review aimed to identify and summarize the literature on the safety and effectiveness of ayahuasca among recreational users. METHOD: A comprehensive literature search was done on November 1, 2019 in the following six databases: PubMed(MEDLINE), Ovid Embase, Ovid International Pharmaceutical Abstracts, LILACS, Scopus, and Web of Science. Articles were included if they were original research published in English, Spanish, or Portuguese, among human participants using oral ayahuasca for neuropsychiatric effects. Chemical or pharmacological analyses, brain imaging studies, and studies examining the use of ayahuasca within a religious context were excluded. RESULTS: 5750 unique titles were identified through the database searches, with an additional 19 titles identified through manual searches. Ultimately, 39 met all the criteria for inclusion. Articles were organized into 4 themes: (1) Case reports and case series; (2) The use of ayahuasca for depression or grief; (3) The use of ayahuasca and other psychiatric or neuropsychological outcomes; and (4) Studies examining ayahuasca use and physiologic outcomes. Ayahuasca use is associated with a risk of both psychiatric and non-psychiatric events including hallucinations, agitation or aggression, vomiting, seizure, and rhabdomyolysis. Five fatalities have been reported in the literature following ayahuasca use. Open-label studies assessing ayahuasca use in depression found favorable results persisting across 21 days. Ayahuasca was also found to influence the MINDSENS scale for mindfulness, with mixed results observed for impact of ayahuasca on cognitive function and creativity, and benefits observed for measures of self-acceptance and overall wellbeing. CONCLUSIONS: To date, evidence on benefits for the management of depression, anxiety, and other mental health disorders is mixed, with some evidence suggesting improvements in mindfulness measures and creativity that are generally short-lived, and multiple case reports suggesting the potential for harm and interactions.", "doi": "10.1016/j.tmaid.2021.102206", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34785376/", "secondary_title": "Travel Med Infect Dis"}

Criticisms have included that study designs and reporting styles bias positive over negative outcomes. The present study was motivated by a desire to address this alleged bias by intentionally focusing exclusively on negative outcomes, defined as self-perceived 'negative' psychological responses lasting for at least 72\u00a0h after psychedelic use. A strong justification for this selective focus was that it might improve our ability to capture otherwise missed cases of negative response, enabling us to validate their existence and better examine their nature, as well as possible causes, which could inspire risk-mitigation strategies. Via advertisements posted on social media, individuals were recruited who reported experiencing negative psychological responses to psychedelics (defined as classic psychedelics plus MDMA) lasting for greater than 72\u00a0h since using. Volunteers were directed to an online questionnaire requiring quantitative and qualitative input. A key second phase of this study involved reviewing all of the submitted cases, identifying the most severe-e.g., where new psychiatric diagnoses were made or pre-existing symptoms made worse post psychedelic-use-and inviting these individuals to participate in a semi-structured interview with two members of our research team, during which participant experiences and backgrounds were examined in greater depth. Based on the content of these interviews, a brief summary of each case was compiled, and an explorative thematic analysis was used to identify salient and consistent themes and infer common causes. 32 individuals fully completed an onboarding questionnaire (56% male, 53%\u2009<\u2009age 25); 37.5% of completers had a psychiatric diagnosis that emerged after their psychedelic experience, and anxiety symptoms arose or worsened in 87%. Twenty of the seemingly severer cases were invited to be interviewed; of these, 15 accepted an in-depth interview that lasted on average 60\u00a0min. This sample was 40% male, mean age\u2009=\u200931\u2009\u00b1\u20097. Five of the 15 (i.e., 33%) reported receiving new psychiatric diagnoses after psychedelic-use and all fifteen reported the occurrence or worsening of psychiatric symptoms post use, with a predominance of anxiety symptoms (93%). Distilling the content of the interviews suggested the following potential causal factors: unsafe or complex environments during or surrounding the experience, unpleasant acute experiences (classic psychedelics), prior psychological vulnerabilities, high- or unknown drug quantities and young age. The current exploratory findings corroborate the reality of mental health iatrogenesis via psychedelic-use but due to design limitations and sample size, cannot be used to infer on its prevalence. Based on interview reports, we can infer a common, albeit multifaceted, causal mechanism, namely the combining of a pro-plasticity drug-that was often 'over-dosed'-with adverse contextual conditions and/or special psychological vulnerability-either by young age or significant psychiatric history. Results should be interpreted with caution due to the small sample size and selective sample and study focus.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-023-41145-x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37749109/", "secondary_title": "Sci Rep"}

Rationale: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. Objectives: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. Results: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose\u2013response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 \u00b5g doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38\u00b0 was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered. Six subjects reported transient flashback phenomena.

{"record_id": 6050, "keywords": "['Ketamine']", "text": "Cognitive Biases Under Ketamine.^\nKetamine is a non\u2010competitive glutamate NMDA antagonist. The infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine results in sub\u2010clinical schizophrenia\u2010like positive symptoms in healthy controls. The safety of ketamine use is attested by its daily use in child anesthesia and by a number of studies showing there is no medical, neural or cognitive complication after a single infusion. Low dose ketamine is therefore a valid and safe human model to study psychosis. The objective of the study is to characterise cognitive biases resulting from low dose ketamine infusion, used as a pharmacological model of psychosis. We designed four distinct paradigms designed to better characterize these biases. P1 is a neuroeconomic task where subjects have to make binary choices to maximize gains, in a situation where either direct feedback information or additional counterfactual information is provided. P2 is a neuroeconomic task where a direct manipulation of uncertainty is performed, and its impact on decision is measured. P3 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to classify a gabor orientation into the diagonal or cardinal category based on a rapidly presented series of individual gabors. The contribution of each piece of evidence to the final decision is measured and correlated to fluctuations in eeg data. P4 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to determine the global orientation of a series of sequentially presented gabor stimulus. There are interim responses and final responses, the influence of the former on the latter (confirmation bias) is studied. Our assumption is that low dose ketamine results in reasoning biases by impairing the way uncertainty is monitored and taken into account for decision making. The study design is as follows : randomized, double blind, controlled, against placebo, cross\u2010over. Healthy subjects will therefore be randomized to receive on the first visit either a ketamine infusion or a placebo infusion. The alternative condition will be applied on the second visit. Ketamine will be prepared using KETAMINE PANPHARMA 250 mg/5mL, and infusion will be. This procedure should produce ketamine plasmatic levels of 140ng/ml. Two blood samples will be taken 30 and 90 minutes after infusion start to record actual ketamine plasmatic levels. Placebo infusion will follow the same pattern of infusion, prepared using CHLORURE DE SODIUM 0,9% MACOPHARMA. We will record both behavioral, electrophysiologic and psychometric data. Detailed assumptions are as folllows : Behavioral data : P1 and 2 : Significant impairment with ketamine in the ability to take into account uncertainty to guide decisions. P3 : Significant decrease with ketamine in the ability to classify correctly the mean spatial orientation of stimuli according to the cardinal or diagonal direction. P4 : Significant increase with ketamine in the confirmation bias following the interim choice. Electroencephalographic data : Correlation between the impairment in the ability to take into account uncertainty and the alteration of the Error Related Negativity and late inhibitory eeg signals, and decreased long distance synchrony as indicated by spectral analysis (P1 and 2). The covariation of brain activity with the weight each stimuli sample will have in the final decision, will be increased as a result of ketamine infusion (P3). Psychometric data : Increase in the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) as a result of ketamine infusion. The BPRS scale records the psychotic symtoms and is translated and validated in a french population sample.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02235012"}

Although acute subjective effects of LSD are mostly positive, negative subjective effects, including anxiety, may occur. The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as \"candyflipping.\" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100\u2009mg) and LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (C(max) and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100\u2009mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g).

The psychometric potential of the non-MEQ items of the PES remains largely unexplored. Aims: We investigated whether the PES also yields subscales besides the MEQ30 subscales. Methods: Data from 239 PES measurements (140 healthy participants) from six studies with moderate to high doses of lysergic acid diethylamide and/or psilocybin were included. New subscales (with items other than MEQ30) were created and validated as follows: (1) theoretical derivation of candidate items; (2) removal of items with rare experiences; (3) exploratory factor analysis; and (4) confirmatory factor analysis. Correlations of subscales within the PES and between the PES and the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Scale (5D-ASC) were performed. In addition, a cluster analysis using all items (except rare experiences) was performed. Results: The reliability of the four original factors of the MEQ30 was confirmed and four additional factors for the non-MEQ items were revealed: paradoxicality, connectedness, visual experience, and distressing experience. The first two additional factors were strongly correlated with the MEQ30 mystical subscale. Adding the new subscales to the MEQ30 subscales increased the explained variance with the 5D-ASC. The cluster analysis confirmed our main results and provided additional insights for future psychedelic psychometrics. Conclusion: The study yields a new validated 6-factor structure for extended mystical experience (MEQ40: MEQ30 + Paradoxicality + Connectedness) and covers psychedelic experience as a whole more comprehensively than has hitherto been possible within a single questionnaire (PES48).

This paper proposes a model that utilises the PFM as informed by a previously published qualitative study of patient accounts of change processes in psilocybin therapy that identified themes of acceptance and connection as associated with positive outcomes. This new model, the ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) model presents the six psychological flexibility processes, renamed and rearranged in an acceptance triad (defusion, present moment focus, willingness) and a connection triad (self as context, values, committed action). This paper describes the ACE model and how it is being used in an ongoing trial of psilocybin treatment for major depression. It also describes qualitative evidence supportive of the idea that psychological flexibility may be key to characterizing the processes of change involved in psilocybin assisted therapy for depression. These and other results suggest that psilocybin may be specifically increasing psychological flexibility and point to the possibility that psychotherapy approaches incorporating the PFM may serve as a means to deepen and extend the benefits of psilocybin treatment, thus bridging the experiential gap between a potent inner experience and an outer life better lived.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jcbs.2019.12.004", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618649/", "secondary_title": "JOURNAL OF CONTEXTUAL BEHAVIORAL SCIENCE"}

METHODS: A total of 135 children, aged 2-5\u00a0years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I-II, scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (group D), oral ketamine 3\u00a0mg/kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2\u00a0\u03bcg/kg (group DK), or oral ketamine 6\u00a0mg/kg (group K) 30\u00a0min before surgery. Sedation state was evaluated every 10\u00a0min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation. Adverse events were recorded for 24\u00a0h postoperatively. The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation. RESULTS: The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47% with dexmedetomidine alone, 68% with ketamine alone, and 80% with combined premedication (P\u2009=\u20090.006). The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups. The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups (postoperative vomiting, P\u2009=\u20090.0041; respiratory-related complications during the perioperative period, P\u2009=\u20090.0032; and postoperative psychological/psychiatric adverse events, P\u2009=\u20090.0152). CONCLUSION: The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2\u00a0\u03bcg/kg and oral ketamine 3\u00a0mg/kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation, allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia.

One way that MDMA may produce positive 'prosocial' effects is by changing responses to emotional stimuli, especially stimuli with social content. Here, we examined for the first time how MDMA affects subjective responses to positive, negative and neutral emotional pictures with and without social content. We hypothesized that MDMA would dose-dependently increase reactivity to positive emotional stimuli and dampen reactivity to negative stimuli, and that these effects would be most pronounced for pictures with people in them. The data were obtained from two studies using similar designs with healthy occasional MDMA users (total N = 101). During each session, participants received MDMA (0, 0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg oral), and then rated their positive and negative responses to standardized positive, negative and neutral pictures with and without social content. MDMA increased positive ratings of positive social pictures, but reduced positive ratings of non-social positive pictures. We speculate this 'socially selective' effect contributes to the prosocial effects of MDMA by increasing the comparative value of social contact and closeness with others.

Here we report the age and gender of offenders, along with the concentrations of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine) in blood samples analyzed since the institution of the new legislation. Method: A forensic toxicology database (TOXBASE) was used to identify cases of DUID in which central stimulant amines were verified in blood during a 5-year period (2000-2004). Results: Amphetamine was present in 15,898 of 26,556 cases of DUID (60%) either alone or together with other licit or illicit drugs. In 6,094 cases, amphetamine was the only psychoactive substance in blood at mean (median) and highest concentrations of 1.01 mg/L (0.80 mg/L) and 11.9 mg/L, respectively. The users of amphetamine were mainly men (85% vs 15% women; p < .001), and men tended to be a few years older than the women; the mean (SD) age for men was 37 (9.2) years and for women it was 35 (8.1) years (p < .001).

The mean (median) and highest concentrations of ecstasy in 493 DUID offenders were 0.23 mg/L (0.10 mg/L) and 3.5 mg/L, respectively. The mean age of ecstasy users was 26 (7.2) years, which was about 10 years younger than those using amphetamine (p < .001). Conclusions: The high prevalence of amphetamines in blood of apprehended drivers in Sweden verifies widespread use of these stimulants as recreational drugs.

Quantitative linguistic analysis is a powerful tool to examine such differences. This study compared five psychedelic substance report groups and a non-psychedelic report group on quantitative linguistic markers of psychological states and processes derived from recreational use-based online experience reports. METHODS: Using 2947 publicly available online reports, we compared Ayahuasca and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT, analyzed together), ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin (mushroom), and antidepressant drug use experiences. We examined word frequencies related to various psychological states and processes and semantic proximity to psychedelic and mystical experience scales. RESULTS: Linguistic markers of psychological function indicated distinct effect profiles. For example, MDMA experience reports featured an emotionally intensifying profile accompanied by many cognitive process words and dynamic-personal language. In contrast, Ayahuasca and DMT experience reports involved relatively little emotional language, few cognitive process words, increased analytical thinking-associated language, and the most semantic similarity with psychedelic and mystical experience descriptions. LSD, psilocybin mushroom, and ketamine reports showed only small differences on the emotion-, analytical thinking-, psychedelic, and mystical experience-related language outcomes. Antidepressant reports featured more negative emotional and cognitive process-related words, fewer positive emotional and analytical thinking-related words, and were generally not similar to mystical and psychedelic language. CONCLUSION: This article addresses an existing research gap regarding the comparison of different psychedelic drugs on linguistic profiles of psychological states, processes, and experiences.

Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is a potent, rapid-onset, and short-acting psychedelic drug that has not yet been independently tested for the treatment of depression. The safety, tolerability, and efficacy of intravenous DMT were investigated in treatment-resistant individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and healthy controls (HC) in an open-label, fixed-order, dose-escalation (0.1\u2009mg/kg followed by 0.3\u2009mg/kg) exploratory phase 1 study that was conducted in a typical hospital setting with strategic psychoeducation/support, but minimal psychotherapy.

DMT increased blood pressure, heart rate, anxiety, psychedelic effects, and psychotomimetic effects, which resolved within 20-30\u2009min of injection. There were no dose-related differences in measures of drug reinforcement and abuse liability. In this small exploratory pilot study, intravenous DMT at doses of 0.1 and 0.3\u2009mg/kg was mostly safe and tolerated and may have next-day (rapid) antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant MDD.

This article documents 11 consecutive patients treated with intravenous ketamine and psychotherapy for co-occurring neuropathic pain and PTSD from July 2014 to December 2019. All patients in this series were diagnosed with chronic neuropathic pain who had: (i) previously failed multiple pain treatment modalities; (ii) currently manifested PTSD symptoms; and (iii) received ketamine infusion as a standard of care for the pain condition. All patients in this case series were tolerant to full agonist opioids but were not tolerant to the analgesic and anti- PTSD effects of ketamine. In addition, the ketamine infusion was instituted as part of a pain management protocol to discontinue opioid use. Thus, the findings suggesting therapeutic benefits of ketamine to treat psychiatric symptoms of PTSD are not likely mediated by opiates. The KEP-P2 psychotherapeutic experience appears unique when compared with regular, trauma-focused psychotherapy in the absence of ketamine, most notably the experience of what were at times extreme visions/hallucinations. These altered states of consciousness appeared to play a key role in the therapeutic outcome. The findings add to previous research showing that abbreviated forms of trauma-focused interventions for PTSD can be effective. The current form of treatment supports an even shorter duration of psychotherapy enhanced by the pharmacological aid of ketamine. We suggest that the current data, though an observational case series, do support the idea of using medicines (i.e., ketamine) to facilitate the imaginal re-experiencing of traumatic memories under conditions where defensive functioning is reduced. Not only may this general approach lead to more effective treatments for PTSD, but ketamine may be uniquely enhancing the neuroplasticity necessary for fear extinction and new memory formation. Randomized controlled trials are required to determine whether or not ketamine is efficacious to enhance PTSD psychotherapy outcomes as well as whether it is differentially effective for PTSD with or without pain comorbidity.

Although prior research has demonstrated associations between ecstasy use and favorable mental health outcomes, the associations between ecstasy and physical health have largely been unexplored. Thus, the goal of this study was to examine the associations between ecstasy use and physical health in a population-based survey sample. METHOD: This study utilized data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2005-2018), a yearly survey that collects information on substance use and health outcomes in a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. We used multinomial, ordered, and logistic regression models to test the associations between lifetime ecstasy use and various markers of physical health (self-reported body mass index, overall health, past year heart condition and/or cancer, past year heart disease, past year hypertension, and past year diabetes), controlling for a range of potential confounders. RESULTS: Lifetime ecstasy use was associated with significantly lower risk of self-reported overweightness and obesity (adjusted relative risk ratio range: 0.55-0.88) and lower odds of self-reported past year heart condition and/or cancer (adjusted odds ratio (aOR): 0.67), hypertension (aOR: 0.85), and diabetes (aOR: 0.58).

Results: Across a range of psychedelic substances and doses, reported pain scores improved substantially during and after psychedelic experiences. Two processes, Positive Reframing and Somatic Presence, were reliably identified as playing a role in improvements in mental wellbeing, relationship with pain, and physical (dis)comfort. Inclusion of other strategies such as mindfulness, breathwork, and movement were also widely reported. Due to the data's subjective nature, this paper is vulnerable to bias and makes no claims on causality or generalisability. Together, these results have been used to inform study design for a forthcoming trial. Conclusion: This pre-trial PI work gives us confidence to test psychedelic therapy for chronic pain in a forthcoming controlled trial. The results presented here will be instrumental in improving our ability to meet the needs of future study participants.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2021.735427", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34867525/", "secondary_title": "Front Psychiatry"}

Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects. METHODS: We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125\u00a0mg), methylphenidate (60\u00a0mg), modafinil (600\u00a0mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI). RESULTS: All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects.

It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged \u226565 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for \u22653 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline.

A series of clinical studies demonstrated that QEEG prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after one week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and precedes clinical improvement [2]. To date wasn't studied predictive value of cordance in response to single infusion of ketamine in depressive subjects. We hypothesized in our study that the changes in prefrontal cordance 24 hours after the infusion will predict sustained antidepressant response fourth day after the infusion. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Methods: In a double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over, randomized, placebocontrolled experiment we studied the influence of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) on theta cordance in a group of 27 right\u2010handed hospitalized depressive patients on stable antidepressant medication. Antidepressant response was defined as 50% decrease of depressive symptoms evaluated fourth and seventh day after infusion by means of Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). Psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale before and after the infusion [3]. Three EEG segments obtained before, after the infusion and 24 hours after the dosing were entered into spectral analyses. QEEG cordance values in theta frequency band were calculated according to UCLA algorithm from three prefrontal electrodes (Fz, Fp1, Fp2). Results: Responders (n = 11) to ketamine in compare to nonresponders (n = 16) showed significant difference in cordance values at the end of ketamine infusion (Spearman, p = 0.039). The cordance decrease, measured between the end of infusion and next day, positively correlated with ketamine antidepressant response (MADRS decrease) fourth day after infusion (twotailed Fisher's Exact test, df = 1, p = 0.0076) with NPV 90.9% (95% CI 64.3\u201099.5%) and PPV 62.5% (95% CI 44.2\u201068.4%). Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor\u2010ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. Conclusions: The reduction in theta prefrontal cordance could serve as a marker of ketamine's sustained antidepressant response, a hypothesis that should be tested in larger depressive population. The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. Our data indicate that ketamine (glutamatergic\u2010based drug) infusion immediately induces similar changes as monoaminergic\u2010based antidepressants do gradually after a series of downstream signalling steps.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology"}

Recent studies have proposed neuropsychoplastogenic effects as mechanisms underlying the enduring therapeutic effects of psilocybin. In an open-label study of 24 patients with major depressive disorder, we tested the enduring effects of psilocybin therapy on cognitive flexibility (perseverative errors on a set-shifting task), neural flexibility (dynamics of functional connectivity or dFC via functional magnetic resonance imaging), and neurometabolite concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in brain regions supporting cognitive flexibility and implicated in acute psilocybin effects (e.g., the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC). Psilocybin therapy increased cognitive flexibility for at least 4 weeks post-treatment, though these improvements were not correlated with the previously reported antidepressant effects. One week after psilocybin therapy, glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations were decreased in the ACC, and dFC was increased between the ACC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Surprisingly, greater increases in dFC between the ACC and PCC were associated with less improvement in cognitive flexibility after psilocybin therapy. Connectome-based predictive modeling demonstrated that baseline dFC emanating from the ACC predicted improvements in cognitive flexibility. In these models, greater baseline dFC was associated with better baseline cognitive flexibility but less improvement in cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between cognitive and neural flexibility.

Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful.

This was an open-label feasibility trial that enrolled 12 adults (18\u201365 years) with treatment-resistant moderately-severe/severe (PHQ-9 score \u2265 15) MDD (defined as failure to respond to two adequate trials of antidepressive treatments, including pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, ECT, or TMS) and who received a single IV ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg, infused over 40 min). This preliminary pilot study suggests a reduction of ACC GABA deficit may be a potential mechanism of action of ketamine. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter and extensive alteration of cortical GABAergic inhibitory circuit has been shown with chronic stress and depression leading to neuronal excitability. Thus, reducing GABA deficits could be a potential pathway to reduce neuronal excitability. Supporting this hypothesis would be prior studies which have indicated lower GABA levels in ACC in MDD but not remitted MDD. These data would suggest that ketamine actively engages central ACC GABA, and, if replicated, may represent a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment response. This is consistent with preclinical evidence highlighting countering GABAergic deficits with antidepressant therapies. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests ketamine reduces GABA deficits among TRD patients who remitted with ketamine infusion.

{"record_id": 4955, "keywords": NaN, "text": "Acute psychological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ``ecstasy'') are attenuated by the serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram.^\nIntroduction: We recently demonstrated that a moderate recreational dose of 3,4\u2010Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, \"Ecstasy\") produces an affective state of enhanced mood associated with mild derealisation phenomena, moderate thought disorder, and mostly without marked stimulation of psychomotor drive (Vollenweider et al. 1998). In animals, MDMA releases serotonin (5\u2010HT) and to a lesser extent dopamine (DA). This effect could be blocked by selective 5\u2010HT uptake inhibitors, suggesting that MDMA primarily acts at the presynaptic 5\u2010HT uptake site. It is unclear, however, which neurochemical receptors mediate the psychoactive effect of MDMA in humans and whether the 5\u2010HT carrier is involved. Methods: To elucidate the putative contribution of the 5\u2010HT uptake site in the mediation of MDMA's effects in humans, a double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled cross\u2010over design was used to investigate the pretreatment effects of either placebo or citalopram (40 mg iv) on the psychological effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg po). 16 healthy subjects (12 male, 4 female) were examined four times at a 2\u20104 week interval after either placebo, citalopram, MDMA or citalopram plus MDMA administration. The Altered State of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC\u2010OAV), the EWL mood rating scale (EWL) were used 120 minutes after drug intake to assess the effect of citalopram pre\u2010treatment on the subjective effects of MDMA. Data were analysed using ANCOVA and post hoc analysis. Results: Citalopram pre\u2010treatment attenuated MDMA\u2010induced \"positive mood\" (59%, p < .0001), \"mania\u2010like experience\" (75%, p < .001) and \"derealisation\" (62%, p < .0001) as measured by the ASC\u2010OAV scale. ASC\u2010OAV scores for \"Altered meaning of percepts\" (62%, p < .0001), \"facilitated imagination\" (76%, p < .04) as well as \"anxious derealisation\" (75%, p < .001), \"thought disorder\" (65%, p < .0001) and \"fear of loss of self\u2010control\" (80%, p < .001) were also reduced. The EWL scores \"well\u2010being\" (68%, p < .04), \"self\u2010confidence\" (87%, p < .04), \"extraversion\" (73%, p < .02) and \"activity\" (96%, p < .04) were all markedly reduced by citalopram as compared to MDMA alone. Conclusion: Citalopram pre\u2010treatment reduced MDMA\u2010induced alterations of consciousness and mood about 70% in this study. This finding provides strong evidence that the 5\u2010HT transporter plays a key role in mediating psychological effects of MDMA in humans. Moreover, the present finding is in line with the view that MDMA releases 5\u2010HT via the 5\u2010HT transporter. Therefore, MDMA could be used as a useful tool to study the function of 5\u2010HT in the modulation of mood and its role in affective disorders. However, other receptors (D2, 5\u2010HT2, ?2) might contribute to the psychoactive effect of MDMA and should be evaluated in similar designs.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "Journal of the european college of neuropsychopharmacology"}

We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine would reduce immediate postoperative opioid consumption compared with placebo in chronic pain patients with opioid dependency undergoing lumbar spinal fusion surgery.

Both groups received clonidine, titrated to a maximum of 0.6\u2009mg orally daily, during the infusion to mitigate side effects of ketamine. Participants were followed for 8 weeks to examine potential antidepressant effects. Results All 20 participants completed the infusion.

Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users.

Preliminary studies in animals and humans suggest that ayahuasca, psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) may have antidepressive, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive properties. Thus, we conducted a systematic review of clinical trials published from 1990 until 2015, assessing these therapeutic properties.

A substantial proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment; e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always efficacious. Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high\u2010affinity antagonist of the NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and \u03bc\u2010opioid receptors. During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6\u20108]. These trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub\u2010anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post\u2010ketamine infusion [9, 10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration of improvement. D\u2010cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA\u2010R glycine site, with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS dosages, such as 50\u2010500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher dosages (500\u20101000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA\u2010R function, similarly to ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we reason that DCS post\u2010ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients when compared to placebo. Study Design 2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS\u226525%) after 6 ketamine infusions, ketamine administration (weeks 1\u20103: days 1\u201021) will be stopped and patients will start receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the following manner: 1. Week 4: Days 22\u201024 \u2010 250mg/d, one pill per day Well\u2010being assessment and adverse effect evaluation before drug elevation. 2. Mid\u2010week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25\u201042 \u2010 500mg/d, two pills per day 3. Week 7: Day 43\u201049 \u2010 750mg/d, three pills per day 4. Weeks 8\u201011: Days 50\u201077 \u2010 1000mg/d four pills per day 3. Pyridoxine 200\u2010300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the study. 4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study. 1. Patients will undergo 6 ketamine infusions within a 3\u2010week period. Intravenous ketamine will be administrated by a senior anesthesiologist and under the supervision of a senior psychiatrist hence ensuring patient safety. We believe that sub\u2010anesthetic ketamine infusion will be safer and will cause fewer side effects than ECT. The procedure will be explained in detail to each patient, and written consent will be obtained. After a psychiatric and medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist and a senior anesthesiologist, patients will be given ketamine nfusion added on to their antidepressant therapy. A slow ketamine infusion of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes will be given to the patients. Patients will be monitored by the experienced staff which includes a senior anesthesiologist and a nurse as well as a psychiatrist who will be available nearby. All patients will be monitored continuously for heart rate and rhythm and oxygen saturation, and blood pressure will be measured at 10 minutes intervals. Heart rate variability will be measured and analyzed after ketamine treatment. Measurements will be performed during the ketamine infusion at baseline, after 3 and 6 treatments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS). In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale (CGI\u2010S) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI\u2010I) will be performed 2 hours after treatment. In many cases, patients with depression also suffer from alexithymia: inappropriate identification of emotions. Alexithymia will be measured at baseline after 3 and 6 treatments. Ketamine infusion will be stopped in cases of a 20% or above increase in blood pressure or in heart rate over baseline values and/ or an acute dissociative state. Patients will be discharged to their homes at least three hours from end of infusion. Due to the potential effect of ketamine each patient will need to be escorted to and from the hospital by a family member or a friend.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02772211"}

Use of the brew has now spread far beyond its original context of consumption to North America, Europe, and Australia in neo-shamanic settings as well as Christian syncretic churches. While these groups have established their own rituals and protocols to guide use, it remains unknown the extent to which the use of traditional or non-traditional practices may affect drinkers' acute experiences, and longer term wellbeing and mental health outcomes. Hence, this study aimed to provide the first detailed assessment of associations between ceremony/ritual characteristics, additional support practices, motivations for drinking, and mental health and wellbeing outcomes. The paper uses data from a large cross-sectional study of ayahuasca drinkers in more than 40 countries who had used ayahuasca in various contexts (n = 6,877). It captured detailed information about participant demographics, patterns and history of ayahuasca drinking, the setting of consumption, and ritualistic practices employed. Current mental health status was captured via the Kessler 10 psychological distress scale and the mental health component score of the SF-12 Health Questionnaire, while reported change in prior clinically diagnosed anxiety or depression (n = 1276) was evaluated using a (PGIC) Patient Global Impression of Change tool. Various intermediate outcomes were also assessed including perceived change in psychological wellbeing, number of personal self-insights attained, and subjective spiritual experience measured via the spirituality dimension of the Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ) and Short Index of Mystical Orientation. Regression models identified a range of significant associations between set and setting variables, and intermediate and final mental health and wellbeing outcomes. A generalized structural equation model (GSEM) was then used to verify relationships and associations between endogenous, mediating and final outcome variables concurrently. The present study sheds new light on the influence of ceremonial practices, additional supports and motivations on the therapeutic effects of ayahuasca for mental health and wellbeing, and ways in which such factors can be optimized in naturalistic settings and clinical studies.", "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.623979", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33967757/", "secondary_title": "Front Pharmacol"}

Here we report a new study examining the relationship between self-reported Ecstasy use and traces of MDMA found in hair samples. Methods: In a laboratory setting, 49 undergraduate volunteers performed an Internet-based assessment which included mood scales and the University of East London Drug Use Questionnaire, which asks for history and current drug use.

Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15\u00b15 mg/70 kg) to high (25 \u00b1 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15\u00b15 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 \u00b1 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions. Despite seeming promising, further research is required before introducing PAP options to mainstream clinical practice. \u00a9 Kaden L. Venugopal.

OBJECTIVE: To explore a theoretical model of delusion formation that implicates prediction error-dependent associative learning processes in a pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging study using the psychotomimetic drug ketamine. DESIGN: Within-subject, randomized, placebo-controlled study. SETTING: Hospital-based clinical research facility, Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, England. The work was completed within the Wellcome Trust and Medical Research Council Behavioral and Clinical Neuroscience Institute, Cambridge. PARTICIPANTS: Fifteen healthy, right-handed volunteers (8 of whom were male) with a mean +/- SD age of 29 +/- 7 years and a mean +/- SD predicted full-scale IQ of 113 +/- 4 were recruited from within the local community by advertisement. INTERVENTIONS: Subjects were given low-dose ketamine (100 ng/mL of plasma) or placebo while performing a causal associative learning task during functional magnetic resonance imaging. In a separate session outside the scanner, the dose was increased (to 200 ng/mL of plasma) and subjects underwent a structured clinical interview. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Brain activation, blood plasma levels of ketamine, and scores from psychiatric ratings scales (Brief Psychiatric Ratings Scale, Present State Examination, and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale). RESULTS: Low-dose ketamine perturbs error-dependent learning activity in the right frontal cortex (P = .03). High-dose ketamine produces perceptual aberrations (P = .01) and delusion-like beliefs (P = .007). Critically, subjects showing the highest degree of frontal activation with placebo show the greatest occurrence of drug-induced perceptual aberrations (P = .03) and ideas or delusions of reference (P = .04). CONCLUSIONS: These findings relate aberrant prediction error-dependent associative learning to referential ideas and delusions via a perturbation of frontal cortical function.

There is a paucity of research concerning the harm reduction practices employed by ecstasy users. This study aimed to explore the prevalence, nature and factors associated with harm reduction practices employed by ecstasy users in Australia, with a specific focus on the practice of preloading and postloading - the use of pharmaceuticals and natural products prior and subsequent to ecstasy use. One hundred and sixteen Australian residents aged 18 years and over who had used ecstasy at least once in their lifetime were recruited via convenience sampling, 'snowballing' and via web-based advertisements and completed an anonymous questionnaire. Participants reported using a wide range of strategies for minimising ecstasy-associated harm. The most common strategies used for reducing negative side effects, 'comedown' or neurotoxicity were drinking water, limiting or reducing ecstasy use, taking breaks and taking vitamins or other natural substances. Forty percent of the sample had tested their ecstasy pills for the presence of MDMA. Forty-one percent and 47% of participants had engaged in pre- and postloading, respectively, with the most common pre- and postloading substances being multivitamins, 5-HTP, magnesium and fruit or fruit juice. Younger mean age and 'high' total occasions of ecstasy use was significantly associated with preloading, and 'high' total use and frequency of use was associated with postloading. The results indicate that ecstasy users are aware of the potential for harm associated with ecstasy use and attempt to minimise harm by actively employing strategies. By exploring the pattern of harm reduction practices among ecstasy users, this study has highlighted the need for further research into the efficacy and potential clinical drug interactions associated with such practices, as well as the need for investigation of how such practices may affect patterns of ecstasy use. \u00a9 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) convened a task force to review the evidence and provide a consensus recommendation for the clinical use of psychedelic treatments for major depressive disorder. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify contemporary clinical trials of serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of major depressive disorder and cancer-related depression. Studies published between January 1990 and July 2021 were identified using combinations of search terms, inspection of bibliographies and review of other psychedelic reviews and consensus statements. The levels of evidence for efficacy were graded according to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments criteria. RESULTS: Only psilocybin and ayahuasca have contemporary clinical trials evaluating antidepressant effects. Two pilot studies showed preliminary positive effects of single-dose ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression (Level 3 evidence). Small randomized controlled trials of psilocybin combined with psychotherapy showed superiority to waitlist controls and comparable efficacy and safety to an active comparator (escitalopram with supportive psychotherapy) in major depressive disorder, with additional randomized controlled trials showing efficacy specifically in cancer-related depression (Level 3 evidence). There was only one open-label trial of psilocybin in treatment-resistant unipolar depression (Level 4 evidence). Small sample sizes and functional unblinding were major limitations in all studies. Adverse events associated with psychedelics, including psychological (e.g., psychotomimetic effects) and physical (e.g., nausea, emesis and headaches) effects, were generally transient. CONCLUSIONS: There is currently only low-level evidence to support the efficacy and safety of psychedelics for major depressive disorder. In Canada, as of 2022, psilocybin remains an experimental option that is only available through clinical trials or the special access program.

Data examined associations between ketamine-related ADEs and various clinical characteristics including chronic pain, depression, or psychiatric disorder, patient physical characteristics, chronic opioid use, perioperative opioid use, dose and duration of ketamine infusions, pain scores, and perioperative medications such as serotonergic agents, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and analgesics. Results: Overall incidence of ketamine-related ADEs was 29.5% and the incidence of psychomimetic effects was 14.8%. We observed that patients with a history of depression have a lower incidence of ketamine-related ADEs compared to patients without a history of depression (10.3% vs 37.3%; p value = 0.007). Conclusion: Patients with depression were found to have a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ketamine-related ADEs.

Background: Novel interventions for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adolescents are urgently needed. Ketamine has been studied in adults with TRD, but little information is available for adolescents. This study investigated efficacy and tolerability of intravenous ketamine in adolescents with TRD, and explored clinical response predictors. Methods: Adolescents, 12\u201318 years of age, with TRD (failure to respond to two previous antidepressant trials) were administered six ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions over 2 weeks. Clinical response was defined as a 50% decrease in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R); remission was CDRS-R score \u2264 28. Tolerability assessment included monitoring vital signs and dissociative symptoms using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Results: Thirteen participants (mean age 16.9 years, range 14.5\u201318.8 years, eight biologically male) completed the protocol. Average decrease in CDRS-R was 42.5% (p = 0.0004). Five (38%) adolescents met criteria for clinical response. Three responders showed sustained remission at 6-week follow-up; relapse occurred within 2 weeks for the other two responders. Ketamine infusions were generally well tolerated; dissociative symptoms and hemodynamic symptoms were transient. Higher dose was a significant predictor of treatment response. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. Limitations include the open-label design and small sample; future research addressing these issues are needed to confirm these results. Additionally, evidence suggested a dose\u2013response relationship; future studies are needed to optimize dose. Finally, questions remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment; more information is needed before broader clinical use.

A valid, direct comparison of the effects of these substances is lacking. The main goal of the present study was to investigate potential pharmacological, physiological and phenomenological differences at psychoactive-equivalent doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The present study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to compare the acute subjective effects, autonomic effects, and pharmacokinetics of typically used, moderate to high doses of mescaline (300 and 500\u2009mg), LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g), and psilocybin (20\u2009mg) in 32 healthy participants. A mescaline dose of 300\u2009mg was used in the first 16 participants and 500\u2009mg was used in the subsequent 16 participants. Acute subjective effects of 500\u2009mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were comparable across various psychometric scales. Autonomic effects of 500\u2009mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were moderate, with psilocybin causing a higher increase in diastolic blood pressure compared with LSD, and LSD showing a trend toward an increase in heart rate compared with psilocybin. The tolerability of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin was comparable, with mescaline at both doses inducing slightly more subacute adverse effects (12-24\u2009h) than LSD and psilocybin. Clear distinctions were seen in the duration of action between the three substances. Mescaline had the longest effect duration (mean: 11.1\u2009h), followed by LSD (mean: 8.2\u2009h), and psilocybin (mean: 4.9\u2009h). Plasma elimination half-lives of mescaline and LSD were similar (approximately 3.5\u2009h). The longer effect duration of mescaline compared with LSD was due to the longer time to reach maximal plasma concentrations and related peak effects. Mescaline and LSD, but not psilocybin, enhanced circulating oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations. In conclusion, the present study found no evidence of qualitative differences in altered states of consciousness that were induced by equally strong doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The results indicate that any differences in the pharmacological profiles of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin do not translate into relevant differences in the subjective experience.

Altered thalamocortical connectivity has been hypothesized to underlie these effects, which is supported by some functional MRI (fMRI) studies. These studies have treated the thalamus as a unitary structure, despite known differential 5-HT2AR expression and functional specificity of different intrathalamic nuclei. Independent Component Analysis (ICA) has been previously used to identify reliable group-level functional subdivisions of the thalamus from resting-state fMRI (rsfMRI) data. We build on these efforts with a novel data-maximizing ICA-based approach to examine psilocybin-induced changes in intrathalamic functional organization and thalamocortical connectivity in individual participants. Methods: Baseline rsfMRI data (n=38) from healthy individuals with a long-term meditation practice was utilized to generate a statistical template of thalamic functional subdivisions. This template was then applied in a novel ICA-based analysis of the acute effects of psilocybin on intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity in follow-up scans from a subset of the same individuals (n=18). We examined correlations with subjective reports of drug effect and compared with a previously reported analytic approach (treating the thalamus as a single functional unit). Results: Several intrathalamic components showed significant psilocybin-induced alterations in spatial organization, with effects of psilocybin largely localized to the mediodorsal and pulvinar nuclei. The magnitude of changes in individual participants correlated with reported subjective effects. These components demonstrated predominant decreases in thalamocortical connectivity, largely with visual and default mode networks. Analysis in which the thalamus is treated as a singular unitary structure showed an overall numerical increase in thalamocortical connectivity, consistent with previous literature using this approach, but this increase did not reach statistical significance. Conclusions: We utilized a novel analytic approach to discover psilocybin-induced changes in intra- and extra-thalamic functional organization and connectivity of intrathalamic nuclei and cortical networks known to express the 5-HT2AR. These changes were not observed using whole-thalamus analyses, suggesting that psilocybin may cause widespread but modest increases in thalamocortical connectivity that are offset by strong focal decreases in functionally relevant intrathalamic nuclei.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2022.119434", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35792293/", "secondary_title": "NeuroImage"}

To date the evidence of acute and persisting effects of psychedelics on immune functioning, HPA axis activity in response to stress, and associated psychological outcomes is preliminary. To address this, we conducted a placebo-controlled, parallel group design comprising of 60 healthy participants who received either placebo (n\u00a0=\u00a030) or 0.17\u00a0mg/kg psilocybin (n\u00a0=\u00a030).

Seven days' post-administration, participants in each treatment group were further subdivided: 15 underwent a stress induction protocol, and 15 underwent a control protocol. Ultra-high field (7-Tesla) magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess whether acute changes in glutamate or glial activity were associated with changes in immune functioning. Finally, questionnaires assessed persisting self-report changes in mood and social behavior. Psilocybin immediately reduced concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), while other inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)- 1\u03b2, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)) remained unchanged. Seven days later, TNF-\u03b1 concentrations returned to baseline, while IL-6 and CRP concentrations were persistently reduced in the psilocybin group. Changes in the immune profile were related to acute neurometabolic activity as acute reductions in TNF-\u03b1 were linked to lower concentrations of glutamate in the hippocampus. Additionally, the more of a reduction in IL-6 and CRP seven days after psilocybin, the more persisting positive mood and social effects participants reported.

Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2\u00a0weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4\u00a0weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or 'self-disclosure' contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.", "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.623985", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33995022/", "secondary_title": "Front Pharmacol"}

However, users of Ecstasy and Molly have increasingly tested positive for novel psychoactive substances (NPS), notably novel stimulants. To evaluate hypothesized non-specific and interchangeable use of the terms Ecstasy, Molly and MDMA, self-reported drug use was compared against toxicological findings in biological specimens. Oral fluid specimens were collected from participants attending large multi-day electronic dance music festivals in Miami, FL; Tampa, FL; and Atlanta, GA.

METHODS: Treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar disorder (BD) (n\u202f=\u202f126) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic (0.5\u202fmg/kg) ketamine infusion.

A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales (derealization, depersonalization, amnesia), and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response. RESULTS: Factor validity was supported, with a root mean square error of approximation of .06, a comparative fit index of .97, and a Tucker-Lewis index of .96. Across all studies and timepoints, the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM-D percent change.

Hence, this study investigated the effects of 24 predictor variables, including age, sex, education, personality traits, drug pre-experience, mental state before drug intake, experimental setting, and drug dose on the acute response to psilocybin. The analysis was based on the pooled data of 23 controlled experimental studies involving 409 psilocybin administrations to 261 healthy volunteers. Multiple linear mixed effects models were fitted for each of 15 response variables. Although drug dose was clearly the most important predictor for all measured response variables, several non-pharmacological variables significantly contributed to the effects of psilocybin. Specifically, having a high score in the personality trait of Absorption, being in an emotionally excitable and active state immediately before drug intake, and having experienced few psychological problems in past weeks were most strongly associated with pleasant and mystical-type experiences, whereas high Emotional Excitability, low age, and an experimental setting involving positron emission tomography most strongly predicted unpleasant and/or anxious reactions to psilocybin.

The current observational, baseline controlled study was designed to assess whether members (n = 24) of the Santo Daime church would show enhanced capacity for mental imagery during an ayahuasca experience. In addition, this study assessed whether the effects of ayahuasca on consciousness and mental imagery were related to peak serum concentration of N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the main psychoactive component. Measures of altered states of consciousness (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire) and ego dissolution (Ego Dissolution Inventory [EDI]) as well as measures of mental imagery (visual perspective shifting, vividness of visual imagery, cognitive flexibility, associative thinking) were taken on two subsequent days on which members of Santo Daime were sober or drank a self-selected volume of ayahuasca. Measures of altered states of consciousness revealed that feelings of oceanic boundlessness, visual restructuralization, and EDI increased most prominently after drinking and shared a positive correlation with peak DMT concentration. Measures of mental imagery did not noticeably differ between the baseline and ayahuasca condition, although subjective ratings of cognitive flexibility were lower under ayahuasca. Two measures related to mental imagery, that is, perspective shifts and cognitive flexibility, were significantly correlated to peak DMT concentrations. Peak concentrations of DMT and other alkaloids did not correlate with ayahuasca dose. These findings confirm previous notions that the primary phenomenological characteristics of ayahuasca are driven by DMT. Compensatory or neuroadaptive effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake may have mitigated the acute impact of ayahuasca in Santo Daime members on mental imagery.", "doi": "10.1162/jocn_a_02003", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37159257/", "secondary_title": "J Cogn Neurosci"}

As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4 mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine\u2019s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

It has recently been shown that acutely applied 3,4-MDMA in fact enhances emotional empathy and prosocial behavior, while it simultaneously decreases cognitive empathy. However, the long-term effects of 3,4-MDMA use on socio-cognitive functions and social interactions have not been investigated yet. Therefore, we examined emotional and cognitive empathy, social decision-making, and oxytocin plasma levels in chronic 3,4-MDMA users. Methods: We tested 38 regular but recently abstinent 3,4-MDMA users and 56 3,4-MDMA-na\u00efve controls with the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition, the Multifaceted Empathy Test, and the Distribution Game and the Dictator Game. Drug use was objectively quantified by 6-month hair analyses. Furthermore, oxytocin plasma levels were determined in smaller subgroups (24 3,4-MDMA users, 9 controls). Results: 3,4-MDMA users showed superior cognitive empathy compared with controls in the Multifaceted Empathy Test (Cohen's d = .39) and in the Movie for the Assessment of Social Cognition (d = .50), but they did not differ from controls in emotional empathy. Moreover, 3,4-MDMA users acted less self-serving in the Distribution Game. However, within 3,4-MDMA users, multiple regression analyses showed that higher 3,4-MDMA concentrations in hair were associated with lower cognitive empathy (\u03b2MDMA = -.34, t = -2.12, P < .05). Oxytocin plasma concentrations did not significantly differ between both groups. Conclusions: We conclude that people with high cognitive empathy abilities and pronounced social motivations might be more prone to 3,4-MDMA consumption.

OBJECTIVES: This work aims to review current evidence regarding the potential contribution of psychedelics and hallucinogens to the discovery of new drugs for treating different psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: Ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin have evidence supporting their use in depression, and psilocybin and ayahuasca have also shown good results in treatment-resistant depression. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with anxious patients, there were symptomatic improvements with psilocybin and LSD. Psilocybin diminished Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in a small obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) sample. The evidence is less robust regarding substance use disorders, but it suggests a possible role for LSD and psilocybin in alcohol use disorders and for psilocybin in tobacco addiction. In a clinical setting, these substances seem to be safe and well-tolerated. Their mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, but there seems to be a preponderant role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 2A agonism, as well as connectivity changes within the default mode network (DMN) and amygdala and some other molecular modifications.

Symptoms of ecstasy dependence that had occurred in the preceding year were determined by an interview using the Kiddie epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The adolescents' psychopathology was examined using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised Scale. The proportion of participants who had symptoms of ecstasy dependence was calculated. The association between the number of symptoms of ecstasy dependence and psychopathology was examined by using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that \"continuing ecstasy use despite knowledge of having a problem related to ecstasy use,\" \"spending a great deal of time in activities related to ecstasy use or to recover from its effects,\" and \"ecstasy use tolerance\" were the 3 most prevalent symptoms of dependence, and \"withdrawal\" was the symptom least reported. Heavy ecstasy use led to more symptoms of ecstasy dependence than light use. Symptoms of ecstasy dependence independently increased the risk of severe psychopathology after controlling the effects of polysubstance use. The results of this study indicated that adolescents were aware of the adverse effects of ecstasy use and that repeated ecstasy use would result in dependence on it.

All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump. Randomization will be performed in blocks, ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine.

Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline, making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection. The active placebo used, midazolam, is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms, that is, it does not worsen and does not treat.

Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-012-2811-0", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22836372/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

There is some evidence of gender differences in the acute, sub-acute and long-term effects of MDMA use, and given that gender differences have been found in aggression, it is possible that men may experience more aggression mid-week than women. The aim of this study was to attempt to replicate findings showing increased bias towards aggressive material in ecstasy users several days after using the drug. In addition, to investigate possible gender differences in mid-week aggression. A total of 46 participants were tested: 19 ecstasy users and 27 controls were compared on the night of drug use and 4 days later. On day 4, a task designed to tap cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content was administered. Participants were required to process sentences that could be interpreted as either aggressive or neutral and subsequently remember them in a recognition test. This data set was then combined with the data from Curran et al.'s (2004) study that employed exactly the same procedure. Thus, the data from 107 participants was analysed to investigate gender differences. Ecstasy users recognized more aggressive sentences than controls and tended to react slower to neutral sentences than controls. Ecstasy users also rated themselves as being more aggressive and depressed than controls on day 4. No gender differences were found on any measure of aggression in the combined data set. Both male and female ecstasy users show a bias toward interpretation of ambiguous material in an aggressive manner when compared to controls 4 days after ecstasy use.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881106060505", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16510487/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

Methods: Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Timeline methods were used to collect information on lifetime and recent ecstasy use, as well as recent other drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Results: Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These results highlight the need to consider the role of environmental factors when examining the relationship between ecstasy use and mood symptoms. Whether ecstasy exacerbates such symptoms in vulnerable individuals requires further investigation using prospective designs. \u00a9 2010 Springer-Verlag.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-009-1763-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20101393/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology"}

Ketamine is thought to exert its antidepressant action by restoring neuroplasticity. In order to test for acute impact of a single ketamine infusion on grey matter volume we performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation in healthy volunteers using VBM. 28 healthy individuals underwent two MRI sessions within a timeframe of 2 weeks, each consisting of two structural T1-weighted MRIs within a single session, one before and one 45 min after infusion of S-ketamine (bolus of 0.11mg/kg, followed by an maintenance infusion of 0.12 mg/kg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl infusion) using a crossover design. In the repeated-measures ANOVA with time (post-infusion/pre-infusion) and medication (placebo/ketamine) as factors, no significant effect of interaction and no effect of medication was found (FWE-corrected). Importantly, further post-hoc t-tests revealed a strong 'decrease' of grey matter both in the placebo and the ketamine condition over time. This effect was evident mainly in frontal and temporal regions bilaterally with t-values ranging from 4.95 to 5.31 (FWE-corrected at p < 0.05 voxel level). The vulnerabilities of VBM have been repeatedly demonstrated, with reports of influence of blood flow, tissue water and direct effects of pharmacological compounds on the MRI signal. Here again, we highlight that the relationship between intervention and VBM results is apparently subject to a number of physiological influences, which are partly unknown. Future studies focusing on the effects of ketamine on grey matter should try to integrate known influential factors such as blood flow into analysis. Furthermore, the results of this study highlight the importance of a carefully performed placebo condition in pharmacological fMRI studies.

Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797. FINDINGS: Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30-60 min after dosing, peaked 2-3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing. Mean self-rated intensity (on a 0-1 scale) was 0\u00b751 (SD 0\u00b736) for the low-dose session and 0\u00b775 (SD 0\u00b727) for the high-dose session. Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients). Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference -11\u00b78, 95% CI -9\u00b715 to -14\u00b735, p=0\u00b7002, Hedges' g=3\u00b71) and 3 months (-9\u00b72, 95% CI -5\u00b769 to -12\u00b771, p=0\u00b7003, Hedges' g=2) after high-dose treatment. Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also noted.
