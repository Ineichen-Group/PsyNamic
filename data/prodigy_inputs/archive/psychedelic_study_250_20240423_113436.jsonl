However, previous studies assessing possible psychopathological effects have not identified whether users consider their ecstasy use 'problematic' or not. In addition, research has generally failed to address the potential role of premorbid psychiatric status. This study aimed to assess whether premorbid psychiatric history and/or patterns of ecstasy use would be associated with the degree of self-reported problems attributable to ecstasy. Problematic ecstasy users (n = 53) who had reported problems attributable to their ecstasy use were compared with non-problematic ecstasy users (n = 62), polydrug controls (n = 62) and illegal drug-naive controls (n = 111) on a recreational drug use questionnaire; a questionnaire, which ascertained personal and family psychiatric histories, and the Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI). Problematic ecstasy users exhibited significantly higher scores on a number of dimensions of the BSI compared to illegal drug-naive and/or polydrug controls. Problematic ecstasy users also exhibited significantly elevated scores on somatization, depression, anxiety and negative psychobiology compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. BSI scores for the non-problematic ecstasy users did not differ from polydrug or illegal drug-naive controls. Problematic ecstasy users reported significantly higher levels of ecstasy use, including lifetime consumption, average dosage and binge consumption compared to non-problematic ecstasy users. Additionally, a greater number of problematic ecstasy users reported personal and family psychiatric histories compared to controls and non-problematic ecstasy users. This study demonstrates two distinct ecstasy using groups: non-problematic ecstasy users who are not showing signs of psychopathology and problematic ecstasy users who are showing evidence of a range of symptoms.

This is an update of the 2015 Cochrane Review for the use of glutamate receptor modulators for depression in bipolar disorder. OBJECTIVES: 1. To assess the effects of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with bipolar disorder. 2. To review the acceptability of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in people with bipolar disorder who are experiencing depressive symptoms. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020. \u00a0We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs comparing ketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with other active psychotropic drugs or saline placebo in adults with bipolar depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently selected studies for inclusion, assessed trial quality and extracted data. Primary outcomes were response rate and adverse events. Secondary outcomes included remission rate, depression severity change scores, suicidality, cognition, quality of life, and dropout rate. The GRADE framework was used to assess the certainty of the evidence. MAIN RESULTS: Ten studies (647 participants) were included in this review (an additional five studies compared to the 2015 review). There were no additional studies added to the comparisons identified in the 2015 Cochrane review on ketamine, memantine and cytidine versus placebo. However, three new comparisons were found: ketamine versus midazolam, N-acetylcysteine versus placebo, and riluzole versus placebo. The glutamate receptor modulators studied were ketamine (three trials), memantine (two), cytidine (one), N-acetylcysteine (three), and riluzole (one). Eight of these studies were placebo-controlled and two-armed. In seven trials the glutamate receptor modulators had been used as add-on drugs to mood stabilisers. Only one trial compared ketamine with an active comparator, midazolam. The treatment period ranged from a single intravenous administration (all ketamine studies), to repeated administration for riluzole, memantine, cytidine, and N-acetylcysteine (with a follow-up of eight weeks, 8 to 12 weeks, 12 weeks, and 16 to 20 weeks, respectively). Six of the studies included sites in the USA, one in Taiwan, one in Denmark, one in Australia, and in one study the location was unclear. All participants had a primary diagnosis of bipolar disorder and were experiencing an acute bipolar depressive episode, diagnosed according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fourth edition (IV) or fourth edition text revision (IV-TR). Among all glutamate receptor modulators included in this review, only ketamine appeared to be more efficacious than placebo 24 hours after infusion for response rate (odds ratio (OR) 11.61, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.25 to 107.74; P = 0.03; participants = 33; studies = 2; I\u00b2 = 0%, low-certainty evidence). Ketamine seemed to be more effective in reducing depression rating scale scores (MD -11.81, 95% CI -20.01 to -3.61; P = 0.005; participants = 32; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence of ketamine's efficacy in producing remission over placebo at 24 hours (OR 5.16, 95% CI 0.51 to 52.30; P = 0.72; participants = 33; studies = 2; I(2) = 0%, very low-certainty evidence). Evidence on response, remission or depression rating scale scores between ketamine and midazolam was uncertain at 24 hours due to very low-certainty evidence (OR 3.20, 95% CI 0.23 to 45.19). In the one trial assessing ketamine and midazolam, there were no dropouts due to adverse effects or for any reason (very low-certainty evidence). Placebo may have been more effective than N-acetylcysteine in reducing depression rating scale scores at three months, although this was based on very low-certainty evidence (MD 1.28, 95% CI 0.24 to 2.31; participants = 58; studies = 2). Very uncertain evidence found no difference in response at three months (OR 0.82, 95% CI 0.32 to 2.14; participants = 69; studies = 2; very low-certainty evidence). No data were available for remission or acceptability. Extremely limited data were available for riluzole vs placebo, finding only very-low certainty evidence of no difference in dropout rates (OR 2.00, 95% CI 0.31 to 12.84; P = 0.46; participants = 19; studies = 1; I(2) = 0%). AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: It is difficult to draw reliable conclusions from this review due to the certainty of the evidence being low to very low, and the relatively small amount of data usable for analysis in bipolar disorder, which is considerably less than the information available for unipolar depression. Nevertheless, we found uncertain evidence in favour of a single intravenous dose of ketamine (as add-on therapy to mood stabilisers) over placebo in terms of response rate up to 24 hours, however ketamine did not show any better efficacy for remission in bipolar depression. Even though ketamine has the potential to have a rapid and transient antidepressant effect, the efficacy of a single intravenous dose may be limited. We did not find conclusive evidence on adverse events with ketamine, and there was insufficient evidence to draw meaningful conclusions for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. However, ketamine's psychotomimetic effects (such as delusions or delirium) may have compromised study blinding in some studies, and so we cannot rule out the potential bias introduced by inadequate blinding procedures. To draw more robust conclusions, further methodologically sound RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine, and to study different methods of sustaining antidepressant response, such as repeated administrations.", "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011611.pub3", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34623633/", "secondary_title": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev"}

Methods: In a randomized, double\u2010blind, crossover trial, 41 patients with chronic PTSD, assessed with the SCID\u2010P and CAPS, were assigned to receive one intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and one infusion of midazolam (0.045 mg/kg), two weeks apart, in randomized counterbalanced order.

Methods: This study included a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study of brain tumors with depression. The subjects received a small dose of ketamine intravenously (0.5mg/kg, 40 minutes) during the operation. The Montgomery\u2010 \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. According to the improvement of depression on the third day after operation, patients were divided into an effective group (MADRS score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 50%) and an ineffective group (MADRS score reduction rate is less than 50%). Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip (850K DNA methylation chip) was used to carry out genomewide methylation of peripheral blood in two groups. The methylation sites with significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05) were compared. According to the difference of methylation beta and the difference score, bioinformatics analysis was carried out using GO analysis and Pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to select chloramine.

Results: A total of 34 subjects using ketamine were included in this study, of who 20 were in the ineffective group and 14 were in the effective group.

No changes in current psychotropic medication or dosage were permitted for 4weeks prior to trial entry and throughout the trial. RESULTS: The subject receiving ketamine, but not those receiving midazolam, presented a marked increase in neural plasticity after the treatment course.

The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5-HT2A receptor activation. However, accumulating evidence suggests that 5-HT1A or an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin. Therefore, we used a double-blind, counterbalanced, within-subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5-HT1A agonist buspirone (20mg p.o.) and the non-hallucinogenic 5-HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine (3mg p.o.) on psilocybin-induced (170 \u00b5g/kg p.o.) psychological effects in two groups (n=19, n=17) of healthy human subjects. Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D-ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization (VR) (p<0.001), which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations. Further, buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness (OB) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level (p=0.062), whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin-induced 5D-ASC main scale scores. The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin-induced effects, presumably via 5-HT1A receptor activation, an interaction between 5-HT1A and 5-HT2A receptors, or both. The data suggest that the modulation of 5-HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases.", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroneuro.2016.01.005", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26875114/", "secondary_title": "Eur Neuropsychopharmacol"}

This study investigated whether changes in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the initial antidepressant effects of ketamine, a high-affinity N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. METHOD: Twenty-three subjects aged 18 to 65 years with DSM-IV major depressive disorder (treatment resistant) participated in this study, which was conducted between October 2006 and May 2008. The subjects were given an open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and rated using various depression scales at baseline and at 40, 80, 120, and 230 minutes postinfusion. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score. BDNF levels were obtained at the same time points as depression rating scale scores. RESULTS: Despite a significant (P <. 001) improvement in MADRS scores after subjects received ketamine treatment, no changes in BDNF levels were observed in subjects after they received ketamine compared to baseline. Also, no association was found between antidepressant response and BDNF levels. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrates that ketamine's rapid initial antidepressant effects are not mediated by BDNF. Further studies are necessary to shed light on the neurobiological basis of these effects.

We recorded 275 channel MEG in two experiments (n = 25 human males) examining the effects of subanesthetic ketamine infusion. MEG power spectra revealed a rich set of significant oscillatory changes compared with placebo sessions, including decreases in occipital, parietal, and anterior cingulate alpha power, increases in medial frontal theta power, and increases in parietal and cingulate cortex high gamma power. Each of these spectral effects demonstrated their own set of temporal dynamics. Dynamic causal modeling of frontoparietal connectivity changes with ketamine indicated a decrease in NMDA and AMPA-mediated frontal-to-parietal connectivity. AMPA-mediated connectivity changes were sustained for up to 50 min after ketamine infusion had ceased, by which time perceptual distortions were absent. The results also indicated a decrease in gain of parietal pyramidal cells, which was correlated with participants\u2019 self-reports of blissful state. Based on these results, we suggest that the antidepressant effects of ketamine may depend on its ability to change the balance of frontoparietal connectivity patterns.

Based on preclinical and clinical studies, we hypothesize that NMDAR antagonism will produce an acute increase in GABA and glutamate plus glutamine (Glx) as an early event in antidepressant action. Using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), we found acute ketamine treatment in depressed patients produced rapid, transient elevations (approximately 40%) of both Glx and GABA levels in the medial prefrontal cortex, suggesting that this is an initial step in the antidepressant action cascade for NMDAR antagonists. We used the same methods to assess the effects of high-dose D-cycloserine (1000 mg), an NMDAR glycine site partial agonist, on brain GABA and Glx in healthy subjects. Compared with ketamine, D-cycloserine has a slower (onset within 2\u20134 weeks) but comparable antidepressant effect.

In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). In line with previous reports, we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness (OBN) (sharing features with mystical-type experience) and Dread of Ego Dissolution (DED) (similar to anxiety) would predict long-term positive outcomes, whereas sensory perceptual effects would have negligible predictive value. Materials and Methods: Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin (two separate sessions: 10 and 25 mg psilocybin). The Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session. From the ASC, the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical-type and challenging experiences, respectively. The Self-Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure, as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments, thus confounding inferences. In a repeated measure ANOVA, Time was the within-subject factor (independent variable), with QIDS-SR as the within-subject dependent variable in baseline, 1-day, 1-week, 5-weeks. OBN and DED were independent variables. OBN-by-Time and DED-by-Time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest. Results: For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time (QIDS-SR as dependent variable), the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant (p = 0.002 and p = 0.003, respectively, for main effects), confirming our main hypothesis. Furthermore, Pearson's correlation of OBN with QIDS-SR (5 weeks) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC (p < 0.05). Discussion: This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long-term changes in mental health. Future therapeutic work with psychedelics should recognize the essential importance of quality of experience in determining treatment efficacy and consider ways of enhancing mystical-type experiences and reducing anxiety.

Furthermore, current pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments for PTSD are difficult to tolerate and limited in efficacy, especially in the US Military Veteran (USMV) population. This open-label pilot study will examine the safety and efficacy of two psilocybin administration sessions (15 mg and 25 mg), combined with psychotherapy, among USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will recruit 15 USMVs with severe, treatment resistant PTSD. Participants will receive one low dose (15 mg) and one moderate/high dose (25 mg) of psilocybin in conjunction with preparatory and post-psilocybin therapy sessions. The primary safety outcome will be the type, severity and frequency of adverse events and suicidal ideation/behaviour, as measured by the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. The primary outcome measure for PTSD will be the Clinician Administered PTSD Scale-5. The primary endpoint will be 1 month following the second psilocybin administration session, and the total follow-up time will be 6 months.

There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of LSD, and its endocrine effects are unknown. In animals, LSD disrupts prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and patients with schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI. However, no data are available on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD (200 \u03bcg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men). Outcome measures included psychometric scales; investigator ratings; PPI of the acoustic startle response; and autonomic, endocrine, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena. Subjective well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by LSD. Compared with placebo, LSD decreased PPI. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine. Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided within 72 hours. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to marked hallucinogenic effects, LSD exerts methylenedioxymethamphetamine-like empathogenic mood effects that may be useful in psychotherapy. LSD altered sensorimotor gating in a human model of psychosis, supporting the use of LSD in translational psychiatric research. In a controlled clinical setting, LSD can be used safely, but it produces significant sympathomimetic stimulation.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.11.015", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25575620/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry"}

METHODS: Ninety individuals with severe PTSD received treatment in a double-blind, placebo-controlled pivotal trial of MDMA-AT. In addition to the primary (Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale) and secondary (Sheehan Disability Scale) outcome measures, the Eating Attitudes Test 26 (EAT-26) was administered for pre-specified exploratory purposes at baseline and at study termination. RESULTS: The study sample consisted of 58 females (placebo\u00a0=\u00a031, MDMA\u00a0=\u00a027) and 31 males (placebo\u00a0=\u00a012, MDMA\u00a0=\u00a019) (n\u00a0=\u00a089). Seven participants discontinued prior to study termination. At baseline, 13 (15%) of the 89 individuals with PTSD had total EAT-26 scores in the clinical range (\u226520), and 28 (31.5%) had total EAT-26 scores in the high-risk range (\u226511) despite the absence of active purging or low weight. In completers (n\u00a0=\u00a082), there was a significant reduction in total EAT-26 scores in the total group of PTSD participants following MDMA-AT versus placebo (p\u00a0=\u00a0.03).

From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short\u2010term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO\u2010Five Factor Inventory (NEO\u2010FFI), Symptom Checklist\u201090 item (SCL\u201090), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2\u2010hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18\u201035 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D\u2010Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D\u2010ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019. Four strata were populated, (males 18\u201035) n = 24; (males 35+) n = 24; (females 18\u201035) n = 23; (females 35+) n = 18. 38% of the participants had prior psilocybin experience. A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed, with up to 6 participants per session (2 sessions with 1 participant, 3 with 2 participants, 5 with 3 participants, 11 with 4, 2 with 5, and, 2 ith 6). In the simultaneous administration sessions, each participant was supported by an assisting therapist, overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist. During this study, 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies. Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences. The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists.

At subanesthetic doses, it safely and reversibly causes delusion-like ideas, amotivation and perceptual disruptions reminiscent of the aberrant salience experiences that characterize first-episode psychosis. However, auditory verbal hallucinations, a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia, have not been reported consistently in healthy volunteers even at high doses of ketamine. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Here we present data from a set of healthy participants who received moderately dosed, placebo-controlled ketamine infusions in the reduced stimulation environment of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. We highlight the phenomenological experiences of 3 participants who experienced particularly vivid hallucinations. RESULTS: Participants in this series reported auditory verbal and musical hallucinations at a ketamine dose that does not induce auditory hallucination outside of the scanner. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret the observation of ketamine-induced auditory verbal hallucinations in the context of the reduced perceptual environment of the MRI scanner and offer an explanation grounded in predictive coding models of perception and psychosis - the brain fills in expected perceptual inputs, and it does so more in situations of altered perceptual input. The altered perceptual input of the MRI scanner creates a mismatch between top-down perceptual expectations and the heightened bottom-up signals induced by ketamine. Such circumstances induce aberrant percepts, including musical and auditory verbal hallucinations. We suggest that these circumstances might represent a useful experimental model of auditory verbal hallucinations and highlight the impact of ambient sensory stimuli on psychopathology.", "doi": "10.1159/000438675", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26361209/", "secondary_title": "Psychopathology"}

The emergence of rapid-acting antidepressants in psychiatry provides the impetus for outcome measures that have been validated as sensitive to change with rapid-acting treatments. Herein, we provide results validating the McIntyre and Rosenblat Rapid Response Scale (MARRRS). METHODS: Adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) receiving intravenous (IV) ketamine had depressive symptoms measured with the 16-Item Quick Inventory Depressive Symptoms Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16) and MARRRS at baseline and as a repeated measure across an acute course of four infusions. The MARRRS is a self-report measure assessing depressive symptoms during the past 72 hours. RESULTS: Sixty-four patients (M(age)\u00a0=\u00a045.4 \u00b1 13.5) were included. The MARRRS had a high internal consistency across acute infusions as determined by Cronbach's alpha (0.84 to 0.94). There was significant convergent validity between the QIDS-SR-16 and MARRRS total scores across infusions (rs(292)\u00a0=\u00a0.87, p < .001); the MARRRS was also sensitive to change (rs(49)\u00a0=\u00a0.70, p < .001). Exploratory factor analysis revealed that MARRRS items loaded onto two factors (i.e., dysphoria and psychic anxiety) accounting for 63.4% of the total variance. LIMITATIONS: Heterogenous sample of adults with TRD receiving open-label treatment without placebo comparison. CONCLUSION: The MARRRS is a brief validated self-report metric of depression symptom severity that is sensitive to change with the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine. Measuring outcomes with the MARRRS informs treatment progress and facilitates treatment decisions in persons receiving the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine.

This controlled study aimed to analyse the predictive and discriminative power of heart rate (HR) and heart rate variability (HRV) for ketamine treatment in MDD. METHODS: In 51 patients, HR and HRV were assessed at baseline before and during ketamine infusion and 24 hours post ketamine infusion. Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess changes of depressive symptoms. A 30% or 50% reduction of symptoms after 24 hours or within 7\u00a0days was defined as response. A linear mixed model was used for analysis.

Responders to ketamine showed a higher HR during the whole course of investigation, including at baseline with medium effect sizes (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a00.47-0.67). Furthermore, HR and HRV power discriminated between responders and non-responders, while normalized low and high frequencies did not. CONCLUSION: The findings show a predictive value of HR and HRV power for ketamine treatment.

First, there are indications that psychedelicassisted therapies might be effective in improving success rates in the treatment of substance use disorders. It is hypothesised that the mechanism of action might involve mystical states that have been shown to be reliably produced in an RCT of psilocybin; the personal significance of these effects was maintained at 14 month follow up, including positive changes in personality.

The present investigation compares self-reports of psychobiological difficulties among ecstasy users recruited either via a bulletin board or by alternative methods. Qualitative data included reports of any negative or positive changes attributable to ecstasy use and reasons for cessation of use. An Internet-based design was utilized and 209 volunteers completed the study, 117 of whom were recruited via a bulletin board devoted to discussion of ecstasy. Psychobiological difficulties attributable to ecstasy use varied, with mood fluctuation the most common. Differences between the two groups in the extent to which these problems were reported was found. Bulletin board recruits were less likely to report anxiety or poor concentration, but more likely to report tremors/twitches. For the whole sample, lifetime use was associated more with psychobiologial problems, although this pattern was stronger and more pervasive for the non-bulletin board participants. Bulletin board recruits were more aware of possible negative psychological effects and were more likely to report adopting harm reduction strategies. From the qualitative data three negative consequences of use were identified, the most common of which was 'psychological problems'. In support of the quantitative findings the likelihood of reporting psychological problems increased with lifetime exposure to ecstasy in both recruitment conditions but interestingly this did not appear to impact on reasons for cessation of use.

In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-na\u00efve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. \u00a9 2006 Springer-Verlag.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-005-0256-4", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16425060/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology"}

The proposed mechanism of antidepressant effects of ketamine is a glutamatergic surge, which can be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma oscillations. Yet, non-linear EEG biomarkers of ketamine effects such as neural complexity are needed to capture broader systemic effects, represent the level of organization of synaptic communication, and elucidate mechanisms of action for treatment responders. In a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial, we investigated two EEG neural complexity markers (Lempel-Ziv complexity [LZC] and multiscale entropy [MSE]) of rapid (baseline to 240\u2009min) and post-rapid ketamine (24\u2009h and 7 days) effects after one 40-min infusion of IV ketamine or midazolam (active control) in 33 military veterans with LL-TRD. We also studied the relationship between complexity and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score change at 7 days post-infusion. We found that LZC and MSE both increased 30\u2009min post-infusion, with effects not localized to a single timescale for MSE. Post-rapid effects of reduced complexity with ketamine were observed for MSE. No relationship was observed between complexity and reduction in depressive symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that a single sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion has time-varying effects on system-wide contributions to the evoked glutamatergic surge in LL-TRD. Further, changes to complexity were observable outside the time-window previously shown for effects on gamma oscillations.

This study investigates the association between moderate use and cognition in a population-based sample. Methods: A total of 284 young adults with ecstasy, cannabis or alcohol use and a control group were sampled from the EDSP database for participation in the Munich Assessment of Young Adults (MAYA) study. Subjects completed a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests (executive functions, working memory and impulsivity). Multiple linear regression models were conducted to examine the relationship between use and cognitive performance. Results: Increased ecstasy consumption was associated with increased error-proneness (Stroop task, CANTAB ID/ED-shift, spatial working memory). More frequent cannabis use and more extensive alcohol consumption were associated with a higher degree of impulsiveness. Conclusions: Based on mild to moderate SU, little indication of differences in executive functioning was found. For ecstasy use, an increased error-proneness was revealed.

High-density 62-channel EEG was used to record spontaneous brain activity and responses evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in 10 healthy volunteers before and during administration of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine in an open-label within-subject design. Evoked signal diversity was assessed using the perturbational complexity index (PCI), calculated from EEG responses to TMS perturbations. Signal diversity of spontaneous EEG, with eyes open and eyes closed, was assessed by Lempel Ziv complexity (LZc), amplitude coalition entropy (ACE), and synchrony coalition entropy (SCE). Although no significant difference was found in TMS-evoked complexity (PCI) between the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition and normal wakefulness, all measures of spontaneous EEG signal diversity (LZc, ACE, SCE) showed significantly increased values in the sub-anaesthetic ketamine condition. This increase in signal diversity correlated with subjective assessment of altered states of consciousness. Moreover, spontaneous signal diversity was significantly higher when participants had eyes open compared to eyes closed, both during normal wakefulness and during influence of sub-anaesthetic ketamine. The results suggest that PCI and spontaneous signal diversity may reflect distinct, complementary aspects of changes in brain properties related to altered states of consciousness: the brain's capacity for information integration, assessed by PCI, might be indicative of the brain's ability to sustain consciousness, while spontaneous complexity, as measured by EEG signal diversity, may be indicative of the complexity of conscious content.

However, there is inconsistency across studies investigating the effect of ketamine for chronic pain management. We aimed to perform a meta-analysis in order to assess the efficacy of this compound during chronic non-cancer pain conditions. METHODS: The study consisted in a meta-analysis of clinical trials comparing ketamine to a placebo during chronic non-cancer pain. The primary endpoint of this study was pain relief 4\u00a0weeks after the beginning of treatment. Secondary outcomes were: pain relief 1, 2, 8 and 12\u00a0weeks after the beginning of treatment and incidence of psychedelic manifestations. RESULTS: Six studies were included in this meta-analysis. Overall, 99 patients received ketamine and 96 received placebo. Ketamine did not decrease pain intensity at 4\u00a0weeks (MD (on a 0 to 10 scale)\u00a0=\u00a0-1.12 [-2.33, 0.09], GRADE evidence: very low). However, analysing studies with no high-risk bias found ketamine to decrease pain intensity at 4\u00a0weeks and increased the level of GRADE evidence to moderate. Trial sequential analysis confirmed the overall result and revealed the lack of power of this meta-analysis. Ketamine also decreased pain intensity at all other evaluated points in time. Ketamine increased the incidence of psychedelic manifestations in comparison to placebo. CONCLUSION: Results of this meta-analysis found moderate evidence suggesting the efficacy of ketamine during chronic pain. Further studies are warranted to conclude about the effect of ketamine during chronic pain conditions and to determine optimal administration regimes of this agent during this condition. SIGNIFICANCE: Ketamine has been found interesting for managing chronic pain. We performed a meta-analysis aiming to confirm those results.

Methods: In 2 long-term, phase 3 studies (NCT02493868, October 1, 2015-February 16, 2018; NCT02497287, September 30, 2015-October 28, 2017), patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (per DSM-5) and nonresponse to\u2009\u2265\u20092 oral antidepressants received esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg) twice weekly during a 4-week induction phase, weekly for weeks 5-8, and weekly or every 2 weeks thereafter as maintenance treatment, in conjunction with a new oral antidepressant. A post hoc analysis using descriptive statistics evaluated occurrence (incidence, frequency, severity) and recurrence (incidence and severity) of events of specific interest. Results: In patients treated with esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant (n\u2009=\u2009928), spontaneously reported adverse events of dizziness, nausea, sedation, vertigo, and increased blood pressure were more likely to recur after the first week of treatment if they occurred more frequently (twice\u2009>\u2009once\u2009>\u2009none) during the first week. The same pattern was observed when these events were assessed by structured instruments. Incidences of dizziness, dissociation, increased blood pressure, nausea, vertigo, and sedation were highest in week 1 of treatment (20.6%, 16.7%, 4.3%, 14.0%, 12.1%, and 3.8%, respectively) and decreased thereafter. Initial occurrences and subsequent recurrences of events were mostly mild or moderate in severity. Conclusions: Adverse events during treatment with esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant generally become less frequent with ongoing treatment, and the majority are mild or moderate in severity.

Ketamine, a phencyclidine hydrochloride derivative, is a dissociative anesthetic and a noncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate subtype of excitatory amino acid receptor. METHODS: Nineteen healthy subjects recruited by advertisements from the community participated in this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Subjects completed three test days involving the 40-minute intravenous administration of placebo, ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg), or ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg). Behaviors associated with the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia were assessed by using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Changes in perception and behaviors associated with dissociative states were assessed by the Perceptual Aberration Subscale of the Wisconsin Psychosis Proneness Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. Cognitive function was assessed by using the (1) Mini-Mental State Examination; (2) tests sensitive to frontal cortical dysfunction, including a continuous performance vigilance task, a verbal fluency task, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; and (3) tests of immediate and delayed recall. Plasma levels of cortisol, prolactin, homovanillic acid, and 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol were measured. RESULTS: Ketamine (1) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia; (2) elicited alterations in perception; (3) impaired performance on tests of vigilance, verbal fluency, and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test; (4) evoked symptoms similar to dissociative states; and (5) preferentially disrupted delayed word recall, sparing immediate recall and postdistraction recall. Ketamine had no significant effect on the Mini-Mental State Examination at the doses studied. Ketamine also had no effect on plasma 3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenethyleneglycol levels, although it blunted a test day decline in plasma homovanillic acid levels at the higher dose. It also dose dependently increased plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Ketamine produced small dose-dependent increases in blood pressure.

Aims: To evaluate the effects of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on driving performance in unipolar major depressive disorder (MDD) or persistent depressive disorder (PDD) patients. Methods: The study consisted of two parts. Part A was a single-blind, double-dummy, randomized three-period, cross-over study to compare effects of esketamine versus placebo on next morning driving, 18 \u00b1 2 h post-treatment. Alcohol was administered to demonstrate assay sensitivity. In Part B, same-day driving, 6 \u00b1 0.5 hours post-treatment, was assessed during twice weekly esketamine administration for 3 weeks.

METHOD: This randomized, double-blind clinical trial included inpatients, with major depressive disorder, undergoing ECT. Subjects were randomly allocated to receive either ketamine or thiopental. Mini-Mental State Examination and Hamilton Depression Rating Scale were used to assess memory and depression, respectively, before the first and second ECT sessions as well as a few days and 1 month after the sixth session. The electrical charge, seizure duration, blood pressure, and heart rate were also recorded. RESULTS: Of the 31 patients, 17 met the criteria for the ketamine group but 2 dropped out of the study. Therefore, 15 patients received ketamine and 14 received thiopental. Each patient underwent 6 ECT sessions. At the end of the study, depression improved significantly in both groups. However, a significant difference in depression improvement was noted only before the second ECT with ketamine compared with thiopental. Despite a significant decline in Mini-Mental State Examination scores in both groups after the first ECT, cognitive function improved afterward but was only significant in ketamine group. Seizure duration was found to be significantly longer with ketamine. Stimulus intensity used for each ECT increased gradually and linearly with a greater increase observed in thiopental group.

Psilocybin's effects on cognitive function have not been widely or systematically studied. AIM: The aim of this study was to explore the safety of simultaneous administration of psilocybin to healthy participants in the largest randomised controlled trial of psilocybin to date. Primary and secondary endpoints assessed the short- and longer-term change in cognitive functioning, as assessed by a Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) Panel, and emotional processing scales. Safety was assessed via endpoints which included cognitive function, assessed by CANTAB global composite score, and treatment-emergent adverse event (TEAE) monitoring. METHODS: In this phase 1, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, healthy participants (n\u2009=\u200989; mean age 36.1\u2009years; 41 females, 48 males) were randomised to receive a single oral dose of 10 or 25\u2009mg psilocybin, or placebo, administered simultaneously to up to six participants, with one-to-one psychological support - each participant having an assigned, dedicated therapist available throughout the session. RESULTS: In total, 511 TEAEs were reported, with a median duration of 1.0\u2009day; 67% of all TEAEs started and resolved on the day of administration.

DESIGN: Systematic review and meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: We searched PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Clinical Trials, and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews for relevant studies published since database inception and December 17, 2019.

{"record_id": 6066, "keywords": "['Depression', 'Depressive Disorder', 'Ketamine', 'Midazolam']", "text": "Ketamine for Depression Relapse Prevention Following ECT.^\nDESIGN: This pilot trial has two phases. Phase 1 is a prospective open study that involves recruiting a cohort of patients with major depressive disorder (DSM\u2010IV criteria) referred for ECT. Patients subsequently identified as being responders will be invited to participate in Phase 2, which is a two\u2010group parallel\u2010design randomised controlled pilot trial. Consented ECT\u2010responders will be randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a four\u2010week course of either once\u2010weekly ketamine or midazolam infusions, continuing regular care. Participants will be followed\u2010up over six\u2010months following ECT to identify if and when relapse occurs. RANDOMISATION AND BLINDING: In Phase 2, ECT responders will be randomised after baseline data collection. Patients and raters will be blind to treatment allocation. The anaesthetist administering ketamine/midazolam infusions will not be blinded but will not be involved in assessments or data analysis. Computerised random allocation, using randomly permuted blocks, will be done independently. PARTICIPANTS: Inclusion criteria: Patients \u226518 years with unipolar major depressive disorder (DSM\u2010IV), a 24\u2010item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD\u201024) score of \u226521, and referred for ECT will be invited to participate in the open Phase 1. Patients will have a physical examination, routine haematology and biochemistry investigations, and an ECG to screen for any medical conditions that might affect ability to be treated with ECT or ketamine. For the randomised Phase 2, patients must have (i) received a substantial course of ECT in Phase 1 (i.e. at least five sessions), (ii) achieved at least response criteria (i.e. \u226560% decrease from baseline HRSD\u201024 score and score \u226416 on two consecutive weekly ratings), (iii) have a nominated adult who can stay with them for 24\u2010hours on out\u2010patient treatment days, (iv) have a Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) score of \u226524, and (v) be able to provide informed consent. Patients will continue on regular psychotropic and other medications as prescribed by their consultant psychiatrist. This reflects the conditions under which adjunctive ketamine would be used in routine clinical practice, thereby enhancing the generalisability and external validity of a future definitive trial. Exclusion criteria are: any condition rendering patients medically unfit for general anaesthesia, ECT or ketamine; active suicidal intention; dementia; lifetime history of bipolar disorder, post traumatic stress disorder, or other Axis 1 diagnosis; ECT in the previous six\u2010months; alcohol/substance abuse in previous six\u2010months; pregnancy; inability/refusal to consent. Patients will be given verbal and full written information and be asked to provide written informed consent. INTERVENTIONS: Please see description OUTCOMES Process outcomes The focus of a pilot trial's outcomes is on trial process with assessment of the primary clinical outcome being secondary because the pilot itself is not designed to measure efficacy. Process outcomes that will inform a future definitive ketamine relapse prevention trial include information on the following: \u2010 recruitment methods and rate \u2010 willingness of participants to be randomised \u2010 willingness of participants to complete assessments \u2010 randomisation \u2010 success of blinding \u2010 ability to administer a course of ketamine infusions \u2010 medical safety and acceptability of ketamine infusions in an ECT responder population \u2010 rates of adverse dissociative and psychiatric events \u2010 adherence to allocated treatment \u2010 adherence to follow\u2010up \u2010 reasons for drop\u2010out from treatment \u2010 reasons for drop\u2010out from follow\u2010up \u2010 a 95% confidence interval for the difference between the ketamine and midazolam groups in six\u2010month relapse rates to help with power calculations for a future definitive trial Clinical outcomes: The following will be used to obtain baseline, intra\u2010treatment, end\u2010of\u2010treatment and follow\u2010up data. Most are standard measures used by ourselves and others in depression, ECT or keta ine studies. Raters will be trained on all measures before recruitment begins. (i) Diagnosis and treatment history: Diagnosis of major depressive disorder will be confirmed using the mood episodes module of the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM\u2010IV Axis I Disorders (SCID). The Columbia Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATHF) will be used to obtain index episode treatment details and provide measures of treatment\u2010resistance. Handedness will be recorded with the Edinburgh Handedness Questionnaire. The National Adult Reading Test (NART) will measure premorbid ability. Additional baseline data from patient interview and case\u2010note review will include age, sex, weight, height, occupation, educational attainment, duration of index depressive episode, number of previous depressive episodes, previous ECT, history of medical illness and surgical treatments, personal and family history of alcohol/substance dependency, presence of psychotic symptoms (detected by SCID), and current medications and other therapies. Changes in medications during Phases 1 and 2 will be documented at follow\u2010up interviews. (ii) Depression outcomes: The primary clinical outcome measure is the relapse rate at six months as measured using the objectively\u2010rated 24\u2010item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD\u201024). To enter Phase 1 patients must score \u226521. Response to ECT is defined as achieving \u226560% decrease from baseline HRSD\u201024 and score \u226416 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Remission criteria are \u226560% decrease in HRSD from baseline and score \u226410 on two consecutive weekly ratings. Criteria for relapse are \u226510 point increase in HRSD\u201024 compared to baseline Phase 2 score plus HRSD \u226516; in addition, increase in the HRSD should be maintained one week later (if indicated, additional follow\u2010ups will be arranged). Hospital admission, further ECT, and deliberate self\u2010harm/suicide also constitute relapse. Timing of these events will be recorded. Patients must achieve at least response to participate in the Phase 2 pilot trial. Baseline and weekly intra\u2010treatment course HRSD\u201024 scores will be obtained during the treatment periods of Phases 1 and 2. During the infusion sessions in Phase 2 HRSD\u201024 scores will be obtained 60 minutes before the infusion begins and at +120 and +240 minutes afterwards. Baseline scores on sleep and appetite items will be maintained for repeated measures within one day. The +240 HRSD\u201024 scores will serve as the weekly post\u2010ECT scores up to follow\u2010up\u2010week 4. Depression measures will be repeated at weeks 6, 8, 12, 20 and 26 during the six\u2010month follow\u2010up. Subjective mood ratings will be measured at the above timepoints using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms, self\u2010report version (QIDS\u2010SR16). 1. Global cognition will be assessed with the revised Addenbrooke's Cognitive Examination (ACE\u2010R; three parallel versions) which also generates Mini\u2010Mental State Examination (MMSE) and verbal fluency scores. The ACE\u2010R provides a total score (maximum=100) plus subscale scores for different aspects of cognition and has been used to study cognition in depression and by ourselves during ECT. 2. Forward and Backward Digit Spans \u2010 immediate short\u2010term memory, attention and working memory 3. Trail Making Test (Part A) \u2010 motor and psychomotor speed 4. Frontal\u2010executive function will be rated by Trail Making Test (Part B) plus letter and category verbal fluencies. 5. Anterograde verbal memory will be tested using the Free and Cued Selective Reminding Test variant (immediate and delayed recall) of the Buschke Selective Reminding Test. (iii) Cognitive outcomes: Cognitive testing can be challenging for severely depressed patients. It is vital that patients be encouraged to remain in the trial throughout the whole study period and a great deal of tact is required of raters. Priority will be given to obtaining scores on the HRSD\u201024. In a recent meta\u2010analysis we identified that ECT has the most pronounced subacute (i.e. 0\u20103 days post course) adverse effects upon verbal memor (delayed word list recall) and frontal executive function. Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine can cause problems with orientation, concentration, working and episodic memory but these resolve within two hours of beginning an infusion. There are no published data on effects of ketamine on cognition in ECT responders. We will use the following battery in Phase 1 (pre and post ECT course; the latter will serve as baseline for Phase 2) and Phase 2 (one day after the first and fourth infusions and at six\u2010months). Parallel versions will be used to reduce practice effects. 6. To measure retrograde amnesia for autobiographical information we will use the Kopelman Autobiographical Memory Interview (K\u2010AMI), The K\u2010AMI will be administered pre and post ECT, after the fourth ketamine infusion, and at six months. (iv) Ketamine psychotomimetic effects and adverse events: Acute psychotomimetic effects of ketamine are usually short\u2010lived and restricted to the infusion period, resolving within one hour. They include dissociative and psychiatric symptoms. In line with previous ketamine trials we will measure dissociative effects with the Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS), psychotomimetic effects with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS; four\u2010item positive symptom subscale), and mood elevation with the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS; mood item). These effects will be measured before, during (+35\u201040 mins) and after (+240 mins) the ketamine infusions. The Patient\u2010Rated Inventory of Side Effects will be used to document other general adverse events by patients at the same time points. All adverse medical, psychotomimetic and general events will be reported to the Trial Steering and Data Monitoring Committees. STATISTICAL METHODS A formal sample size calculation is not appropriate for this pilot trial. Pilot trial data will be analysed on an intention\u2010to\u2010treat basis for all patients who completed at least one infusion. Data analyses will be performed blinded to allocation.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02414932"}

Here, we for the first time conduct a study that assesses psilocybin effects on cerebral 5-HT2AR binding with [(11)C]Cimbi-36 positron emission tomography (PET) imaging and on personality and mindfulness. Ten healthy and psychedelic-na\u00efve volunteers underwent PET neuroimaging of 5-HT2AR at baseline (BL) and one week (1W) after a single oral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3\u00a0mg/kg). Personality (NEO PI-R) and mindfulness (MAAS) questionnaires were completed at BL and at three-months follow-up (3M). Paired t-tests revealed statistically significant increases in personality Openness (p(uncorrected)\u00a0=\u00a00.04, mean change [95%CI]: 4.2[0.4;\u221e]), which was hypothesized a priori to increase, and mindfulness (p(FWER)\u00a0=\u00a00.02, mean change [95%CI]: 0.5 [0.2;0.7]).

Aims: The aim of this study was to assess non-causal associations between MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelic use and psychological distress and suicide risk. Methods: In this study, we examined the aforementioned associations among 484,732 adult participants in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2008\u20132019).

The burden of MDD is staggering, considered by the World Health Organization to be the leading cause of disability in developed countries for people aged 15\u201044. Oral antidepressant therapy for MDD is notoriously ineffective. At least 3 weeks of treatment is usually required to achieve response rates that rarely exceed 40% (only 10% better than placebo); furthermore, treatment can be complicated by serious side effects serious (e.g. falls, weight gain) including increased suicidality. Up to 15% of patients will eventually be diagnosed as having treatment\u2010resistant depressions (TRD), defined as the failure to respond to at least two antidepressants from different pharmacologic classes after adequate treatment duration at therapeutic dosages. The gold standard therapy for TRD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) with general anaesthesia (GA), which produces rapid antidepressant effects after only a few sessions. Propofol is the traditional anaesthetic agent used in GA for ECT, although recently this research group showed that ECT with ketamine as the primary anaesthetic produced faster depression remission compared to ECT with propofol. Despite its efficacy, ECT is associated with considerable problems. More than 10% of patients will experience amnesia and confusion, which can persist for weeks. These cognitive side effects limit the frequency of ECT treatments to two or three times per week. There is also a risk of rare but devastating cardiorespiratory adverse events, at least part of which can be attributed to the need to induce chemical paralysis (for safety) and administer opioids (for pain control) during ECT with GA. Lastly, ECT requires specialized psychiatric expertise, dedicated resources, specially trained nurses, and an anaesthesiologist \u2010 requirements that are both costly and not readily available in many settings. In contrast to ECT, daily short\u2010acting anaesthesia, including ketamine, is well tolerated. A recent study found that only three treatments of intravenous ketamine produced a greater early improvement in depression scores compared to ECT under non\u2010ketamine\u2010based GA. This suggests a possibility of achieving early disease remission in TRD with ketamine\u2010only infusions while avoiding the safety risks and treatment delays associated with ECT under GA. The efficacy, feasibility, and improved side\u2010effect profile of frequent successive ketamine treatments suggest it may be the preferred treatment for TRD compared to ECT with ketamine\u2010based GA. There may, however, be a small subgroup of TRD patients who do not respond to ketamine alone and require ECT, although with a daily treatment regimen, ketamine non\u2010responders could be quickly identified and given a standard course of ECT. The researchers propose that a treatment protocol of daily High Intensity Ketamine with ECT Rescue (HIKER) will be superior to ECT Therapy with ketamine anesthesia standard therapy (EAST) in facilitating early disease remission, while at the same time yielding similar overall remission rates by allowing ketamine non\u2010responders to be quickly identified and given ECT.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT03272698"}

Acute MDMA treatment produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction associated with MDMA plasma concentrations.

The decrease in CD4 T-cell counts and in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation was dose-dependent. The correlation between MDMA pharmacokinetics and the profile of MDMA-induced immune dysfunction suggests that alteration of the immune system may be mediated by the central nervous system.

Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for various conditions, including end-of-life anxiety, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and smoking and alcohol dependence, with promising preliminary results. Here, we aimed to investigate the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with unipolar treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: In this open-label feasibility trial, 12 patients (six men, six women) with moderate-to-severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after each session. The primary outcome measure for feasibility was patient-reported intensity of psilocybin's effects. Patients were monitored for adverse reactions during the dosing sessions and subsequent clinic and remote follow-up. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months after treatment, with the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS) serving as the primary efficacy outcome. This trial is registered with ISRCTN, number ISRCTN14426797. FINDINGS: Psilocybin's acute psychedelic effects typically became detectable 30-60 min after dosing, peaked 2-3 h after dosing, and subsided to negligible levels at least 6 h after dosing.

Psilocybin was well tolerated by all of the patients, and no serious or unexpected adverse events occurred. The adverse reactions we noted were transient anxiety during drug onset (all patients), transient confusion or thought disorder (nine patients), mild and transient nausea (four patients), and transient headache (four patients).

The aim of the present study was to determine whether or not ketamine administration significantly improves depressive symptomatology in depression and more specifically in major depressive disorder (MDD), bipolar depression, resistant depression (non-ECT studies), and as an anesthetic agent in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) for resistant depression (ECT studies). Secondary outcomes were the duration of ketamine's effect, the efficacy on suicidal ideations, the existence of a dose effect, and the safety/tolerance of the treatment. METHODS: Studies were included if they met the following criteria (without any language or date restriction): design: randomized controlled trials, intervention: ketamine administration, participants: diagnosis of depression, and evaluation of severity based on a validated scale. We calculated standardized mean differences (SMDs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) for each study. We used fixed and random effects models. Heterogeneity was assessed using the I2 statistic. RESULTS: We included nine non-ECT studies in our quantitative analysis (192 patients with major depressive disorder and 34 patients with bipolar depression). Overall, depression scores were significantly decreased in the ketamine groups compared to those in the control groups (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.99; 95 % CI -1.23, -0.75; p\u2009<\u20090.01). Ketamine's efficacy was confirmed in MDD (resistant to previous pharmacological treatments or not) (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.91; 95 % CI -1.19,-0.64; p\u2009<\u20090.01), in bipolar depression (SMD\u2009=\u2009-1.34; 95 % CI -1.94, -0.75), and in drug-free patients as well as patients under medication. Four ECT trials (118 patients) were included in our quantitative analysis. One hundred and three patients were diagnosed with major depressive disorder and 15 with bipolar depression. Overall, depression scores were significantly improved in the 58 patients receiving ketamine in ECT anesthesia induction compared to the 60 patients (SMD\u2009=\u2009-0.56; 95 % CI -1.10, -0.02; p\u2009=\u20090.04; I2\u2009=\u200952.4 %). The duration of ketamine's effects was assessed in only two non-ECT studies and seemed to persist for 2-3 days; this result needs to be confirmed. Three of four studies found significant decrease of suicidal thoughts and one found no difference between groups, but suicidal ideations were only studied by the suicide item of the depressive scales. It was not possible to determine a dose effect; 0.5 mg/kg was used in the majority of the studies. Some cardiovascular events were described (mostly transient blood pressure elevation that may require treatment), and ketamine's use should remain cautious in patients with a cardiovascular history. CONCLUSION: The present meta-analysis confirms ketamine's efficacy in depressive disorders in non-ECT studies, as well as in ECT studies. The results of this first meta-analysis are encouraging, and further studies are warranted to detail efficacy in bipolar disorders and other specific depressed populations. Middle- and long-term efficacy and safety have yet to be explored.

In this secondary analysis, the primary outcome measures of suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] and the Suicide Item of the 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS\u2082\u2088-SI]) were assessed at 240 minutes postinfusion and for 3 months thereafter in a naturalistic follow-up. RESULTS: Over the course of the infusions (acute treatment phase), 7 of 14 patients (50%) showed remission of suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS Ideation scale (even among patients whose depression did not remit). There was a significant linear decrease in this score over time (P < .001), which approached significance even after controlling for severity of 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS\u2086) core depression items (P = .05). Similarly, there were significant decreases in the C-SSRS Intensity (P < .01) and HDRS\u2082\u2088-SI (P < .001) scores during the acute treatment phase. Two of the 7 patients who achieved remission during the acute treatment phase (29%) maintained their remission throughout a 3-month naturalistic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, repeated doses of open-label ketamine rapidly and robustly decreased suicidal ideation in pharmacologically treated outpatients with treatment-resistant depression with stable suicidal thoughts; this decrease was maintained for at least 3 months following the final ketamine infusion in 2 patients.

Methods: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey \u2013 a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Results: Out of 10,293 past-year LSD users, 102 (1.0%) reported seeking EMT, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.2%. Younger age, comorbid mental health conditions and higher frequency of use were associated with increased risk of EMT seeking.

However, comparative data on the effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on negative emotions in healthy subjects have been partially missing. The aim of this study was to compare the acute effects of methylphenidate and modafinil on the neural correlates of fearful face processing using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine as a positive control. METHODS: Using a double-blind, within-subject, placebo-controlled, cross-over design, 60 mg methylphenidate, 600 mg modafinil, and 125 mg 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine were administrated to 22 healthy subjects while performing an event-related fMRI task to assess brain activation in response to fearful faces. Negative mood states were assessed with the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory and subjective ratings. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, modafinil, but not methylphenidate or 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, increased brain activation within a limbic-cortical-striatal-pallidal-thalamic circuit during fearful face processing. Modafinil but not methylphenidate also increased amygdala responses to fearful faces compared with 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine. Furthermore, activation in the middle and inferior frontal gyrus in response to fearful faces correlated positively with subjective feelings of fearfulness and depressiveness after modafinil administration.

Despite the availability of various treatments for depression, including pharmacotherapy, there is still a need to search for new agents with higher effectiveness and faster onset of action, especially for patients with treatment-resistant depression. AREAS COVERED: A substance that has attracted considerable attention for nearly a decade is psilocybin, a natural psychedelic found in psilocybin mushrooms. In this study, we evaluated the efficacy and safety of psilocybin in the treatment of depression, based on pivotal randomized clinical trials. Moreover, we used findings from observational studies regarding recreational use. We also looked at ongoing clinical trials and discussed the registration status and clinical potential of the drug. EXPERT OPINION: Clinical phase I-II trials published to date reported promising results for psilocybin in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression, in a relatively short time after administration. However, before psilocybin is approved for use and administered to patients with depression, the results of large ongoing phase III clinical trials are needed to confirm its efficacy and safety and to change the way it is perceived by physicians and patients.", "doi": "10.1080/14728214.2023.2264180", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37817501/", "secondary_title": "Expert Opin Emerg Drugs"}

Secondary outcomes were cardiovascular safety and acceptability. Ten studies were included. The estimated effect sizes (standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals) for psilocybin were -0.75 (-1.15 to -0.35) on day 1, -1.74 (-2.15 to -1.32) at 1 week, -1.35 (-1.77 to -0.93) at 1 month, -0.91 (-1.31 to -0.51) at 3 months, and -1.12 (-1.56 to -0.68) at 6 months. Higher doses and two sessions of psilocybin treatment were significantly associated with superior antidepressant effects. The all-cause discontinuation and heart rate after psilocybin administration were comparable to placebo; meanwhile, psilocybin increased systolic and diastolic blood pressure by 19.00 mmHg and 8.66 mmHg, respectively.

Results: The prevalence of past year ecstasy use rose from 2.8% to 4.7% between 1997 and 1999, an increase of 69%. This increase was observed across nearly all subgroups of student and college type. A smaller sample of ten colleges revealed that the increase continued in 2000. Ecstasy users were more likely to use marijuana, engage in binge drinking, smoke cigarettes, have multiple sexual partners, consider arts and parties as important, religion as less important, spend more times socializing with friends, and spend less times studying. Unlike other illicit drug users, ecstasy users were not academic underachievers and their satisfaction with education was not different from that of non-ecstasy users.

Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing enhances well-being and cognition; however, such accounts are potentially biased by the placebo effect. This study used a 'self-blinding' citizen science initiative, where participants were given online instructions on how to incorporate placebo control into their microdosing routine without clinical supervision. The study was completed by 191 participants, making it the largest placebo-controlled trial on psychedelics to-date. All psychological outcomes improved significantly from baseline to after the 4 weeks long dose period for the microdose group; however, the placebo group also improved and no significant between-groups differences were observed. Acute (emotional state, drug intensity, mood, energy, and creativity) and post-acute (anxiety) scales showed small, but significant microdose vs. placebo differences; however, these results can be explained by participants breaking blind. The findings suggest that anecdotal benefits of microdosing can be explained by the placebo effect. Psychedelic psychotherapy, therapy enhanced with psychedelic drugs such as LSD or psilocybin (the active ingredient of \u2018magic mushrooms\u2019), has been suggested to improve psychological well-being. For this reason, trials on psychedelic therapy for the treatment of depression, addiction and other conditions are ongoing. Recently, \u2018microdosing\u2019 \u2013 a way of administering psychedelics that involves taking about 10% of a recreational dose two or three times per week \u2013 has gained popularity. Unlike taking large doses of psychedelics, microdosing does not induce hallucinations, but anecdotal reports suggest that it yields similar benefits as psychedelic therapy. A key feature of modern medicine are \u2018placebo control\u2019 studies that compare two groups of patients: one that takes a drug and another that takes inactive pills, known as placebos. Crucially, neither group knows whether they are taking drug or placebo. This control ensures that observed effects are due to the drug itself and not to unrelated psychological causes. For example, in trials of mood medicines, participants often expect to feel happier, which in itself improves their mood even when taking a placebo. This is known as the placebo effect. Restrictive drug policies make placebo-controlled studies on psychedelics difficult and expensive, in particular for microdosing, which involves taking psychedelics over a longer time period. To overcome this problem, Szigeti et al. developed a new citizen-science approach, where microdosers implemented their own placebo control based on online instructions. The advantages are the low cost and the ability to recruit participants globally. The experiment was completed by 191 microdosers, making it the largest placebo-controlled study on psychedelics to-date, for a fraction of the cost of an equivalent clinical study. The trial examined whether psychedelic microdosing can improve cognitive function and psychological well-being. The team found that microdosing significantly increased a number of psychological measures, such as well-being and life satisfaction. However, participants taking placebo also improved: there were no significant differences between the two groups. The findings confirmed positive anecdotes about microdosing improving people\u2019s moods, but at the same time show that taking empty capsules, knowing they might be microdoses, have the same benefits. This result suggests that the observed benefits are not caused by the microdose, but rather by psychological expectations. The study\u2019s innovative \u2018do-it-yourself\u2019 approach to placebo control may serve as a template for future citizen science studies on other popular phenomena where positive expectations and social factors could play a role, such as cannabidiol (CBD) oils, nootropics and nutrition. eng", "doi": "10.7554/eLife.62878", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33648632/", "secondary_title": "Elife"}

Methods The databases Ovid MEDLINE(R), PsycINFO, and Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) were searched for case reports and trials involving humans in the treatment of ICD-10 anxiety and related disorders. Twenty-four studies are described; four describe anxiety symptoms in diverse patient groups, 14 studies describe historic diagnoses that usefully correspond with ICD-10 anxiety disorders, six studies pooled results or failed to detail results specific to contemporary ICD-10 anxiety disorders. Two of the 24 studies reported are individual case reports while two of them were inadequate in terms of the reporting of outcome measures. Thus 20 studies were ultimately included in the summary analysis. Results Three of the 20 studies reviewed described improvements in anxiety by standardized measures (p < .05) and two studies found that this effect was dose related.

This study aimed to investigate the effects of a single dose of each drug individually along with their combined usage on postoperative mood changes in patients undergoing gynecologic surgery. Methods: Two hundred ninety-seven patients randomly allocated were divided into three groups. Group K (n = 99) received a single dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg iv); group D (n = 99) received a single dose of dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg iv), and group KD (n = 99) received both ketamine (0.5 mg/kg iv) and dexamethasone (0.1 mg/kg iv) at 5 min after the induction of anesthesia. A change in the patient health questionnaire (PHQ)-9 scores on the first and third day after surgery, the duration of anesthesia, the postoperative visual analog scale (VAS) for pain, and the patient controlled analgesia (PCA) consumption were evaluated. Results: Groups K and KD showed a significant reduction in PHQ-9 score on both the first and third day after surgery compared with those recorded preoperatively and in group D (P < 0.01).

The management of MDD in the palliative care setting can be challenging as typical antidepressants may not work in time nor be tolerated due to coexisting organ dysfunctions, symptom burden and frailty. Parenteral ketamine was found to exhibit effective and rapid-onset antidepressant effect even against treatment-resistant depression in the psychiatric population. However, there is currently neither feasibility study nor available prospective study available to inform of the safety, tolerability and efficacy of such for MDD in the palliative setting. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is an open-labelled, single arm, phase II pilot feasibility study involving adult patients with advanced life-limiting illnesses and MDD across four palliative care services in Australia. It has an individual dose-titration design (0.1-0.4\u2009mg/kg) with weekly treatments of subcutaneous ketamine infusion over 2\u2009hours. The primary outcome is feasibility. The secondary outcomes are related to the safety, tolerability and antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, participants' satisfaction in relation to the trial process and the reasons for not completing the study at various stages. The feasibility data will be reported using descriptive statistics. Meanwhile, side effects, tolerability and efficacy data will be analysed using change of assessment scores from baseline.

Automated speech analysis may represent a novel method to detect objective markers, which could help improve the characterization of these mental states. In this study, we employed computer-extracted speech features from multiple domains (acoustic, semantic, and psycholinguistic) to assess mental states after controlled administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and intranasal oxytocin. The training/validation set comprised within-participants data from 31 healthy adults who, over four sessions, were administered MDMA (0.75, 1.5\u2009mg/kg), oxytocin (20 IU), and placebo in randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants completed two 5-min speech tasks during peak drug effects. Analyses included group-level comparisons of drug conditions and estimation of classification at the individual level within this dataset and on two independent datasets. Promising classification results were obtained to detect drug conditions, achieving cross-validated accuracies of up to 87% in training/validation and 92% in the independent datasets, suggesting that the detected patterns of speech variability are associated with drug consumption. Specifically, we found that oxytocin seems to be mostly driven by changes in emotion and prosody, which are mainly captured by acoustic features. In contrast, mental states driven by MDMA consumption appear to manifest in multiple domains of speech. Furthermore, we find that the experimental task has an effect on the speech response within these mental states, which can be attributed to presence or absence of an interaction with another individual.

Treatment effects were analyzed with a linear mixed effects (LME) model.

We also examined the trajectory of response and remission, and the time to relapse among responders. METHODS: TRD subjects had at least 2-month period of stable dose of antidepressants.

Several cross-sectional investigations reported low memory and learning performance in ecstasy users, particularly in those reporting heavy patterns of drug use. Since, serotonin has a recognized role in memory processes, these findings were mostly interpreted as evidence for ecstasy-related neurotoxicity in humans. However, studies with user populations and controls suffer from many inherent methodological problems. Moreover, longitudinal data on memory performance after continued or discontinued ecstasy use are scarce. Methods: In the present longitudinal study, we examined memory performance in 38 MDMA users over the course of 18 months. Results: Subjects who stopped MDMA use after the baseline examination (n = 17) did not improve, and subjects who continued MDMA use (n = 21) did not deteriorate in terms of test performance. Conclusions: Our data do not support, but they also do not rule out memory decline following use of the serotonergic neurotoxin MDMA. In light of the popularity of ecstasy among young people, further investigations are needed. In our view, research strategies should now move to prospective designs in order to shed more light on the course of possible adverse cognitive effects of ecstasy use. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

AIM: This is an updated meta-analysis of the efficacy and safety of ketamine augmentation of ECT in the treatment of MDD. METHODS: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) reporting on the efficacy and safety of ketamine and ECT were identified and analyzed. RESULTS: Seventeen RCTs (n\u202f=\u202f1,035) compared ketamine alone or ketamine plus other anesthetic drugs (n\u202f=\u202f557) with other anesthetic agents (n\u202f=\u202f478) in MDD patients who received ECT. Ketamine+other anesthetic drugs was superior in improving depressive symptoms over other anesthetic medications at early study time point, but not at post-ECT or end of study time points. Ketamine alone was not more efficacious in treating depressive symptoms than other anesthetic drugs at early study, post-ECT and end of study time points. Sensitivity analysis and 19 of the 20 subgroup analyses also confirmed the lack of significance of these findings. Eleven RCTs testing the effects of ketamine on neurocognitive functions with various test batteries found mixed results. Ketamine alone significantly increased blood pressure more than other anesthetic drugs in MDD treated with ECT.

Although existing studies have investigated the efficacy of ESK in the 4-week induction phase, our knowledge about long-term ESK efficacy remains poor. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on long-term ESK efficacy for TRD. A systematic search was performed including articles in English, up to 31 March 2021. The search found 7 relevant studies, involving 1024 adult TRD patients. Continuing treatment with ESK after the 4-week induction phase may be associated with stable efficacy in relapse prevention among TRD patients. Conversely, the long-term antidepressant effectiveness upon discontinuation of ESK might be limited, although data from three studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. Overall, the results on the effectiveness of this compound in the long term are mixed. According to our findings, ESK treatment should be continued following the induction phase to reach a stable efficacy in relapse prevention, while the long-term antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ESK after discontinuation are inconsistent. Currently, the level of proof of ESK efficacy in long-term TRD treatment remains low and more RCTs with larger sample sizes and active comparators are needed.", "doi": "10.3390/ijms22179338", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34502248/", "secondary_title": "Int J Mol Sci"}

Most MDMA users, however, use other illicit drugs as well, so it is difficult to be certain that these deficits are due to MDMA, as opposed to other drug use or additional confounding factors. Methods: We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 23 young MDMA users who reported minimal exposure to any other drugs, including alcohol, and to 16 comparison individuals equally involved with the rave subculture, but reporting no MDMA use. We compared the groups by regression analyses adjusting for numerous potentially confounding variables. To test for a possible dose-response effect, we also performed a median split of 12 moderate MDMA users (22-50 lifetime uses) and 11 heavy users (60-450 uses), and compared these subgroups with non-users. Results: MDMA users as a whole performed worse than non-users on most test measures, but these comparisons rarely reached statistical significance. This picture changed markedly in the subgroup analysis: although moderate users displayed virtually no differences from non-users on any measures, the heavy users displayed significant deficits on many measures, particularly those associated with mental processing speed and impulsivity. These differences did not appear explainable by differences in family-of-origin variables, verbal IQ, levels of depression, or time since last MDMA use. Conclusions: The presence of residual cognitive deficits, even among unusually \"pure\" frequent users of illicit MDMA, analyzed with adjustment for confounding variables, augments the evidence that MDMA itself, rather than some associated factor, is responsible for the deficits observed. \u00a9 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n\u202f=\u202f30) and nonanxious TRD (n\u202f=\u202f20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5\u202fmg/kg over 40\u202fmin) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p\u202f=\u202f0.028).

{"record_id": 6148, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Suicidal Ideation']", "text": "A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Music for Suicidal Ideation.^\nKetamine is a glutamate N\u2010methyl\u2010D\u2010aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist traditionally used as a general anesthetic. Recent double blinded randomized control trials of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions have been well\u2010tolerated and demonstrated a rapid onset of antidepressant effect, most notably in subjects with treatment\u2010resistant depression (TRD) and treatment\u2010resistant bipolar depression. Significance. The outcomes of current therapy for depression are poor, with roughly a third of patient's failing to improve or regressing. The patients are high risk for suicide and the need for rapid acting, durable treatments for reduction of suicidal ideation is paramount. Ketamine has been shown to improve suicidal ideation for at least 6 weeks in the largest study of ketamine for SI to date in subjects recruited to participate in the clinical trial and admitted to a research facility. We intend to test ketamine in a more pragmatic trial in the ER in patients who are not actively recruited, but report SI to ER staff or have SI as a chief complaint. Research Aims. Overview. In the current open label randomized control trial, we will examine the suicidal ideation reducing efficacy of IV ketamine combined with music and treatment as usual in four groups. All four groups will receive treatment as usual as defined above (potential hospitalization, medication, psychotherapy, outpatient referrals, suicide safety planning). A factorial design is being implemented to test two interventions independently and combined: ketamine and music. One group will receive IV ketamine 0.5mg/kg infused over forty minutes with one hour of pre\u2010planned music will be compared to 3 other groups: One group will receive the same dose of ketamine without music, one group will one hour of music without ketamine, and one group will receive neither music nor ketamine. During the 4\u2010week follow up interval, subjects from both groups will be contacted by phone for weekly assessment of depression, SI and quality of life. A playlist by composer Nils Frahm will be played for 60 minutes. The music is instrumental, relaxing and subjectively thought to be uplifting by patients who have listened to the music during ketamine infusions performed previously by the PI for treatment of resistant depression. Music can be previewed at the link below: https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZF1DWVbGPBkXJYHF Patients will be screened for study entry by the emergency room (ER) treating physician who will be available 24 hours a day who will notify the clinical trials research staff that a subject is available to be screened. Dr. Robert Creath Er attending will be the primary coordinator of Er services. The clinical trials staff that will be assigned to the project by the UTHET north campus department of clinical research. will then screen the subject for entry to the study, and perform the informed consent process. The subject will then be randomized by clinical trials staff using block randomization to each group. A 1:1 assignment to each group will be implemented with permuted blocks between 4 and 6 with equal probability. Patients entering the study will be voluntarily admitted to the hospital or monitored in the ER for a minimum of 2 hours after the first IV ketamine or music treatment and discharged when deemed to not be a suicide risk by a treating physician. A driver will be required to take the subject home if discharged the same day as the ketamine treatment. Subjects deemed to be a continued risk to themselves or others will be admitted as per clinician discretion which is considered treatment as usual. The ER nurse will be administering the sub\u2010anesthetic dose of ketamine. Vital signs including, blood pressure, pulse oxygenation will be monitored at fifteen\u2010minute intervals during the infusion, and will be recorded for 30 minutes after the infusion at fifteen minute intervals. Subjects will be followed up by phone at weekly intervals and voluntary hospitalization will be recommended for patients with SSI score of \u22654. Psychotropic medications w ll be adjusted and optimized at the discretion of the treating physicians at study entry. Medications may be modified during the 4\u2010week study interval in line with standard practice. Informed consent will be obtained for all participants. Informed consent will be obtained in person when possible or by the Teams telemedicine app when necessary if research staff is unavailable on site. The primary outcome measure of this study will be treatment response, defined as a \u226550% score reduction in the SSI from baseline to 4 weeks after the first ketamine injection. Remission will be defined as a \u226550% reduction in SSI score with score \u22644. The SSI will be administered at baseline, prior to each treatment and 24 hours after IV ketamine administration, then every week during the symptom monitoring follow\u2010up period of 4 weeks. The clinician\u2010rated SSI assesses current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). Medications may be adjusted during the study interval. Secondary outcome will be change in MADRS and SSI score from baseline to 4 weeks after the treatment. Raters will be blinded to the subject treatment group. During the 4\u2010week follow up participants will be contacted by phone with follow\u2010up questions regarding their overall health status, mood and clinical state using MADRS, SSI, QIDS and other clinical scales listed below. Study/Design. Patients with clinically documented depression with SI will be screened for diagnosis of depressive episode with the Mini\u2010International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI), a structured interview of psychiatric disorders, at baseline to establish the presence of a major depressive episode. The depressive episode could be associated with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder or substance induced depressive disorder. Procedure Portable speakers will be provided playing relaxing music prior to and during the administration of ketamine for groups 2 and 3 (Nils Frahm playlist\u2010modern classical composer). This music has been previously used at Christus Mother Francis for therapeutic ketamine use with good results. Subjects will be inform that music can be stopped by request at any time. Informed consent and screening will be performed in the UTHET north campus clinical trials staff at initial presentation. Follow up assessments during weeks 1\u20104 will be done by phone. Clinical research staff will randomize subjects to treatment groups as documented above. Ketamine IV will be supplied by the UT Health East Texas pharmacy. The administration of ketamine will be initiated by the emergency room nurse with ACLS certified physician supervision. Prior to the treatment, patients will be undergo psychiatric interview by the University of Texas Health center at Tyler psychiatric ER consult liaison team as per standard practice. An ACLS certified physician will be nearby in the ER post\u2010procedure for 1 hour or until a clinician deems patient is clinically stable. We plan on utilizing the monitoring protocol advised by the American Psychiatric Association consensus statement: \"(1) assessment of respiratory status (i.e., oxygen saturation or end\u2010tidal CO2); (2) assessment of cardiovascular function (blood pressure and heart rate, reported on a regular basis every 15 minutes); (3) assessment of the level of consciousness or other documented assessment of responsiveness; and (4) delineation of criteria for stopping the infusion and a clear plan for managing cardiovascular or behavioral events during treatment.\" Adverse events will be monitored and recorded throughout the study. The most common side effects associated with ketamine are nausea, vomiting, dizziness, double vision, drowsiness, elevated blood pressure, tachycardia, anxiety, dissociation (feeling strange and disconnected from the world), and confusion. Delirium, hallucinations, and nightmares have been associated with high dose ketamine, but are not common side effects in subanesthetic ketamine treatment. The subanesthetic dose of 0.5 mg/kg has been documented to be safe and we l tolerated in numerous clinical trials in the treatment of suicidal thoughts. Rare but serious possible adverse event associated with ketamine include: Cardiac arrest, diabetes insipidus, anaphylaxis, ocular hypertension, increased intracranial pressure, arrythmia exacerbation or apnea. Digital pulse oximetry, blood pressure, heart rate, and respiratory rate will be monitored throughout the injection at 15 minute intervals with a recovery period similar to recent study of IV ketamine for PTSD and TRD performed at the Minneapolis VA. Vital signs, the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) will be assessed pre\u2010dose, at 40 minutes after ketamine infusion has started. Hypertensive emergency, respiratory failure or cardiac arrest is not known to have occurred in previous clinical trials of IV ketamine for treatment of depression. Emergency room physicians will be notified and render care in the event of unexpected medical emergencies. The infusions will be stopped if a patient requests stopping the infusion, becomes agitated, or goes into respiratory failure or cardiac arrest. Medical emergencies will be managed by ACLS certified ER physicians. Code BERT will be called as necessary if a patient becomes acutely agitated and presents a danger to themselves or others. Medications will be optimized as per standard practice throughout the 4\u2010week study. Suicide safety plans, referrals to outpatient treatments will done as per standard practice. Participants will be directed to contact the nearest ER in case of emergency after initial hospital discharge. Participants will be contacted weekly during the 4\u2010week study period to review the patient's health status and administer clinical scales by phone. Clinical assessment. Informed consent will be obtained. This evaluation will obtain family history and demographic data. We will perform a urine drug screening (UDS) to rule out recent undisclosed use of illicit substances that may exclude subjects from the study. Demographic information is obtained through a standardized form and covers age, race, gender, education (information both on siblings and their parents), religion, and socioeconomic status. Participants will fill out the mood questionnaires rating the severity of the clinical symptoms. Participants will be asked about previous medications they have taken for mental health disorders and general medical conditions. Results will be stored in a secure location by the department of clinical research. Selected mood assessment questionnaires will be administered by our clinical research staff including the MINI Interview. This is the standard psychiatric research evaluation for ascertainment of psychiatric diagnosis in the context of research studies. It is a comprehensive structured interview for determining axis I diagnosis according to the DSM\u2010V to be administered at study entry and takes approximately 15 minutes. We will also use the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS): this scale rates depressive symptoms, and its psychometric properties are well\u2010established. We will assess SI with the Suicidal Scale Instrument. The clinician\u2010rated SSI assessed current severity of suicidal ideation with 19 items scaled from 0 (least severe) to 2 (most severe). We will also assess dissociation with the Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS): Frequency of administration: After every treatment, to monitor the dissociative side effects status post infusion. Self\u2010report questionnaires to assess mood, and quality of life will include Quick inventory of depressive symptomatology QIDS\u2010SR to measure self\u2010reported depressive symptoms, weekly and the World health organization quality of life scale.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT04658420"}

Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA\u2010induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone1) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone1 (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with Metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA\u2010induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA\u2010induced memory deficit from happening.

All of the data were analyzed using repeated\u2010measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with drug (LSD vs. placebo) as the withinsubjects factor and dose (100 mg vs. 200 mg) as the betweensubjects factor, followed by the Tukey post hoc test based on significant main effects or interactions. Results and Conclusion: LSD produced its known effects on perception but also subjective feelings of closeness to others and wanting to be with others (significant main effects of drug: F1,38 = 61.68, p<0.01, and F1,38 = 79.87, p<0.001, respectively) with a clear dose effect (drug \u00d7 dose interaction: F1,38 = 5.38, p<0.05, and F1,38 = 16.25, p<0.001, respectively). FERT and MET data were available from 38 subjects. LSD enhanced explicit and implicit emotional empathy on the MET (main effect of drug: F1,36 = 14.05, p<0.001, and F1,36 = 6.71, p = 0.01, respectively). Valence\u2010specific analysis showed that LSD significantly increased explicit and implicit emotional empathy scores for positive emotional stimuli (F1,36 = 24.32, p<0.001, and F1,36 = 10.47, p<0.01, respectively) but not for negative emotional stimuli. LSD impaired the recognition of sad (F1,36 = 7.36, p = 0.01) and fearful faces (F1,36 = 20.71, p<0.001) on the FERT. No significant effects of LSD on the decoding of neutral, happy, or angry facial expressions were found. LSD enhanced prosocial behavior on the SVO test (F1,38 = 4.31, p<0.05). Altogether, these effects of LSD on emotion processing and sociality may be useful for LSD\u2010assisted psychotherapy.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology"}

Predicting whether a specific treatment will be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms for a particular patient is difficult, and identifying measurable biological markers, or biomarkers, that could be assessed in individuals to help identify an effective treatment would be valuable. Previous research has used neuroimaging measures at baseline to test for potential correlations with treatment response in depression. Neural biomarkers of response may be challenging to identify for most pharmacological treatments for MDD, due to the length of time it takes for many antidepressants to show effects (potentially several weeks). The rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, make this compound well\u2010suited for investigating biomarkers that correlate with treatment response. We examined blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI) during an emotional processing task in patients with MDD to determine if pretreatment activation correlated with subsequent antidepressant response after ketamine. Methods: Participants included 31 patients with MDD, ages 18 to 65, who took part in this study as part of a large doubleblind placebo\u2010controlled protocol on the mechanism of action of ketamine. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after participants received an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). At baseline, BOLD signal was measured using a 3T GE fMRI scanner during an emotional processing task. In this mixed block/event\u2010related task, participants viewed faces with emotional expressions (angry, sad, neutral, and happy), randomly presented either rightside up or upside\u2010down. Participants were instructed to press a button to judge the emotion in one block and to identify the gender in the other block. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed using AFNI. Preprocessing included despiking, aligning images, registering echo\u2010planar to structural images, blurring to 6 mm, normalizing, and motion correction. Firstlevel individual analyses were conducted using regressors for each stimulus and block type. Group analysis used a multivariate model with the task factors and with a quantitative variable for the percent change in MADRS score from baseline to one day after the ketamine infusion. Results were thresholded at p<0.05, family wise error corrected (with voxel\u2010wise p<0.01). Results: We found a significant correlation between BOLD signal during the emotional processing task at baseline and percent change in MADRS score after ketamine. This was found in a large cluster in the left insula, extending into left inferior and middle frontal gyri, as well as in a cluster in the right precuneus. For both regions, greater activation at baseline was associated with better antidepressant response to ketamine (decrease in MADRS score of depressive symptoms). This was found across the entire task, not related to any specific task factors. We did not find any brain areas that showed the opposite pattern of greater activation correlating with poorer response. Conclusions: Our findings showed that pretreatment brain activity was correlated with response to ketamine, with the most significant result found in the left insula. The insula plays a role in emotional processing and has been previously associated with neuroimaging findings related to depression. While prior research has shown some associations between insula activation and response to other medications, there have been mixed findings. This could be related to different tasks being used or differential response depending on the specific treatment. Using functional neuroimaging as a biomarker to predict the likelihood of antidepressant response to ketamine would be greatly beneficial for patients with MDD. This would also be a valuable way for clinicians to work towards individualized treatment for psychiatric il ness.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2017.266", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500146/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

A hypoactive prefrontal cortex (PFC) and a hyperactive amygdala have been suggested to be associated with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, it is unclear whether the rapid antidepressant mechanisms of ketamine on TRD involve changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission in the PFC and the amygdala. METHODS: A group of 48 TRD patients were recruited and equally randomized into three groups (A: 0.5 kg/mg-ketamine; B: 0.2 kg/mg-ketamine; and C: normal saline [NS]). Standardized uptake values (SUV) of glucose metabolism measured by (18) F-FDG positron-emission-tomography before and immediately after a 40-min ketamine or NS infusion were used for subsequent region-of-interest (ROI) analyses (a priori regions: PFC and amygdala) and whole-brain voxel-wise analyses and were correlated with antidepressant responses, as defined by the Hamilton depression rating scale score. The (18) F-FDG signals were used as a proxy measure of glutamate neurotransmission. RESULTS: The ROI analysis indicated that Group A and Group B, but not Group C, had increases in the SUV of the PFC (group-by-time interaction: F\u2009=\u20097.373, P\u2009=\u20090.002), whereas decreases in the SUV of the amygdala were observed in all three groups (main effect of time, P\u2009<\u20090.001). The voxel-wise analysis further confirmed a significant group effect on the PFC (corrected for family-wise errors, P\u2009<\u20090.05; post hoc analysis: Group A<Group C, Group B<Group C). The SUV differences in the PFC predicted the antidepressant responses at 40 and 240 min post-treatment. The PFC changes did not differ between those with and without side effects.

One of the key mechanistic hypotheses for how ketamine works to alleviate depression is by enhancing long-term potentiation (LTP)-mediated neural plasticity. METHODS: The objective of this study was to investigate the plasticity hypothesis in 30 patients with depression noninvasively using visual LTP as an index of neural plasticity. In a double-blind, active placebo-controlled crossover trial, electroencephalography-based LTP was recorded approximately 3 to 4 hours following a single 0.44-mg/kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo (1.7 ng/mL remifentanil) in 30 patients. Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores were used to measure clinical symptoms. Visual LTP was measured as a change in the visually evoked potential following high-frequency visual stimulation. Dynamic causal modeling investigated the underlying neural architecture of visual LTP and the contribution of ketamine. RESULTS: Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores revealed that 70% of participants experienced 50% or greater reduction in their depression symptoms within 1 day of receiving ketamine. LTP was demonstrated in the N1 (p\u00a0= .00002) and P2 (p\u00a0= 2.31\u00a0\u00d7 10(-11)) visually evoked components. Ketamine specifically enhanced P2 potentiation compared with placebo (p\u00a0= .017). Dynamic causal modeling replicated the recruitment of forward and intrinsic connections for visual LTP and showed complementary effects of ketamine indicative of downstream and proplasticity modulation. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides evidence that LTP-based neural plasticity increases within the time frame of the antidepressant effects of ketamine in humans and supports the hypothesis that changes to neural plasticity may be key to the antidepressant properties of ketamine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsc.2019.07.002", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31495712/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging"}

This variability may reflect the cognitive complexity of the memory tasks. However, previous studies have tested only a limited range of cognitive complexity. Furthermore, comparisons across different studies are made difficult by regional variations in ecstasy composition and patterns of use. Objectives: The objective of this study is to evaluate ecstasy-related deficits in human verbal memory over a wide range of cognitive complexity using subjects drawn from a single geographical population. Materials and methods: Ecstasy users were compared to non-drug using controls on verbal tasks with low cognitive complexity (stem completion), moderate cognitive complexity (stem-cued recall and word list learning) and high cognitive complexity (California Verbal Learning Test, Verbal Paired Associates and a novel Verbal Triplet Associates test). Where significant differences were found, both groups were also compared to cannabis users. Results: More cognitively complex memory tasks were associated with clearer ecstasy-related deficits than low complexity tasks. In the most cognitively demanding task, ecstasy-related deficits remained even after multiple learning opportunities, whereas the performance of cannabis users approached that of non-drug using controls. Ecstasy users also had weaker deliberate strategy use than both non-drug and cannabis controls. Conclusions: Results were consistent with the proposal that ecstasy-related memory deficits are more reliable on tasks with greater cognitive complexity.

We hypothesised that when combination of ketamine and propofol is used, the adverse effects of one drug will be counteracted by the other drug, i.e., propofol causes hypotension while ketamine raises blood pressure, propofol is not an analgesic while ketamine is; ketamine causes emergence phenomenon while propofol blunts emergence and ketamine causes vomiting while propofol is an anti\u2010emetic Methods This double blind study was conducted on 90 ASA grade I and II patients undergoing laparoscopic tubal ligation as day care surgery, randomly divided into three groups of 30 patients each. Patients were induced in Group I: 7 mL 1% propofol + 1 mL 5% ketamine + 2 mL Normal Saline; Group II: 7 mL 1% propofol + 2 mL 5% ketamine + 1 mL Normal Saline; Group III: 7 mL 1% propofol + 3 mL 5% ketamine. Patients recovery profile was assessed every 30 min, commencing from the time of completion of the procedure till 3 hours post laparoscopic tubal ligation using Modified Aldrete Scoring System, Revised PADSS and Fast \u2010Track eligibility criteria. Results were analyzed by chi\u2010square and by working out the critical difference through Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Results The physical activity and consciousness level returned to normal earliest in group III which was at 90 and 60 min respectively. It may be due to the least amount of propofol administered. This was followed by group II at 120 min using Modified Aldrete Scoring System and at 150 min using Revised PADSS. In group I, recovery was at 150 min. The mean dose of propofol and ketamine given in group III (932.40 \u00b1 166.6 and 199.80 \u00b1 35.7 \u03bcg/kg respectively) was the least among all the groups.

Attempting to reduce methodological problems, such as concurrent use of other recreational drugs, could lead to a clearer picture of the effects of ecstasy use on cognitive function. Objectives: The aim of this study is to investigate the effects of both prolonged abstention from ecstasy use and current use on cognitive function while controlling for the regular use of other recreational drugs used by ecstasy users (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines and lysergic acid diethylamide). Materials and methods: A range of cognitive functions (including working memory, episodic memory, verbal learning and executive functions) was assessed in 109 participants: 25 current ecstasy users, 28 ex-ecstasy users (abstinent for at least 1 year), 29 polydrug-using controls (matched to both ecstasy-using groups for the use of other recreational drugs) and 27 drug-na\u00efve controls. Results: There was an overall tendency for impaired verbal learning and memory in both current ecstasy users and polydrug controls. There was also evidence of reduced response inhibition in the current ecstasy users and polydrug controls, which appeared to be related to recency of drug use.

Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia. Preclinical studies indicate that some ketamine effects may be mediated through increased glutamate release. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that lamotrigine, a drug reported to inhibit glutamate release, will reduce the neuropsychiatric effects of ketamine in humans. METHOD: Healthy subjects (n = 16) completed 4 test days involving the administration of lamotrigine, 300 mg by mouth, or placebo 2 hours prior to administration of ketamine (0.26 mg/kg by intravenous bolus and 0.65 mg/kg per hour by intravenous infusion) or placebo in a randomized order under double-blind conditions. Behavioral and cognitive assessments were performed at baseline and after administration of the medications. RESULTS: Lamotrigine significantly decreased ketamine-induced perceptual abnormalities as assessed by the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (P<.001); positive symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale positive symptoms subscale (P<.001); negative symptoms as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale negative symptoms subscale (P<.05); and learning and memory impairment as assessed by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test (P<.05). However, lamotrigine increased the immediate mood-elevating effects of ketamine (P<.05). CONCLUSIONS: Glutamate release-inhibiting drugs may reduce the hyperglutamatergic consequences of NMDA receptor dysfunction implicated in the pathophysiologic processes of neuropsychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia.

Aims: The purpose of the present study was to give a retrospective account of the short-term outcome of LSD treatment in these 151 Danish psychiatric patients. Methods: The LSD case material in the Danish State Archives consists of medical case records of 151 LSD-treated patients, who complained and received economic compensation with the LSD Damages Law. The author carefully read and reviewed the LSD case material. Results: LSD was used to treat a wide spectrum of mental disorders. Independent of diagnoses, 52 patients improved, and 48 patients worsened acutely with the LSD treatment. In a subgroup of 82 neurotic patients, the LSD dose-index (number of treatments multiplied by the maximal LSD dose) indicated the risk of acute worsening. In another subgroup of 19 patients with obsessive-compulsive neurosis, five patients later underwent psychosurgery. A small subgroup of 12 patients was treated with psilocybin. The long-term outcome was poor in most of the patients. Conclusions: Despite the significant limitations to a retrospective design, this database warrants caution in mental health patients.

Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations.

However, evidence suggests that standard treatments for depression do little to alleviate the symptoms of anhedonia and may cause reward blunting. Indeed, no therapeutics are currently approved for the treatment of anhedonia. Notably, over half of patients diagnosed with bipolar disorder experience significant levels of anhedonia during a depressive episode. Recent research into novel and rapid-acting therapeutics for depression, particularly the noncompetitive N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine, has highlighted the role of the glutamatergic system in the treatment of depression; however, it is unknown whether ketamine specifically improves anhedonic symptoms. The present study used a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover design to examine whether a single ketamine infusion could reduce anhedonia levels in 36 patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The study also used positron emission tomography imaging in a subset of patients to explore the neurobiological mechanisms underpinning ketamine's anti-anhedonic effects. We found that ketamine rapidly reduced the levels of anhedonia. Furthermore, this reduction occurred independently from reductions in general depressive symptoms. Anti-anhedonic effects were specifically related to increased glucose metabolism in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex and putamen.

METHODS: Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125\u00a0mg) during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2\u00a0months after the last active MDMA session (treatment exit), and at least 12\u00a0months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was summarized at each time point.

CAPS-IV scores continued to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE)\u2009=\u2009-\u20095.2 (2.29), p\u2009<\u2009.05), with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI\u2009=\u20090.04, 0.43). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study participation. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2\u00a0months after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12\u00a0months post-treatment. Phase 3 trials are investigating this novel treatment approach in a larger sample of participants with chronic PTSD.

However, its clinical utility compared with intranasal esketamine and the other well-studied conventional pharmacological interventions (i.e., aripiprazole and lithium) as augmentative treatments for treatment-resistant unipolar depression in adults remains unclear. Therefore, we aimed to compare the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of intravenous racemic ketamine with intranasal esketamine, aripiprazole and lithium under such conditions. METHODS: The Cochrane Library, PubMed, CINHAL and ClinicalTrials.gov databases were systematically searched from their inception to 10 May 2023. Randomised controlled trials evaluating these drugs were included. A random-effects network meta-analysis was also performed. RESULTS: In the primary analysis, all four drugs were significantly more effective than placebo. In addition, intravenous racemic ketamine was significantly more effective and acceptable than intranasal esketamine and aripiprazole. Intravenous racemic ketamine was not significantly different from placebo in tolerability, whereas intranasal esketamine and aripiprazole were significantly less tolerable than placebo. Lithium did not differ significantly from intravenous racemic ketamine in efficacy, tolerability and acceptability. LIMITATIONS: The sample size of patients treated with intravenous racemic ketamine was small. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous racemic ketamine may be a better augmentative treatment for treatment-resistant unipolar depression than intranasal esketamine and aripiprazole.

METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design, 24 healthy volunteers received 50 \u03bcg d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo. Psychotic experience was assessed by aberrant salience (Aberrant Salience Inventory, ASI), therapeutic potential by suggestibility (Creative Imagination Scale, CIS) and mindfulness (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire, FFMQ; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale, MAAS; Experiences Questionnaire, EQ), and psychedelic experience by four questionnaires (Altered State of Consciousness Questionnaire, ASC; Mystical Experiences Questionnaire, MEQ; Challenging Experiences Questionnaire, CEQ; Ego-Dissolution Inventory, EDI). Relationships between LSD-induced effects were examined. RESULTS: LSD induced psychedelic experiences, including alteration of consciousness, mystical experiences, ego-dissolution, and mildly challenging experiences, increased aberrant salience and suggestibility, but not mindfulness. LSD-induced aberrant salience correlated highly with complex imagery, mystical experiences, and ego-dissolution. LSD-induced suggestibility correlated with no other effects. Individual mindfulness changes correlated with aspects of aberrant salience and psychedelic experience. CONCLUSIONS: The LSD state resembles a psychotic experience and offers a tool for healing. The link between psychosis model and therapeutic model seems to lie in mystical experiences.

Methods: Data (2010\u20132017) were drawn from a community-based, prospective open cohort of marginalized women in Vancouver, Canada. Extended Cox regression analyses examined the moderating effect of psychedelic use on the association between other illicit drug use and incidence of suicidal ideation or attempt over follow-up. Results: Of 340 women without suicidal ideation or attempt at baseline, 16% (n=53) reported a first suicidal episode during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.63 per 100 person-years (95% confidence interval 3.53\u20136.07).

Molecular pharmacology studies have shown that psychedelic 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT)2A agonists stimulate neurotrophic and transcription factors associated with synaptic plasticity. These data suggest that psychedelics could potentially induce structural changes in brain tissue. Here we looked for differences in cortical thickness (CT) in regular users of psychedelics. We obtained magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) images of the brains of 22 regular users of ayahuasca (a preparation whose active principle is the psychedelic 5HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT)) and 22 controls matched for age, sex, years of education, verbal IQ and fluid IQ. Ayahuasca users showed significant CT differences in midline structures of the brain, with thinning in the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), a key node of the default mode network. CT values in the PCC were inversely correlated with the intensity and duration of prior use of ayahuasca and with scores on self-transcendence, a personality trait measuring religiousness, transpersonal feelings and spirituality. Although direct causation cannot be established, these data suggest that regular use of psychedelic drugs could potentially lead to structural changes in brain areas supporting attentional processes, self-referential thought, and internal mentation. These changes could underlie the previously reported personality changes in long-term users and highlight the involvement of the PCC in the effects of psychedelics.", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroneuro.2015.01.008", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25637267/", "secondary_title": "European Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Ketamine is thought to exert its antidepressant action by restoring neuroplasticity. In order to test for acute impact of a single ketamine infusion on grey matter volume we performed a placebo-controlled, double-blind investigation in healthy volunteers using VBM. 28 healthy individuals underwent two MRI sessions within a timeframe of 2 weeks, each consisting of two structural T1-weighted MRIs within a single session, one before and one 45 min after infusion of S-ketamine (bolus of 0.11mg/kg, followed by an maintenance infusion of 0.12 mg/kg) or placebo (0.9% NaCl infusion) using a crossover design. In the repeated-measures ANOVA with time (post-infusion/pre-infusion) and medication (placebo/ketamine) as factors, no significant effect of interaction and no effect of medication was found (FWE-corrected). Importantly, further post-hoc t-tests revealed a strong 'decrease' of grey matter both in the placebo and the ketamine condition over time. This effect was evident mainly in frontal and temporal regions bilaterally with t-values ranging from 4.95 to 5.31 (FWE-corrected at p < 0.05 voxel level). The vulnerabilities of VBM have been repeatedly demonstrated, with reports of influence of blood flow, tissue water and direct effects of pharmacological compounds on the MRI signal. Here again, we highlight that the relationship between intervention and VBM results is apparently subject to a number of physiological influences, which are partly unknown. Future studies focusing on the effects of ketamine on grey matter should try to integrate known influential factors such as blood flow into analysis. Furthermore, the results of this study highlight the importance of a carefully performed placebo condition in pharmacological fMRI studies.

While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD).

In the original article one of the percentages in Table 1 was misreported.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-31836-003[/rid]). Objective: About one-third of patients with depression fail to achieve remission despite treatment with multiple antidepressants. This study compared the efficacy and safety of switching patients with treatment-resistant depression from an ineffective antidepressant to flexibly dosed esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated antidepressant or to a newly initiated antidepressant (active comparator) plus placebo nasal spray. Methods: This was a phase 3, double-blind, active-controlled, multicenter study conducted at 39 outpatient referral centers. The study enrolled adults with moderate to severe nonpsychotic depression and a history of nonresponse to at least two antidepressants in the current episode, with one antidepressant assessed prospectively. Confirmed nonresponders were randomly assigned to treatment with esketamine nasal spray (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) and an antidepressant or antidepressant and placebo nasal spray. The primary efficacy endpoint, change from baseline to day 28 in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score, was assessed by a mixed-effects model using repeated measures. Results: Of 435 patients screened, 227 underwent randomization and 197 completed the 28-day double-blind treatment phase. Change in MADRS score with esketamine plus antidepressant was significantly greater than with antidepressant plus placebo at day 28 (difference of least square means = 24.0, SE = 1.69, 95% CI = 27.31, 20.64); likewise, clinically meaningful improvement was observed in the esketamine plus antidepressant arm at earlier time points. The five most common adverse events (dissociation, nausea, vertigo, dysgeusia, and dizziness) all were observed more frequently in the esketamine plus antidepressant arm than in the antidepressant plus placebo arm; 7% and 0.9% of patients in the respective treatment groups discontinued study drug because of an adverse event. Adverse events in the esketamine plus antidepressant arm generally appeared shortly after dosing and resolved by 1.5 hours after dosing. Conclusions: Current treatment options for treatmentresistant depression have considerable limitations in terms of efficacy and patient acceptability. Esketamine is expected to address an unmet medical need in this population through its novel mechanism of action and rapid onset of antidepressant efficacy. The study supports the efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray as a rapidly acting antidepressant for patients with treatment-resistant depression.

METHODS: Dimethyltryptamine, an endogenous mammalian hallucinogen and drug of abuse, was administered intravenously at 0.05, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.4 mg/kg to 11 experienced hallucinogen users, in a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized design. Treatments were separated by at least 1 week. RESULTS: Peak DMT blood levels and subjective effects were seen within 2 minutes after drug administration, and were negligible at 30 minutes. Dimethyltryptamine dose dependently elevated blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and rectal temperature, in addition to elevating blood concentrations of beta-endorphin, corticotropin, cortisol, and prolactin. Growth hormone blood levels rose equally in response to all doses of DMT, and melatonin levels were unaffected. Threshold doses for significant effects relative to placebo were also hallucinogenic (0.2 mg/kg and higher). Subjects with five or more exposures to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine demonstrated less robust pupil diameter effects than those with two or fewer exposures. CONCLUSIONS: Dimethyltryptamine can be administered safely to experienced hallucinogen users and dose-response data generated for several measures hypothesized under serotonergic modulatory control.

Current human research with psychedelics and entactogens has explored the possibility that drugs displaying agonist activity at the 5-HT(2A/2C) sites temporally disrupt inhibitory neural mechanisms thought to intervene in the normal filtering of information. Suppression of the P50 auditory evoked potential (AEP) and prepulse inhibition of startle (PPI) are considered operational measures of sensory (P50 suppression) and sensorimotor (PPI) gating. Contrary to findings in lower animals, unexpected increases in sensorimotor gating have been found in humans following the administration of the serotonergic psychedelic psilocybin and the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). In addition, to our knowledge P50 suppression has not been assessed previously in humans following the administration of a 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects of the acute administration of ayahuasca on P50 suppression and PPI in humans, in order to evaluate the drug's modulatory actions on these measures of sensory and sensorimotor gating. METHODS: Eighteen healthy volunteers with prior experience of psychedelic drug use participated in a clinical trial in which placebo or ayahuasca doses (0.6 mg and 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight) were administered according to a double-blind, cross-over balanced design. P50 and startle reflex (pulse-alone and 60 ms, 120 ms, 240 ms and 2000 ms prepulse-to-pulse intervals) recordings were undertaken at 1.5 h and 2 h after drug intake, respectively. RESULTS: Ayahuasca produced diverging effects on each of the two gating measures evaluated. Whereas significant dose-dependent reductions of P50 suppression were observed after ayahuasca, no significant effects were found on the startle response, its habituation rate, or on PPI at any of the prepulse-to-pulse intervals studied. CONCLUSION: The present findings indicate, at the doses tested, a decremental effect of ayahuasca on sensory gating, as measured by P50 suppression, and no distinct effects on sensorimotor gating, as measured by PPI.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-002-1237-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12474114/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

AIMS: In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. METHOD: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020.

Quantitative evidence has begun to emerge where human studies suggest that repeated recreational use of +/-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or \"Ecstasy\") produces lasting impairments in explicit memory. The purpose of this investigation was to further explore the nature and pattern of component memory processes in abstinent MDMA users. Methods. Accordingly, 15 MDMA users and 17 matched normal controls completed a brief neuropsychological test battery composed mainly of the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test (RBMT), a Stem-Completion task, and the Vocabulary subtest of the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale-III (WAIS-III). Results. MDMA users were found impaired in terms of episodic prospective memory, as medium to large effects were observed between groups on time-based Appointment and event-based Message subtests of the RBMT. The results of this study also indicate that the ability to recall a future appointment may be related to the frequency of MDMA use and the absolute number of times MDMA was used. Conclusion.

Converging lines of evidence suggest the role of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology and treatment of mood disorders. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether a rapid antidepressant effect can be achieved with an antagonist at the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor in subjects with major depression. DESIGN: A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind crossover study from November 2004 to September 2005. SETTING: Mood Disorders Research Unit at the National Institute of Mental Health. Patients Eighteen subjects with DSM-IV major depression (treatment resistant). INTERVENTIONS: After a 2-week drug-free period, subjects were given an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days, a week apart. Subjects were rated at baseline and at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes and 1, 2, 3, and 7 days postinfusion. Main Outcome Measure Changes in scores on the primary efficacy measure, the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: Subjects receiving ketamine showed significant improvement in depression compared with subjects receiving placebo within 110 minutes after injection, which remained significant throughout the following week. The effect size for the drug difference was very large (d = 1.46 [95% confidence interval, 0.91-2.01]) after 24 hours and moderate to large (d = 0.68 [95% confidence interval, 0.13-1.23]) after 1 week.

Preliminary evidence suggest giving more than one ketamine infusion may result in better clinical outcomes for treatment resistant depression (TRD) than what might be achieved with a single infusion (Murrough et al, 2012; Rasmussen et al, 2013). Most studies of ketamine infusion wash subjects out of prior medication for at least two weeks, which may be impractical in a clinical setting. Administration of multiple infusions allows the trajectory of treatment response to be examined, especially important for those subjects that do not respond after a single infusion. In this pilot study, we sought to determine whether antidepressant response and remission can be increased by completing six ketamine infusions as compared to a single infusion while continuing with stable antidepressant dosages. The study also aimed to determine the trajectories of clinical response during infusions and to estimate time to relapse among responders after completion of the six infusions. Methods: TRD subjects were defined as three or more adequate trials of an antidepressant as determined by the Antidepressant Treatment History Form criteria (score >=3). Subjects were required to have at least 2\u2010month period of stable dose of antidepressants and other medications prior to entering the study. Subjects received six IV infusions of 0.5 mg/Kg ketamine over 40 min on a Monday\u2010 Wednesday\u2010Friday schedule during a 12\u2010day period. Those who meet response criterion after the last dose of ketamine were followed for 4 consecutive weeks or until relapse towards their baseline state was observed. Response was defined as \u226550% improvement in depressive symptoms as measured by the Montgomery\u2010A\u02da sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Remission was defined as a MADRS score \u22649. Relapse was defined as o50% improvement in MADRS score at that visit compared with baseline. MADRS scores were ascertained at baseline (t0), at the end of infusion (t + 40 min), and again at t + 100 mins and t + 160 mins. Other outcome measures, all administered at the same time points as the MADRS, included self\u2010rated Visual Analog Scales (VAS) for happiness, sadness, energy, tiredness, calmness, worry, worthless and self\u2010value; four\u2010item positive symptom subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and the Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale. Hemodynamic parameters were monitored throughout the infusion and two hours post infusion. Results: Fourteen subjects were enrolled; one dropped out after the first infusion and the second after two infusions due to dissociative side effects. Out of twelve subjects who completed all six infusions, eleven (92%) achieved response criterion while eight (67%) met the remission criterion. After the first infusion, three subjects responded and one remitted. After three or more infusions, four responded and six remitted. Of the eleven patients who responded, seven relapsed within the four week followup period. The mean time to relapse after the last ketamine infusion was 16 days (range 7\u201028 days). For subjects that completed all infusions, no significant increases were observed on the positive symptom subscale of the BPRS or Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale. Conclusions: Using a six infusion protocol, 92% of subjects responded and 67% remitted. This compares favorably with prior reports from single infusion studies in which between 56\u201071% of subjects responded. Within our own sample, adding five infusions increased response from 33 to 92%. We observed two patterns of response: a fast response where subjects responded after 1\u20103 infusions, and a slow response where 4\u20106 infusions were needed to reach a clinical response. We were able to achieve response without a two week washout, making ketamine infusion for TRD easier to implement clinically.

Moreover, it was consistently shown that abstinent MDMA users have memory deficits. Recently, it was supposed that these deficits are an expression of a temporal or rather hippocampal dysfunction caused by the serotonergic neurotoxicity of MDMA. The aim of this study is to examine the memory deficits of MDMA users neuropsychologically in order to evaluate the role of different brain regions. Nineteen male abstinent MDMA users, 19 male abstinent cannabis users and 19 male drug-naive control subjects were examined with a German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test (RAVLT). MDMA users showed widespread and marked verbal memory deficits, compared to drug-naive controls as well as compared to cannabis users, whereas cannabis users did not differ from control subjects in their memory performance. MDMA users revealed impairments in learning, consolidation, recall and recognition. In addition, they also showed a worse recall consistency and strong retroactive interference whereby both measures were previously associated with frontal lobe function. There was a significant correlation between memory performance and the amount of MDMA taken.

The increasing use of LDKI as an opioid-sparing agent in multimodal analgesia requires a better understanding of its effects on the cardiovascular response, a known dose-dependent side effect of ketamine administration. We investigated the cardiovascular response of acute pain patients treated with LDKI. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of LDKI in hemodynamic variables (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) during LDKI analgesia for up to 48 hours of treatment in an acute pain setting. Secondary objectives were to evaluate psychomimetic effects. Study Design: Retrospective unicentric cohort design. Setting: The study was conducted at an academic university hospital. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who underwent LDKI to treat surgical and nonsurgical acute pain. We obtained data from the Hospital San Vicente Fundaci\u00f3n Health Documentation System database and evaluated the medical records of 318 patients with surgical and nonsurgical pain. Patients received a 0.1 mg/kg/h ketamine infusion as part of a multimodal analgesic plan. Baseline systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and HR values were compared with those measured after 24 and 48 hours of treatment. Pain level and psychomimetic effects were measured at 24 and 48 hours. Cardiovascular complications and treatment duration were also recorded. Patients with a history of psychiatric, cardiovascular, or cognitive disease were excluded from the study. This study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (identifier: NCT03979105). Results: No statistical differences in SBP, DBP, MAP, or HR were observed when baseline and post-LDKI treatment values were compared (P < 0.05). When comparing hemodynamic variables after exposure to LDKI in patients with and without hypertension, we did not observe statistically significant differences in mean HR, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, or MAP values at 24 and 48 hours. The frequency of severe pain was reduced from 72% on day 0 to 4.4% on day 1 and 6.2% on day 2 post-LDKI. Observed psychomimetic effects were confusion 4.39%, hallucinations 2.51%, and nightmares 1.25%. No major cardiovascular events were observed. Limitations: This study was limited by its retrospective design, the lack of a comparative matching cohort, and the good general condition of the majority of patients included in the study. Conclusions: LDKI (0.1 mg/kg/h) was not associated with significant changes in baseline BP or HR. Our results suggest that as an adjuvant in multimodal analgesia for surgical and nonsurgical acute pain, LDKI has a low impact on the cardiovascular response.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Pain Physician"}

METHODS: Thirty patients with TRD were enrolled and underwent eight ECT sessions with ketamine anaesthesia (0.8 mg/kg) alone. Depression severity, response and remission were evaluated using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD-17). Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to examine serum BDNF levels in patients with TRD at baseline and after the second, fourth and eighth ECT sessions.

A medical hospital admission is an opportune moment to administer this intervention. Methods: Our open\u2010label, pilot trial (target n=45\u201060) randomizes patients with alcohol use disorder (AUD) to receive extended\u2010release naltrexone, intravenous ketamine (0.5mg/kg over 40 min), or neither prior to discharge. All three study arms receive enhanced linkage to addiction clinic. We present baseline and intervention data related to those who randomize to the ketamine arm. Quantitative data include demographics, clinical characteristics, Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS, 23\u2010item version, score 0\u201092), changes in pre\u2010/post\u2010infusion vital\u2010signs and physical symptoms, and acceptability (10\u2010point Likert scale). Qualitative data are derived from an open\u2010ended reflection question asked post\u2010infusion. Results: For this abstract, the ketamine arm includes ten patients. They are 70% male with mean age 45.7 years\u2010old. Clinical characteristics: mean daily drinks 6.8, mean PHQ9 score 14.4 (of 27), median past\u2010year ED visits 9.5, with median 4.5 of those visits resulting in admission. Blood pressures temporarily increased at infusion completion. No clinically significant, immediate adverse events were observed. Mean CADSS score is 21.5. Mean pre\u2010discharge acceptability score is 9.3. Four of the five that presented in\u2010person to follow\u2010up rated acceptability as 10. Qualitative data regarding infusion experiences are presented, including direct quotations such as: \u201cit was\u2026mesmerizing.\u201d Discussion: This population appears to be high acuity in terms of depression and hospital utilization. All participants had an overall positive infusion experience along with some symptoms of dissociation. In a study of ketamine for cocaine use, Dakwar, Nunes et al. (2019) reported a median CADSS score of 22, similar to our results. Among a similar safety\u2010net patient population, Collins et al.

In recreational users, Curran & Morgan (2000) showed that ketamine produced the same acute effects but that 3 days after ingestion, ketamine users showed persisting memory impairment and elevated psychotogenic symptoms compared with controls. To explore whether such persisting effects reflect chronic effects of ketamine use, the present study compared frequent with infrequent users of ketamine on the night of drug use and again 3 days later. DESIGN AND PARTICIPANTS: Eighteen frequent and 19 infrequent ketamine users were assessed on each test day on a range of cognitive tasks tapping memory and attentional function and on subjective scales (schizotypal symptomatology, dissociation, mood). FINDINGS: Groups were broadly matched for polydrug use apart from ketamine which frequent users took significantly more often and in larger quantities than infrequent users. Acute effects on day 0 replicated previous findings. On day 3 frequent users showed significant impairments on tasks tapping episodic and semantic memory but there was no evidence of persisting dissociative or schizotypal symptoms. CONCLUSION: These findings indicate that frequent use of ketamine produces long-lasting impairments in episodic memory and aspects of retrieval from semantic memory. Such effects accord with animal evidence of the effects of NMDA receptor blockade on memory.

P300 was reduced and delayed by ketamine regardless of whether it was elicited by a target (P3b) or novel (P3a) stimulus, while nicotine only reduced the amplitude of P3a. Nicotine did not rescue P300 from the effects of ketamine; the interactions of ketamine and nicotine were not significant. While nicotine significantly reduced MMN amplitude, ketamine did not. Conclusion: Nicotine failed to modulate ketamine-induced neurophysiological and behavioral effects in this preliminary study. Interestingly, ketamine reduced P3b amplitude and nicotine reduced P3a amplitude, suggesting independent roles of NMDA receptor and nAChR in the generation of P3b and P3a, respectively.

The participation of cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 in the oxidative metabolism of MDMA may suggest an increased risk of acute toxicity in CYP2D6 poor metabolisers. This study was aimed at assessing the contribution of CYP2D6 to MDMA disposition in vivo using paroxetine as a metabolic probe inhibitor. Paroxetine, a CYP2D6 inhibitor, was repeatedly administered before MDMA administration. STUDY DESIGN: This was a randomised, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial conducted in seven healthy male volunteers who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolisers. Treatment conditions (paroxetine/MDMA and placebo/MDMA) were randomly assigned. Each volunteer participated in two 3-day sessions. On days 1, 2 and 3 subjects received a single oral dose of paroxetine or placebo 20 mg. On the third day, a single oral dose of MDMA 100 mg was administered in both paroxetine and placebo conditions. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of MDMA and its metabolites were measured, as well as plasma concentrations of paroxetine, (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3,4-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine, and (3S,4R)-4-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-(3-methoxy-4-hydroxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine (HM-paroxetine). RESULTS: Paroxetine given before MDMA resulted in significant increases of MDMA area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 27 hours (AUC(27)) [23%], AUC from zero to infinity (AUC(infinity)) [27%] and maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) [17%], without significant differences in MDMA time to reach C(max) (t(max)). MDMA elimination-related pharmacokinetic parameters showed a significant reduction of MDMA elimination rate constant (K(e)) [-14%] and plasmatic clearance (CL(P)) [-29%]. In the case of 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (HHMA), a 21% decrease in C(max) with no significant differences in AUC(27), AUC(infinity), K(e) and elimination half-life) were found. 4-Hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) showed a decrease in plasma concentrations with a reduction in AUC(27) (-28%), AUC(infinity) (-20%) and C(max) (-46%). In the case of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) an increase in C(max) (17%) and AUC(27) (16%) was found. Following paroxetine pretreatment, the urinary recovery (0-45 hours) of MDMA increased by 11%; HHMA and HMMA urinary recoveries were 27% and 16% lower, respectively compared with placebo. The ratio of C(max) values of paroxetine and its metabolite on days 1 and 3 showed a 3-fold reduction, with no differences in t(max). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: The contribution of CYP2D6 to MDMA metabolism in humans is not >30%, therefore other CYP isoenzymes may contribute to O-demethylenation of MDMA. Accordingly, the relevance of genetic polymorphism in CYP2D6 activity on MDMA effects and MDMA-induced acute toxicity should be examined as well as the interactions of other CYP2D6 substrates with MDMA, once the enzyme is inhibited.

Among 46 analysed patients, 22 (47.8%) achieved response (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score reduction \u226550.0%) and 17 (37.0%) achieved remission (MADRS total score of \u226412) at least once at a median of 18.5 (2.0-77.0) and 21.0 (2.0-46.0) days after initiation, respectively. By Week 4, patients had a 31.6% probability of achieving remission (Kaplan-Meier method). Sedation, somnolence, dizziness, hypertension, anxiety and dissociation were the most frequently reported (>10.0%) adverse events. No new safety signals were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Patient characteristics of this cohort demonstrate high-level treatment resistance. The safety and efficacy of esketamine in patients with TRD in real-world clinical practice were consistent with Phase 3 trials.Key pointsPatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) exceptionally received esketamine nasal spray ahead of its launch through a French cohort Temporary Authorisation for Use (ATUc) programme.The clinical characteristics of 66 adult patients with TRD included in this cohort demonstrated a high-level of resistance to conventional treatments at the time of treatment request prior to esketamine initiation.No new safety signals were observed with esketamine initiation during the ATUc period compared with the Phase 3 clinical trials.The safety and efficacy of esketamine in the real world remain consistent with that established in Phase 3 clinical trials.The data collected during this ATUc also provide the first real-world data on the management and practical use of esketamine in a hospital setting in France.", "doi": "10.1080/13651501.2022.2030757", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35174754/", "secondary_title": "Int J Psychiatry Clin Pract"}

The objective of this study was to determine whether opioid receptor antagonism prior to administration of intravenous ketamine attenuates its acute antidepressant or dissociative effects. METHOD: In a proposed double-blind crossover study of 30 adults with treatment-resistant depression, the authors performed a planned interim analysis after studying 14 participants, 12 of whom completed both conditions in randomized order: placebo or 50 mg of naltrexone preceding intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Response was defined as a reduction \u226550% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score on postinfusion day 1. RESULTS: In the interim analysis, seven of 12 adults with treatment-resistant depression met the response criterion during the ketamine plus placebo condition. Reductions in 6-item and 17-item HAM-D scores among participants in the ketamine plus naltrexone condition were significantly lower than those of participants in the ketamine plus placebo condition on postinfusion days 1 and 3. Secondary analysis of all participants who completed the placebo and naltrexone conditions, regardless of the robustness of response to ketamine, showed similar results. There were no differences in ketamine-induced dissociation between conditions. Because naltrexone dramatically blocked the antidepressant but not the dissociative effects of ketamine, the trial was halted at the interim analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ketamine's acute antidepressant effect requires opioid system activation. The dissociative effects of ketamine are not mediated by the opioid system, and they do not appear sufficient without the opioid effect to produce the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression.", "doi": "10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18020138", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30153752/", "secondary_title": "Am J Psychiatry"}

Development and optimization of novel interventions for these youth will require a deeper knowledge of the neurobiology of depression. A well-established phenomenon of depression is an attention bias toward negativity and away from positivity that is evidenced behaviorally and neurally, but it is unclear how symptom reduction is related to changes to this bias. Neurobiological research using a treatment probe has promise to help discover the neural changes that accompany symptom improvement. Ketamine has utility for such research because of its known rapid and strong antidepressant effects in the context of TRD. Our previous study of six open-label ketamine infusions in 11 adolescents with TRD showed variable response, ranging from full remission, partial response, non-response, or clinical worsening. In this study, we examined the performance of these participants on Word Face Stroop (WFS) fMRI task where they indicated the valence of affective words superimposed onto either congruent or incongruent emotional faces before and after the ketamine infusions. Participants also completed a clinical assessment (including measurement of depression symptomology and anhedonia/pleasure) before and after the ketamine infusions. Following ketamine treatment, better WFS performance correlated with self-reported decreased depressive symptoms and increased pleasure. Analyses of corticolimbic, corticostriatal and default mode (DMN) networks showed that across networks, decreased activation during all conditions (congruent negative, congruent positive, incongruent negative, and incongruent positive) correlated with decreases in depressive symptoms and with increases in pleasure. These findings suggest that in adolescents with TRD, clinical improvement may require an attenuation of the negativity bias and re-tuning of these three critical neural networks to attenuate DMN and limbic regions activation and allow more efficient recruitment of the reward network. Lower activation across conditions may facilitate shifting across different salient emotional stimuli rather than getting trapped in downward negative spirals.

Methods: We obtained multimodal neuroimaging in a group of healthy volunteers (n= 15) during a saline and during a ketamine infusion (0.27mg/kg bolus over 10 minutes, followed by a continuous infusion of 0.25mg/kg/hour for 50 minutes). We acquired 2D pCASL scans (TR/ TE= 5230/ 53ms, excitation flip angle= 90\u00b0, in\u2010plane resolution= 3.75\u00d7 3.75mm2, matrix= 64\u00d7 64, slice thickness= 6mm, label time 1s, delay time 1s, labeling offset 8cm) with 30 pairs of labeled and unlabeled images to measure regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) and MR spectroscopy scans in the left hippocampus (TR/TE= 2000/80ms; 1200 Hz spectral bandwidth; 1024 points; 640 averages, and 8 averages without water suppression, voxel size: 2.7x 1.5x 1cm) to measure glx (glutamate+glutamine). We examined changes in rCBF and metabolic connectivity, as well as their associations with clinical symptom severity (measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale [BPRS]) and glx levels. Results: Voxelwise analysis comparing rCBF during a saline infusion and ketamine challenge demonstrated regionally selective increases in the prefrontal, orbitofrontal and cingulate cortices as well as the insula, angular gyrus, caudate, putamen, thalamus and hippocampus. No areas showed a decrease in rCBF. Metabolic connectivity analyses revealed a complex pattern of ketamine related rCBF changes. Positive correlations between the anterior cingulate/ frontal pole and insula decreased. Negative correlations between the hippocampus and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the putamen decreased. We also found that the increase in rCBF in the bilateral putamen and left hippocampus was positively correlated with psychosis severity during the ketamine challenge while change in anterior cingulate cortex rCBF was negatively correlated with change in hippocampal Glx. Discussion: Here we find regionally selective patterns of rCBF changes, and metabolic connectivity changes at the level of large\u2010scale brain networks that are thought to be central to the schizophrenia psychopathology.

OCD is characterized by an inability to inhibit intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive behaviors (compulsions). Serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SRI) treatment of OCD exhibits a long lag time (2\u20103 months) before clinical benefit, and this benefit is typically only partial. Identifying effective, fast\u2010acting treatments will help reduce OCD morbidity and its life effects. We previously reported the rapid OCD symptom reduction of ketamine, a glutamate Nmethyl\u2010 d\u2010aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, versus saline infusions in a proof\u2010of\u2010concept crossover trial (n = 15) in unmedicated adults with OCD. Building on this initial finding, we evaluated the efficacy of ketamine in a larger group of unmedicated OCD patients with improved control conditions (active placebo control condition). Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial of a single infusion of ketamine compared to an active placebo condition (midazolam, an anesthetic). With institutional review board approval, unmedicated adult patients (age 18\u201065) with OCD were randomly assigned under double\u2010blind conditions to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) in a 2:1 ratio (total n = 45). Participants met DSM\u20105 criteria for OCD with at least moderate symptoms (Yale\u2010Brown Obsessive Compulsive Rating Scale score of at least 16). Exclusion criteria included severe depression (17\u2010item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was less or equal to 18 to enter the study) and comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that made participation unsafe. The primary outcome was change in OCD severity 1 week after drug administration, as assessed by the Y\u2010BOCS. Duration of effect was explored with weekly Y\u2010BOCS up to 4 weeks post\u2010infusion. We focused on estimating intention to treat effects based on longitudinal mixed effects modeling. For both moderator and mediator investigation, we employed the MacArthur approach embedded in mixed effects modeling. Results: Regarding the primary outcome, the ketamine group had significantly greater improvement in Y\u2010BOCS score than the midazolam group 1 week after treatment (Cohen's d= 1.25, p < 0.001). The effects from a single intravenous infusion of ketamine persist up to 3 weeks post\u2010infusion (Cohen's d= 0.59, p = 0.007), gradually reducing each week and then becoming insignificant by Week 4. We examined age, sex, and race as potential moderators of treatment effects, although none were identified as significant moderators. We also examined change in dissociation as a potential mediator of treatment effect, although it did not turn out to be a significant mediator. Conclusions: To our knowledge, this is the largest clinical trial to date of ketamine in unmedicated OCD patients. Ketamine demonstrated rapid and durable OCD symptom improvement compared to the active control condition. By using an optimized active placebo design to control for nonspecific anesthetic effects, this study provides new supporting evidence for the specific OCD therapeutic effects of ketamine.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-022-01485-0", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36456694/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Functional seizures are known, in part, to have psychological underpinnings; however, the lack of effective and consistent treatment options requires research and novel approaches to better understand the etiology, diagnosis and what constitutes a successful intervention. Ketamine, a selective blocker of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has a well-established safety and efficacy profile. In recent years, ketamine-assisted therapy has shown increasing potential for treating a broad range of psychiatric conditions, building on its demonstrated rapid-acting antidepressant effects.

Many patients remain refractory to treatment in many symptom domains, notably with cognitive deficits. We and others have recently shown psilocybin treatment (careful patient preparation followed by 1\u20103 administrations of psilocybin under closely monitored conditions) to greatly reduce depression severity in patients with depression and anxiety secondary to a cancer diagnosis, as well as patients with treatment resistant depression. However, the enduring effects of psilocybin on cognition and the neurobiological correlates of affective dysfunction that are associated with MDD have not yet been determined.

Three weeks before session 1, and 1 and 4 weeks after session 2, a subset of patients (N = 18) completed behavioral measures of cognitive flexibility (the Penn Conditional Exclusion Task, or PCET) and verbal reasoning (the Penn Verbal Learning Test). Three weeks before session 1 and 1 week after session 2, a subset of patients also completed neuroimaging measurements including proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) of the anterior cingulate (N = 10), right hippocampus (N = 10), and left hippocampus (N = 7), and an amygdala reactivity task (N = 12) during measurement of blood\u2010oxygenation level\u2010dependent (BOLD) signal. In the amygdala reactivity task, patients matched one of two emotional facial expressions on the bottom of a display with a target emotional facial expression at the top of a display. Matching of vertical and horizontal ellipsoids was used as a control condition. Imaging data were collected with a Philips 7T MRI, with BOLD data collected using a 3D T2\u2010prep sequence that corrects for field inhomogeneity distortions encountered at 7T, and with MRS data collected using a short\u2010TE (13ms) point\u2010resolved spectroscopy (PRESS) pulse sequence. Results: One week after psilocybin session 2, compared to 3 weeks before session 1: (1) glutamate increased in the right hippocampus (d = 0.59) and decreased in the anterior cingulate cortex (d = 0.53); and (2) BOLD response to negative affective stimuli decreased in the amygdala (t = 2.01, p[FWE] = 0.026, d = 0.61). Cognitive flexibility also improved, with greater accuracy on the PCET 1 week (t = 2.07, p = 0.045) and 4 weeks (t = 2.51, p = 0.016) after psilocybin session 2 compared to 3 weeks before session 1 (f2 effect of time = 0.34).

Findings: We saw significant effects of group and group by sex (p=0.041 and p=0.022, respectively) on overall [123I]\u03b2-CIT binding ratios. In heavy MDMA users, significant decreases in overall binding ratios were seen in women (p<0.01) but not men (p=0.587). In female ex-MDMA users, overall densities of serotonin transporters were significantly higher than in heavy MDMA users (p=0.004), but not higher than in controls (p=0.524). Interpretation: Our results indicate that heavy use of MDMA is associated with neurotoxic effects on serotonin neurons, that women might be more susceptible than men, and that MDMA-induced neurotoxic changes in several brain regions of female ex-MDMA users are reversible.", "doi": "10.1016/S0140-6736(01)06888-X", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11741626/", "secondary_title": "Lancet"}

Analysis of LSD represents a major challenge in forensic toxicology due to its instability, low drug concentrations, and short detection windows in biological samples. A new, fast, and sensitive microflow liquid chromatography (MFLC) tandem mass spectrometry method for the validated quantification of LSD, iso-LSD, 2-oxo 3-hydroxy-LSD (oxo-HO-LSD), and N-desmethyl-LSD (nor-LSD) was developed in plasma and applied to a controlled pharmacokinetic (PK) study in humans to test whether LSD metabolites would offer for longer detection windows. Five hundred microlitres of plasma were extracted by solid phase extraction. Analysis was performed on a Sciex Eksigent MFLC system coupled to a Sciex 5500 QTrap. The method was validated according to (inter)-national guidelines. MFLC allowed for separation of the mentioned analytes within 3\u2009minutes and limits of quantification of 0.01\u2009ng/mL. Validation criteria were fulfilled for all analytes. PK data could be calculated for LSD, iso-LSD, and oxo-HO-LSD in all participants. Additionally, hydroxy-LSD (HO-LSD) and HO-LSD glucuronide could be qualitatively detected and PK determined in 11 and 8 subjects, respectively. Nor-LSD was only sporadically detected. Elimination half-lives of iso-LSD (median 12\u2009h) and LSD metabolites (median 9, 7.4, 12, and 11\u2009h for oxo-HO-LSD, HO-LSD, HO-LSD-gluc, and nor-LSD, respectively) exceeded those of LSD (median 4.2\u2009h). However, screening for metabolites to increase detection windows in plasma seems not to be constructive due to their very low concentrations.

Theories regarding psychological processes involved in psychedelic therapy remain underdeveloped. METHOD: Participants (N = 13) mostly identified as non-Hispanic and White, with approximately equal proportions of cisgender men and women. Participants engaged in semistructured interviews about their subjective experiences in the study. Questions probed the nature of participants' drinking before and after the study as well as coping patterns in response to strong emotions, stress, and cravings for alcohol. Verbatim transcripts were coded using Dedoose software, and content was analyzed with interpretive phenomenological analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported that the psilocybin treatment helped them process emotions related to painful past events and helped promote states of self-compassion, self-awareness, and feelings of interconnectedness. The acute states during the psilocybin sessions were described as laying the foundation for developing more self-compassionate regulation of negative affect. Participants also described newfound feelings of belonging and an improved quality of relationships following the treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results support the assertion that psilocybin increases the malleability of self-related processing, and diminishes shame-based and self-critical thought patterns while improving affect regulation and reducing alcohol cravings. These findings suggest that psychosocial treatments that integrate self-compassion training with psychedelic therapy may serve as a useful tool for enhancing psychological outcomes in the treatment of AUD.

Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 \u03bcg/kg vs placebo) on both \u03b1 oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital \u03b1 power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced \u03b1 power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of \u03b1 oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease.", "doi": "10.1523/jneurosci.3007-12.2013", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23785166/", "secondary_title": "J Neurosci"}

Primary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD. Non-cognitive adverse events, mortality and length of stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence (GRADE approach) was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration. Risk ratios were calculated for binary outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. We planned to explore the effects of age, specific anaesthesia regimen, depth of anaesthesia and intraoperative haemodynamic events through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included. The incidence of postoperative delirium did not differ between groups (4 trials, 557 patients, RR 0.83, 95% CI [0.25, 2.80]), but patients receiving ketamine seemed at lower risk of POCD (3 trials, 163 patients, RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15, 0.73]).

In humans, individual studies of methamphetamine and MDMA indicate that the drugs engender overlapping and divergent effects; there are only limited data comparing the two drugs in the same individuals. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA using a within-subject design. METHODS: Eleven adult volunteers completed this 13-day residential laboratory study, which consisted of four 3-day blocks of sessions. On the first day of each block, participants received oral methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), MDMA (100 mg), or placebo. Drug plasma concentrations, cardiovascular, subjective, and cognitive/psychomotor performance effects were assessed before drug administration and after. Food intake and sleep were also assessed. On subsequent days of each block, placebo was administered and residual effects were assessed. RESULTS: Acutely, both drugs increased cardiovascular measures and \"positive\" subjective effects and decreased food intake. In addition, when asked to identify each drug, participants had difficulty distinguishing between the amphetamines. The drugs also produced divergent effects: methamphetamine improved performance and disrupted sleep, while MDMA increased \"negative\" subjective-effect ratings. Few residual drug effects were noted for either drug. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the differences observed could explain the differential public perception and abuse potential associated with these amphetamines. Alternatively, the route of administration by which the drugs are used recreationally might account for the many of the effects attributed to these drugs (i.e., MDMA is primarily used orally, whereas methamphetamine is used by routes associated with higher abuse potential).", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-011-2383-4", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21713605/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

While MDMA has been shown to produce neurotoxicity in animal models, research on its potential neurotoxic effects in humans is inconclusive and has focused primarily on the serotonin system. Methods: We investigated 34 regular, largely pure MDMA users for signs of premature neurodegenerative processes in the form of increased iron load in comparison to a group of 36 age-, sex-, and education-matched MDMA-na\u00efve control subjects. We used quantitative susceptibility mapping, a novel tool able to detect even small tissue (nonheme) iron accumulations. Cortical and relevant subcortical gray matter structures were grouped into 8 regions of interest and analyzed. Results: Significantly increased iron deposition in the striatum was evident in the MDMA user group. The effect survived correction for multiple comparisons and remained after controlling for relevant confounding factors, including age, smoking, and stimulant co-use. Although no significant linear relationship between measurements of the amounts of MDMA intake (hair analysis and self-reports) and quantitative susceptibility mapping values was observed, increased striatal iron deposition might nevertheless point to MDMA-induced neurotoxic processes. Additional factors (hyperthermia and simultaneous co-use of other substances) that possibly amplify neurotoxic effects of MDMA during the state of acute intoxication are discussed. Conclusions: The demonstrated increased striatal iron accumulation may indicate that regular MDMA users have an increased risk potential for neurodegenerative diseases with progressing age.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsc.2023.02.005", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36848948/", "secondary_title": "Biological Psychiatry: Cognitive Neuroscience and Neuroimaging"}

New treatment options for TRD patients are needed. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching adult patients with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they had not responded) to intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms. Methods: This was a Phase 3, double\u2010blind, active\u2010controlled, multicenter study (NCT02418585) using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, and the United States from August 2015 to June 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate\u2010to\u2010severe, non\u2010psychotic, recurrent or persistent (single episode) depression, and history of non\u2010response to \u22652 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with 1 of them assessed prospectively. The non\u2010responders to standard\u2010of\u2010care treatment were randomized (1:1) to flexibly\u2010dosed intranasal esketamine (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) and a new oral antidepressant (given daily) or to a new oral antidepressant and intranasal placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint \u2013 change from baseline to endpoint (day 28) in Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score \u2013 was assessed among patients who received \u22651 dose of (intranasal and oral) study medication by a mixed\u2010effects model using repeated measures. Remission rate, a secondary endpoint, was assessed using Generalized Cochran\u2010Mantel\u2010Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for country and class of oral antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) as a post hoc analysis. Results: 435 patients were screened, 227 randomized, and 197 completed the double\u2010blind period. Change (LS mean [SE] difference vs. placebo) in MADRS total score with intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant was superior to oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo at day 28 (\u20104.0 [1.69], 95% CI: \u20107.31, \u20100.64; 1\u2010sided p=0.010), as well as at earlier timepoints (1\u2010sided p\u22640.009 at 24 hours postdose and days 8 and 22). Remission rate (MADRS total score \u226412) at day 28 was 52.5% (53/101) and 31.0% (31/100) for the respective groups (1\u2010sided p=0.001), with the number needed to treat (NNT) (95% CI) for remission of 5 (1.8; 7.5). The most common adverse events reported for the esketamine plus oral antidepressant group were dysgeusia, nausea, vertigo, and dizziness; the incidence of each (20.9\u201026.1%) was >2\u2010fold higher than for the oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo group. Conclusions: Robust efficacy of intranasal esketamine and superiority to an active comparator were demonstrated on the primary efficacy endpoint result. More than half of the esketamine\u2010treated TRD patients achieved remission by the 4\u2010week endpoint. Favorable safety and tolerability of intranasal esketamine reported in this study suggest a positive risk\u2010benefit profile of intranasal esketamine.

MDMA users consistently exhibit memory dysfunction but there is an ongoing debate if these deficits are induced mainly by alterations in the prefrontal or mediotemporal cortex, especially the hippocampus. Thus, we investigated the relation of verbal memory deficits with alterations of regional cerebral brain glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) in recreational MDMA users.Methods:Brain glucose metabolism in rest was assessed using 2-deoxy-2-(18F)fluoro-D-glucose positron emission tomography (18FDG PET) in 19 male recreational users of MDMA and 19 male drug-na\u00efve controls. 18FDG PET data were correlated with memory performance assessed with a German version of the Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test.Results:As previously shown, MDMA users showed significant impairment in verbal declarative memory performance. PET scans revealed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral dorsolateral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex, bilateral thalamus, right hippocampus, right precuneus, right cerebellum, and pons (at the level of raphe nuclei) of MDMA users. Among MDMA users, learning and recall were positively correlated with rMRGlu predominantly in bilateral frontal and parietal brain regions, while recognition was additionally related to rMRGlu in the right mediotemporal and bihemispheric lateral temporal cortex. Moreover, cumulative lifetime dose of MDMA was negatively correlated with rMRGlu in the left dorsolateral and bilateral orbital and medial PFC, left inferior parietal and right lateral temporal cortex.Conclusions:Verbal learning and recall deficits of recreational MDMA users are correlated with glucose hypometabolism in prefrontal and parietal cortex, while word recognition was additionally correlated with mediotemporal hypometabolism. We conclude that memory deficits of MDMA users arise from combined fronto-parieto-mediotemporal dysfunction. \u00a9 2013 Bosch et al.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0061234", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23585882/", "secondary_title": "PLoS ONE"}

We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHOD: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders who presented with clinically significant SI (n = 24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. SI measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 h post-treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale--Suicidal Ideation (MADRS-SI) score at 24 h and additional measures beyond the 24-h time-point. RESULTS: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7-day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 h (p = 0.32); however, a significant difference emerged at 48 h (p = 0.047). MADRS-SI score was lower in the ketamine group compared to midazolam group at 24 h (p = 0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7-day assessment period.

This effect may be more prominent in subjects with a pre-existing mood disturbance who may use ecstasy more frequently as a 'self-medication'. This study compared depressive symptoms and the immediate effects of ecstasy on mood in subjects with (WP) and without (NP) a predisposition to depression. METHODS: Current ecstasy users were assessed using the profile of mood states (POMS) and beck depression inventory (BDI) when drug-free, and during social gathering, when 20 subjects voluntarily consumed ecstasy (ecstasy group) and 20 abstained from ecstasy (control group). Predisposition to depression was determined using the Brief Symptom Inventory. During social gathering, POMS and BDI were administered 60 min after ecstasy consumption, or at matched time for controls. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) exposure was confirmed using saliva samples collected 60 min after pill ingestion. RESULTS: There was no difference in ecstasy use patterns between the groups. When drug-free, the WP subjects had greater mood disturbance and depressive symptoms than the NP group (POMS: NP 5.85\u00b11.63, WP 14.5\u00b12.81, p<0.05, BDI: NP 4.9\u00b10.86, WP 11.2\u00b11.65, p<0.01). During social gathering, WP subjects who consumed ecstasy reported a significant decrease in depressive symptoms (F(1,35)=5.47, p<0.05).

METHODS: Following a systematic review of the literature, data were extracted from 21 studies (n\u2009=\u2009437 receiving ketamine) and analysed at four post-infusion time points (4\u2009h, 24\u2009h, 7\u2009days and 12-14\u2009days). The moderating effects of several factors were assessed including: repeat/single infusion, diagnosis, open-label/participant-blind infusion, pre-post/placebo-controlled design and the sex of patients. RESULTS: Effect sizes were significantly larger for repeat than single infusion at 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h and 7\u2009days. For single infusion studies, effect sizes were large and significant at 4\u2009h, 24\u2009h and 7\u2009days. The percentage of males was a predictor of antidepressant response at 7\u2009days. Effect sizes for open-label and participant-blind infusions were not significantly different at any time point. CONCLUSIONS: Single ketamine infusions elicit a significant antidepressant effect from 4\u2009h to 7\u2009days; the small number of studies at 12-14\u2009days post infusion failed to reach significance.

Several adult studies have investigated the association between ketamine's acute dissociative effects and depression response, but no studies have examined the association in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Methods: We conducted a secondary data analysis of 16 adolescent participants who participated in a randomized, single-dose, midazolam-controlled crossover trial of ketamine in adolescents with depression. We examined the association between the acute dissociative symptoms (measured at 60 minutes following start of infusion using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS], and its three subscales: depersonalization, derealization, amnesia) and response and depression symptom improvement at 1'day (using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale). Results: Within the ketamine group, there were no significant associations between dissociation symptoms or CADSS subscale scores and magnitude of depression symptom improvement or likelihood of ketamine response. When receiving midazolam, there was no significant association between overall dissociation symptoms and magnitude or likelihood of response of depressive symptoms. Higher levels of symptoms on the 'depersonalization' CADSS subscale when receiving midazolam were associated with less improvement in depression symptoms at 1 day following infusion. Conclusions: In contrast to some adult literature, the current data do not show a relationship between acute dissociative effects and antidepressant response to ketamine in pediatric patients with TRD. Interpretation may be limited by the small sample size, reducing the power to detect small or medium associations. Future research should utilize larger samples to more definitively measure the magnitude of association between acute dissociative symptoms and later antidepressant response to ketamine and to assess the relationship to trial design (e.g., crossover vs. parallel trial, comparison condition utilized and number of infusions) within both adult and pediatric populations.

Many individuals do not respond to first-line therapeutic options, resulting in treatment-resistant bipolar depression (B-TRD). Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, has recently been approved for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), but no data are available on its use in B-TRD. OBJECTIVES: To compare the efficacy of esketamine in two samples of unipolar and bipolar TRD, providing preliminary indications of its effectiveness in B-TRD. Secondary outcomes included the evaluation of the safety and tolerability of esketamine in B-TRD, focusing on the average risk of an affective switch.

Anamnestic data and psychometric assessments (Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale/MADRS, Hamilton-depression scale/HAM-D, Hamilton-anxiety scale/HAM-A) were collected at baseline (T0), at one month (T1), and three months (T2) follow up. RESULTS: A significant reduction in depressive symptoms was found at T1 and T2 compared to T0, with no significant differences in response or remission rates between subjects with B-TRD and TRD. Esketamine showed a greater anxiolytic action in subjects with B-TRD than in those with TRD. Improvement in depressive symptoms was not associated with treatment-emergent affective switch.

The serotonin 2A receptor critically mediates these effects by altering distributed neural processes that manifest as increased entropy, reduced functional connectivity (FC) within discrete brain networks (i.e., reduced integrity) and increased FC between networks (i.e., reduced segregation). Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive peroral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magneticresonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying profound perceptual experiences evoked by this emerging transnosological therapeutic and implicate the expression of network integrity and segregation in the psychedelic experience and consciousness.

Baseline disease and demographic characteristics of North American subjects were compared to those of subjects from the rest of world (ROW). Regional differences were assessed using ANOVA models or the Cochran\u2010Mantel\u2010Haenszel (CMH) test without multiplicity adjustment. Results: 122 randomized North American subjects with MDD and active suicidal ideation with intent received either ESK + SoC (n = 65) or PBO + SoC (n = 55); 121 (99%) were from U.S.\u2010based clinical trial sites and 94 (77%) completed the double\u2010blind phase. The clinical trial population from ROW encompassed a total of randomized 328 subjects from 19 countries from Europe, Asia and South America, 268 (82%) of whom completed the double\u2010blind phase. With respect to subject demographics data, North American subjects were younger (mean age in years (SD) 36.6 (13.54) vs 41.4(12.56), p = 0.0004) and had a larger average body mass index (BMI) than patients from ROW (mean kg/m2 (SD) 28.7 (7.57) vs 26.7(6.53), p = 0.0070). At baseline, mean MADRS total scores of North American subjects were similar to those of subjects from ROW (40.6 vs 40.3, respectively). A greater proportion of North American subjects experienced \u2265 6 episodes of MDD over the course of their lifetime (12.5% vs 30.9%) and similarly a greater proportion had a longer duration of their current episode (mean months (SD): 59.7(75.97) vs. 34.6 (59.14), p < 0.001). Compared to the ROW, a greater proportion of North American subjects reported thinking about suicide \"very often\" (50.4% vs 36.0%,) and a greater proportion reported \"severe\" intensity of suicidal thoughts (61.8% vs 48.2%) at screening. North American patients receiving ESK + SoC showed significant improvement in MADRS total score vs PBO + SoC at 24\u2010hours after first dose\u201021.3 vs\u201014.8; LS\u2010mean [SE] difference:\u20106.9 (95% CI\u201010.61;\u20103.18) and at Day 25 (\u201026.7 vs\u201021.8; LS\u2010mean [SE] difference:\u20105.9 (95% CI\u20109.91;\u20101.85). Conclusions: North American subjects, enrolled in these clinical trials, appear to have some disease characteristics suggestive of a more chronic illness and greater frequency and intensity on some measures of suicidal thinking at screening than subjects from the ROW. ESK + SoC treatment was efficacious in rapidly reducing depressive symptoms in patients with MDD with active suicidal ideation and intent in a North American\u2010based population. Further characterization and treatment outcomes of this patient population will be explored and reported.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-019-0545-y", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31801976/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

One popular view claims that these benefits are mediated by the subjective experiences induced by these substances. Based on this, we designed a virtual reality experience, Psyrreal, that mimics the phenomenological components of psychedelic experiences. AIMS: We aimed to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of Psyrreal and psychedelic VR experiences in treating depressive symptoms as well as explore the effect of Psyrreal on subjective factors which have been suggested to mediate the therapeutic benefits of psychedelics. METHODS: In this open-label feasibility study, thirteen participants with mild-to-moderate depression underwent a 2-day therapeutic intervention implementing Psyrreal. Depressive symptoms were evaluated by the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q2) at the start of the intervention and 2 weeks after. A thematic analysis of semi-structured interviews after Psyrreal was also conducted as an additional assessment of the method. RESULTS: A 2-day intervention implementing Psyrreal led to significant decreases in depressive symptoms at the 2-week follow-up (n = 10, p = 0.007, Hedges' g = 1.046) measured by the Emotional State Questionnaire (EST-Q2). The analysis of semi-structured interviews suggests that Psyrreal could lead to insight and alterations in the sense of self in some people. CONCLUSION: This work proposes a novel method using virtual reality to augment the treatment of psychological disorders as well as to precisely investigate the mediating subjective factors of the therapeutic effects of psychedelic substances. Our preliminary results suggest that VR experiences combined with psychological support show potential in treating depressive symptoms and further research into similar methods is warranted.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2023.1088896", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36937731/", "secondary_title": "Front Psychiatry"}

METHODS: This was an uncontrolled open-label study in 20 patients who had been responders in an ascending dose ketamine study. The study was undertaken in a university clinic. Patients received one or two weekly ketamine doses of 1\u2009mg/kg injected subcutaneously for 3\u2009months. Data were collected from December 2015-June 2017. RESULTS: There were 10 women (50%) and 10 men (50%); 15 patients (75%) met criteria for GAD and 18 (90%) for SAD. One hour after dosing, Fear Questionnaire ratings decreased by ~50%, as did Hamilton Anxiety ratings. Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale mean scores declined over time, from 20 points at week\u20091 to 8.8 points at week 14. Compared with pre-dose values, mean systolic and diastolic blood pressure increased by ~10\u2009mm\u2009Hg at 30\u2009min. The most common adverse events were nausea, dizziness and blurred vision. Of the 20 patients, 18 reported improved social functioning and/or work functioning during maintenance treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Weekly ketamine dosing was safe and well tolerated, and post-dose dissociative symptoms tended to reduce after repeated dosing. Patients reported marked improvements in functionality and in their personal lives. Maintenance ketamine may be a therapeutic alternative for patients with treatment refractory GAD/SAD.

In this review, we exploit the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) transdiagnostic framework, to synthesize extant literature on psilocybin. OBJECTIVE: We aimed to identify RDoC-based effects of psilocybin and vistas for future mechanistic and interventional research. METHODS: A systematic search in electronic databases (i.e., PubMed, Scopus, PsycINFO, and Web of Science) performed in January and February 2021 identified English articles published between 1990 and 2020 reporting the effects of psilocybin on mental health measures. Data from included articles were retrieved and organized according to the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix and its constituent six main domains, namely: positive valence systems, negative valence systems, cognitive systems, social processes, sensorimotor systems, and arousal and regulatory systems. RESULTS: The preponderance of research with psilocybin has differentially reported beneficial effects on positive valence systems, negative valence system, and social process domains. The data from the included studies support both short-term (23 assessments) and long-term (15 assessments) beneficial effects of psilocybin on the positive valence systems. While 12 of the extracted outcome measures suggest that psilocybin use is associated with increases in the \"fear\" construct of the negative valence systems domain, 19 findings show no significant effects on this construct, and seven parameters show lowered levels of the \"sustained threat\" construct in the long term. Thirty-four outcome measures revealed short-term alterations in the social systems' construct namely, \"perception and understanding of self,\" and \"social communications\" as well as enhancements in \"perception and understanding of others\" and \"affiliation and attachment\". The majority of findings related to the cognitive systems' domain reported dyscognitive effects. There have been relatively few studies reporting outcomes of psilocybin on the remaining RDoC domains. Moreover, seven of the included studies suggest the transdiagnostic effects of psilocybin. The dashboard characterization of RDoC outcomes with psilocybin suggests beneficial effects in the measures of reward, threat, and arousal, as well as general social systems. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin possesses a multi-domain effectiveness. The field would benefit from highly rigorous proof-of-mechanism research to assess the effects of psilocybin using the RDoC framework. The combined effect of psilocybin with psychosocial interventions with RDoC-based outcomes is a priority therapeutic vista.", "doi": "10.1007/s40263-022-00944-y", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36097251/", "secondary_title": "CNS Drugs"}

After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I\u2010II patients aged 30\u201050 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 \u201010 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16\u2010gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2 saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a 25\u2010gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2\u20103 or L3\u20104 interspaces. Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30 patients each: \u2010 The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5\u00b5g of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. \u2010 The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally. \u2010 Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5\u00b5g of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5\u20102 \u00b5g/kg, propofol 2\u20103 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis\u2010atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1\u2010 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis\u2010atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 \u00b5g/kg and atropine 20 \u00b5g/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative. VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by patient\u2010controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS \u2265 3) followed by 1 mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient\u2010care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required.

The aim of this study is to present patterns of polydrug use among a sample of the general population of young males in Piedmont (Northern Italy), focusing particularly on ecstasy consumption. A cross sectional study was carried out between September and November 1998 on a continuous sample of 3274 18-year-old conscripts. A self-administered anonymous questionnaire on socio-demographic characteristics and substances use was submitted during routine tests. Results showed that the overall lifetime prevalence of drug use is 36.6%; prevalence of polydrug use is 30% and the more frequently associated drugs are LSD, cocaine, inhalants and ecstasy. One hundred and forty five (4.6%) subjects reported having taken ecstasy at least once in their life; 20 of the 145 (13.8%) suffered from negative effects and three (2%) presented to a hospital or to a physician. The risk of ever taking ecstasy is inversely related to father's education, with a trend that is quite similar to that of heroin consumption but that is different from the trend for cannabis. In conclusion the four major results of this study are: (i) a prevalence of drug consumption similar to other European estimates, with a clear tendency to polydrug use; (ii) for ecstasy, a very high association rate with other substances; (iii) the moderately high prevalence of self-reported symptoms, and (iv) a social distribution of use similar to the one observed for heroin.

Understanding the interrelation and time point specificity of ketamine-induced changes of brain circuitry and metabolism is thus key to future therapeutic developments. We investigated the correlation of late glutamatergic changes with FC changes seeded from the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC) and tested the prediction of the latter by acute fractional amplitude of low-frequency fluctuations (fALFF).

Previous studies have found that both mindfulness and psychedelics like psilocybin modulate neural activity and connectivity of the same brain network. However, little is known about the potential interactions between mindfulness meditation and psychedelics. The indigenous plant preparation \"Ayahuasca\" is particularly interesting for the combination with mindfulness meditation. It contains two components, N,N\u2010dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine, which are very similar to the body's own messenger substance serotonin and increase its effect in the body. The investigators would now like to find out how these corresponding networks change in experienced meditators after DMT/Harmine\u2010enhanced mindfulness meditation and how this affects their subjective experience. For this functional MRI imaging will be performed, as well as psychometric assessments and detailed experiential interviews before and after a three\u2010day meditation retreat. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group receives DMT and harmine during the sitting meditation on the second day, the other group receives a corresponding placebo.

Ayahuasca ingestion is a central feature in several Brazilian syncretic churches that have expanded their activities to urban Brazil, Europe and North America. Members of these groups typically ingest ayahuasca at least twice per month. Prior research has shown that acute ayahuasca increases blood flow in prefrontal and temporal brain regions and that it elicits intense modifications in thought processes, perception and emotion. However, regular ayahuasca use does not seem to induce the pattern of addiction-related problems that characterize drugs of abuse. To study the impact of repeated ayahuasca use on general psychological well-being, mental health and cognition, here we assessed personality, psychopathology, life attitudes and neuropsychological performance in regular ayahuasca users (n = 127) and controls (n = 115) at baseline and 1 year later. Controls were actively participating in non-ayahuasca religions. Users showed higher Reward Dependence and Self-Transcendence and lower Harm Avoidance and Self-Directedness.

OBJECTIVES: Here, we report on safety and efficacy outcomes for up to 6\u00a0months in an open-label trial of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Twenty patients (six females) with (mostly) severe, unipolar, treatment-resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 and 25\u00a0mg, 7\u00a0days apart) in a supportive setting. Depressive symptoms were assessed from 1\u00a0week to 6\u00a0months post-treatment, with the self-rated QIDS-SR16 as the primary outcome measure. RESULTS: Treatment was generally well tolerated. Relative to baseline, marked reductions in depressive symptoms were observed for the first 5\u00a0weeks post-treatment (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a02.2 at week 1 and 2.3 at week 5, both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001); nine and four patients met the criteria for response and remission at week 5. Results remained positive at 3 and 6\u00a0months (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a01.5 and 1.4, respectively, both p\u00a0<\u00a00.001). No patients sought conventional antidepressant treatment within 5\u00a0weeks of psilocybin. Reductions in depressive symptoms at 5\u00a0weeks were predicted by the quality of the acute psychedelic experience. CONCLUSIONS: Although limited conclusions can be drawn about treatment efficacy from open-label trials, tolerability was good, effect sizes large and symptom improvements appeared rapidly after just two psilocybin treatment sessions and remained significant 6\u00a0months post-treatment in a treatment-resistant cohort.

Ketamine is an anesthetic gaining attention for its rapid antidepressant effect. Numerous randomized controlled trials have investigated the effect of ketamine anesthesia in ECT on various clinical outcomes. Previous systematic reviews have not found benefit for overall depression response, although some have found evidence of benefit early in the ECT course. Clear quantitative conclusions have not been established regarding other outcomes, particularly while only using data from high-quality studies. We aimed to examine all data from double-blind randomized controlled trials comparing ketamine to other anesthetics via meta-analysis, to make recommendations regarding ECT practice and future research. Data were extracted for depressive symptoms, seizure duration and electrical dose, neuropsychological performance, and adverse effects. Effect sizes were calculated using Hedge's g and odds ratios. Eighteen studies (n = 915) were included in the meta-analysis. Ketamine was not found to enhance improvement of depressive symptoms, either early in ECT course or at end of study. Ketamine had a large effect on increasing seizure duration both overall (Hedge's g = 0.71, P = 0.038) and in the subgroup receiving ketamine in combination with another anesthetic (Hedge's g = 0.78, P < 0.01), and on decreasing electrical dose (Hedge's g = 1.98, P = 0.039). There was no significant effect of ketamine on any individual neuropsychological domain. Ketamine was not associated with increased adverse effects, except for hypertension in patients receiving ketamine monotherapy. Significant heterogeneity was present for many outcomes, and sensitivity analyses suggested a relation to methodological variation in most cases. This study supports the finding that ketamine does not enhance ECT's antidepressant effect, including on early improvement, but provides substantial evidence for enhancing seizure duration and reducing electrical dose. No significant benefit was found on neurocognitive outcomes, but analysis was limited by small sample sizes and high heterogeneity. Ketamine is generally safe in ECT, particularly as a coanesthetic. Our findings provide meta-analytic support to the recommendations in ECT clinical guidelines for use of coadjuvant ketamine in ECT where seizures are suboptimal.

This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub\u2010hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms.

The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World\u2010Medical\u2010 Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within\u2010subject factor; additional within\u2010subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category. Partial eta squared (partial \u03b72) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude, and it is based on Cohen's f, which defines small, medium, and large as respectively 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50, which corresponds to partial \u03b72 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14. Results: GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency (F3,69 = 0.65, p = 0.59, partial \u03b72 = 0.03), Elaboration (F3,69 = 0.09, p = 0.99, partial \u03b72 = 0.004), Flexibility (F3,69 = 2.30, p = 0.08, partial \u03b72 = 0.09), Originality (F3,69 = 0.28, p = 0.84, partial \u03b72 = 0.01), and Ra io (F3,66 = 0.17, p = 0.92, partial \u03b72 = 0.01). RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial \u03b72 = 0.05) on rater\u2010scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial \u03b72 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial \u03b72 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial \u03b72 = 0.05) on the self\u2010rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post\u2010administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg, respectively. Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration, when the Story Writing Task was performed, were 69 (21), 137 (57), and 258 (112) pg/mL after the 5, 10, and 20 \u03bcg dose, respectively. Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task\u2010based or self\u2010rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo\u2010controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-021-01238-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857906/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Acutely, ketamine increases extracellular glutamate levels, neuronal excitability, and spontaneous \u03b3 oscillations, but it is unknown whether these effects are key to the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine. METHODS: Twenty drug-free major depressive disorder patients received a single, open-label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg). Magnetoencephalographic recordings were made approximately 3 days before and approximately 6.5 hours after the infusion, whereas patients passively received tactile stimulation to the right and left index fingers and also while they rested (eyes-closed). Antidepressant response was assessed by percentage change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores. RESULTS: Patients with robust improvements in depressive symptoms 230 min after infusion (responders) exhibited increased cortical excitability within this antidepressant response window. Specifically, we found that stimulus-evoked somatosensory cortical responses increase after infusion, relative to pretreatment responses in responders but not in treatment nonresponders. Spontaneous somatosensory cortical \u03b3-band activity during rest did not change within the same timeframe after ketamine in either responders or nonresponders. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest NMDAR antagonism does not lead directly to increased cortical excitability hours later and thus might not be sufficient for therapeutic effects of ketamine to take hold. Rather, increased cortical excitability as depressive symptoms improve is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced non-NMDAR-mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission via synaptic potentiation is central to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.03.029", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22521148/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry"}

Attempts to understand its therapeutic mechanism have largely focused on biological and dissociative effects. However, recent studies with ketamine and serotonergic psychedelics suggest that anxiety and positive affect during psychoactive periods may be relevant to clinical outcomes. Methods: We did a mediation analysis using a linear mixed effects model of clinician and self\u2010ratings of 76 patients\u2019 experiences during ketamine infusions across two randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover trials.

Most of the neurophysiological examinations published deal with ketamine as a single anaesthetic agent, although it has been suggested to that psychomimetic side-effects and haemodynamic deterioration could be avoided by combining ketamine with a sedative drug. The primary aim of our study was to examine the combined ketamine-midazolam action on cerebral activity; secondly, we planned to look at these interactions topographically at different points of the cortex to evaluate topographical differences in the combination's action; thirdly, the cerebral and haemodynamic reactions to anaesthesiological stimuli (intubation, gastric tube) were evaluated and compared. METHODS. Sixteen patients scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were examined. Topographical electroencephalometric data were obtained by processed EEG with a CATEEM system at 17 recording points over the cortex and compared with heart rate and arterial blood pressure during the induction period. After documentation of the baseline data ketamine (3 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) were applied within 10 min by means of an automatic device. At the end of the infusion period patients were intubated, and after a further 10 min a gastric tube was placed. RESULTS. Induction resulted in increases in delta and beta 2 output (P < 0.05) in the early induction period and in significant decreases (P < 0.05) in alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 1 activity. No significant change in theta activity was observed throughout the observation period. Intubation led to significant increases of power particularly in the temporal and parietal leads of all frequency bands, but not in the frontal area. Insertion of the gastric tube did not alter cerebral function. CONCLUSION. The interaction of ketamine and midazolam leads to increases in beta 2 and delta power and to significant decreases in the alpha bands and beta 1. Increases of theta activity, a typical effect of single-agent anaesthesia with ketamine, were not observed. Thus, the action of combined ketamine and midazolam on cerebral function is not an additive, but an interactive process. Despite a relatively high induction dosage, haemodynamic changes during intubation occurred and were accompanied by changes in cerebral activity. This can be regarded as incomplete cerebral suppression even by these induction dosages.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Anaesthesist"}

OBJECTIVE: To systematically review and meta-analyze data about clinical efficacy and safety for ketamine and ECT in patients with major depressive episode. DATA SOURCES: PubMed, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, and Embase were systematically searched using Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms and text keywords from database inception through April 19, 2022, with no language limits. Two authors also manually and independently searched all relevant studies in US and European clinical trial registries and Google Scholar. STUDY SELECTION: Included were studies that involved (1) a diagnosis of depression using standardized diagnostic criteria, (2) intervention/comparator groups consisting of ECT and ketamine, and (3) depressive symptoms as an efficacy outcome using standardized measures. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Data extraction was completed independently by 2 extractors and cross-checked for errors. Hedges g standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used for improvement in depressive symptoms. SMDs with corresponding 95% CIs were estimated using fixed- or random-effects models. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) reporting guideline was followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy outcomes included depression severity, cognition, and memory performance. Safety outcomes included serious adverse events (eg, suicide attempts and deaths) and other adverse events. RESULTS: Six clinical trials comprising 340 patients (n\u2009=\u2009162 for ECT and n\u2009=\u2009178 for ketamine) were included in the review. Six of 6 studies enrolled patients who were eligible to receive ECT, 6 studies were conducted in inpatient settings, and 5 studies were randomized clinical trials. The overall pooled SMD for depression symptoms for ECT when compared with ketamine was -0.69 (95% CI, -0.89 to -0.48; Cochran Q, P\u2009=\u2009.15; I2\u2009=\u200939%), suggesting an efficacy advantage for ECT compared with ketamine for depression severity. Significant differences were not observed between groups for studies that assessed cognition/memory or serious adverse events.

In the left BA10 and left amygdala, these relationships were driven primarily by the ketamine group (group\u2009*\u2009DTI-MD interaction effects: p\u2009=\u20090.016-0.082). In the right BA10, these associations generalized to both infusion arms (p\u2009=\u20090.007). In the left and right hippocampus, on the MADRS only, interaction effects were observed in the opposite direction, such that DTI-MD change was inversely associated with depression change in the ketamine arm specifically (group\u2009*\u2009DTI-MD interaction effects: p\u2009=\u20090.032-0.06). The acute effects of ketamine on depression may be mediated, in part, by acute changes in neuroplasticity quantifiable with DTI.", "doi": "10.1038/s41398-023-02451-0", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37160885/", "secondary_title": "Transl Psychiatry"}

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to investigate whether co-administration of alcohol or THC with MDMA differentially affects ongoing electroencephalogram (EEG) oscillations compared to the administration of each drug alone. METHODS: In two separate experiments, 16 volunteers received four different drug conditions: (1) MDMA (100 mg); (2) alcohol clamp (blood alcohol concentration\u2009=\u20090.6\u2030) or THC (inhalation of 4, 6 and 6 mg, interval of 1.5 h); (3) MDMA in combination with alcohol or THC; and (4) placebo.

RESULTS: Theta and alpha power increased after alcohol intake compared to placebo and reduced after MDMA intake. No interaction between alcohol and MDMA was found. Significant MDMA x THC effects for theta and lower-1-alpha power indicated that the power attenuation after the combined intake of MDMA and THC was less than the sum of each drug alone. For the lower-2-alpha band, the intake of MDMA or THC alone did not significantly affect power, but the intake of combined MDMA and THC significantly decreased lower-2-alpha power.

Methods: MDMA users and controls who abstained from ecstasy and other substances for at least 2 weeks were tested with a computerized cognitive test battery to assess their abilities on tasks that measure the three submodalities of executive function, and their combined contribution on two more complex executive tasks.

Our second aim was to explore the relationship between specific cognitive functions and P300 (P3) event-related potentials (ERPs) in ecstasy users.

Results: We found significant differences between ecstasy users and controls on cognitive measures of word fluency, processing speed, and memory recognition after 1-year follow-up. We found no significant differences between ecstasy and cannabis users or cannabis users and controls on cognitive tests. Lifetime ecstasy use was associated with poorer memory recognition. No group differences were shown on P3 latency or amplitude. Significant correlations emerged between P3 latency and cannabis lifetime use (higher cannabis use was related to faster latency, showing a paradoxical effect) but not with ecstasy exposure. Conclusions: Our findings provide evidence of mild long-term cognitive deficits among ecstasy polydrug users.

Responders (n = 10) had a larger reduction in MADRS scores (62%) compared to nonresponders (n = 9; 17%) (p<0.001). Both groups had significant reductions in MADRS\u2010SI scores (responders \u20101.9, p<0.001; nonresponders \u20101.6, p<0.001) and the difference in the magnitude of change in MADRS\u2010SI scores between groups was not statistically significant (p=0.44).

Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (\"ecstasy\") is known to cause lasting changes to the serotonin system in animals, and convergent evidence suggests that similar changes occur in human ecstasy users. Other research suggests that serotonin may be involved in lateral inhibition between orientation sensitive neurons in the occipital lobe, and that disruption to the serotonin system causes an increase in the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect illusion that is known depend on those neurons. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the present study was to determine if ecstasy users have detectable changes in occipital lobe behavioural functioning, as revealed by the tilt aftereffect illusion. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty ecstasy users and 34 non-drug using controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect illusion following adaptation to stimuli oriented at 15 and 40 degrees from vertical. RESULTS: Ecstasy users who had not used amphetamines for 115 days or more had a larger average tilt aftereffect than non-drug using controls after adaptation to 40 degrees stimuli but not after adaptation to 15 degrees stimuli. Additionally, there was no difference between non-drug using controls and ecstasy users who had used amphetamines within the last 61 days at either adaptation angle. CONCLUSIONS: The results were consistent with the proposal that ecstasy-related damage to the serotonin system causes behavioural changes on tests of visual perception processes that are thought to reflect serotonergic functions in the occipital lobe.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-007-0785-0", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/17457578/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

A recently hypothesized antidepressant mechanism of action of ketamine is the inhibition of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor-dependent bursting activity of the habenula (Hb), a small brain structure that modulates reward and affective states. METHODS: Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was conducted in 35 patients with MDD at baseline and 24 hours following treatment with i.v. ketamine. A seed-to-voxel functional connectivity (FC) analysis was performed with the Hb as a seed-of-interest. Pre-post changes in FC and the associations between changes in FC of the Hb and depressive symptom severity were examined. RESULTS: A reduction in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale scores from baseline to 24 hours after ketamine infusion was associated with increased FC between the right Hb and a cluster in the right frontal pole (t\u2009=\u20094.65, P\u2009=\u2009.03, false discovery rate [FDR]-corrected).

The recreational use of ecstasy has been associated with potentially severe toxicity. Interindividual differences in the clinical toxicity of MDMA may result from alterations in drugmetabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). The role of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 involved in the metabolism of MDMA is unclear. Therefore, effects of several CYP2D6 genetic variants, that are important for its activity, were characterized in healthy human subjects and examined for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of MDMA. Methods: This was a prospectively designed pooled analysis of eight double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, crossover studies in 142 Caucasian subjects. We included 71 male and 71 female aged between 18 \u2010 45 years. The drug was administered orally in a single dose with a dose range of 0.8\u20102.7 mg/kg (mean = 1.7 mg/kg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics measures were assessed repeatedly during the sessions. Subjective effects were assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) including: \u201cany drug effect\u201d and \u201cdrug liking\u201d. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyping was performed using commercial TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Group differences were analyzed using one\u2010way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with genotype, enzyme activity score, CYP2D6 phenotype, and sex as between\u2010subjects group factors, followed by Tukey post hoc tests. To account for differences in body weight and dosing, plasma levels were dose\u2010normalized to the mean dose. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Key results: In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), the maximum concentrations (Cmax) of MDMA and its active metabolite 3,4\u2010methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) were +15% (P<0.05) and +50% (P<0.001) higher, respectively, compared with extensive metabolizers (EMs). The area under the concentration\u2010time curve (AUC) from 0 to 6 h after dosing (AUC6) of the inactive metabolite 4\u2010hydroxy\u20103\u2010methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) was 50% lower in intermediate metabolizers (IMs) compared with EMs (P<0.05). Blood pressure and subjective drug effects like \u201cdrug liking\u201d increased more rapidly after MDMA administration in PMs than in EMs. The MDMA/HMMA AUC6 ratio, which inversely reflects CYP2D6 activity, correlated with the AUC values for any drug effect (P<0.001) and drug liking (P<0.001), indicating greater overall psychotropic effects in subjects with lower CYP2D6 function. Conclusions and Implications: The present study shows that the disposition of MDMA and its pharmacodynamics effects in humans are altered by polymorphic CYP2D6 activity. We found an increase in MDMA exposure and more rapid increases in the cardiostimulant and psychotropic effects of MDMA in subjects with poor CYP2D6 function. Although CYP2D6 PMs may be at increased risk for MDMA toxicity, the autoinhibition of CYP2D6 reduces the impact of the CYP2D6 genotype on MDMA PK. In fact, because CYP2D6 is inhibited by MDMA itself in all subjects, polymorphisms in other CYPs (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) and the pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A4 may actually become more clinically relevant than CYP2D6 genetics.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology"}

Functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography provide complementary spatiotemporal information and simultaneous recording of these two modalities can remove inter-session drug response and environment variability. We sought to assess the effects of ketamine and midazolam on simultaneous electrophysiological and hemodynamic recordings during working memory (WM) processes. Thirty participants were included in a placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design with ketamine and midazolam. Compared to placebo, ketamine administration attenuated theta power increases and alpha power decreases and midazolam attenuated low beta band decreases to increasing WM load. Additionally, ketamine caused larger blood-oxygen-dependent (BOLD) signal increases in the supplementary motor area and angular gyrus, and weaker deactivations of the default mode network (DMN), whereas no difference was found between midazolam and placebo. Ketamine administration caused positive temporal correlations between frontal-midline theta (fm-theta) power and the BOLD signal to disappear and attenuated negative correlations. However, the relationship between fm-theta and the BOLD signal from DMN areas was maintained in some participants during ketamine administration, as increasing theta strength was associated with stronger BOLD signal reductions in these areas. The presence of, and ability to manipulate, both positive and negative associations between the BOLD signal and fm-theta suggest the presence of multiple fm-theta components involved in WM processes, with ketamine administration disrupting one or more of these theta-linked WM strategies.

Within the next few years MDMA-assisted therapy is projected for approval by regulatory authorities. MDMA's primary mechanism of action includes modulation of monoamine signaling by increasing release and inhibiting reuptake of serotonin, norepinephrine, and, to a lesser extent, dopamine. This pharmacology affects sympathomimetic physiology. In controlled trials, special attention has been given to cardiovascular adverse events (AEs), because transient increases in heart rate and blood pressure have been observed during the MDMA-assisted therapy sessions. Finding and quantifying the potential drivers of cardiac AEs in clinical trials is difficult since only a relatively small number of participants have been included in these studies, and a limited set of allowed concomitant drugs has been studied. In this study a more diverse set of reports from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System was surveyed. We found 17 cases of cardiovascular AEs, in which the individuals had taken one or more substances in addition to MDMA. Interestingly, all of those concomitant medications and illicit substances, including opioids, stimulants, anticholinergics, and amphetamines, had been previously associated with cardiovascular AEs.

Bobo (Journal of Affective Disorders, 2016[Dec], Vol 206, 300-304). In the original article, there was an error in the classification of one study subject's positive treatment response status at the end of the postcontinuation phase of this study. We originally reported that all 5 subjects who achieved depressive symptom remission during the acute phase of the study (and thus received 4 weekly continuation phase ketamine infusions) were classified as responders at the end of the postcontinuation phase. However, one of these 5 subjects was misclassified as a positive treatment responder at the end of the post-continuation phase. Therefore, only 4 of these 5 patients were positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Although our main conclusions are not changed, we believe that it is our responsibility to report the error and updated results. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-53187-042[/rid]). Background: Little is known about the antidepressive effects of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions beyond the acute phase of treatment in patients with refractory depression. Methods: Twelve subjects with treatment-resistant non-psychotic unipolar or bipolar major depression and suicidal ideation were given repeated (up to 6) thrice-weekly acute-phase intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5mg/kg, administered over 100min). Those who remitted during acute-phase treatment received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of 4 weekly ketamine infusions, followed by 4 weeks of post-continuation phase follow-up (during which no further ketamine infusions were administered). Clinical measures were assessed at baseline, at 24h following each infusion, at the last acute-phase observation, and during continuation and post-continuation follow-up (acute phase remitters only). Results: Of the 12 enrollees, 5 (41.7%) remitted and 7 (58.3%) responded to ketamine treatment during the acute-phase. All five subjects who remitted during the acute-phase experienced further depressive symptom improvement during continuation-phase treatment. Four subjects lost remission status during the post-continuation phase, but all were still classified as positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Adverse effects were generally mild and transient during acute- and continuation-phase treatment; however, one subject developed behavioral outbursts and suicide threats during follow-up while hospitalized, and one subject died by suicide several weeks after the end of follow-up. Limitations: This was an uncontrolled feasibility study with a small sample size. Conclusions: The continuation-phase administration of ketamine at weekly intervals to patients with treatment-resistant depression who remitted during acute-phase ketamine treatment can extend the duration of depressive symptom remission. The antidepressive effect of ketamine persisted for several weeks after the end of continuation-phase treatment. Our results highlight the need for close monitoring of subjects who are at high baseline risk for suicide but do not respond clinically to ketamine.

Demographics, adverse events, and patient-reported dissociation were also analyzed. Symptom trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modeling, along with outcome predictors. RESULTS: A sample of 1247 completed treatment with sufficient data, 62.8\u00a0% reported a 50\u00a0% or greater improvement on the PHQ-9, d\u00a0=\u00a01.61, and 62.9\u00a0% on the GAD-7, d\u00a0=\u00a01.56.
