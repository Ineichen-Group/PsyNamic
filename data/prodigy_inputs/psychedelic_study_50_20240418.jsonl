Here, we used a machine learning algorithm applied to natural speech to ask whether language properties measured before psilocybin for treatment-resistant can predict for which patients it will be effective and for which it will not. METHODS: A baseline autobiographical memory interview was conducted and transcribed. Patients with treatment-resistant depression received 2 doses of psilocybin, 10\u202fmg and 25\u202fmg, 7 days apart. Psychological support was provided before, during and after all dosing sessions. Quantitative speech measures were applied to the interview data from 17 patients and 18 untreated age-matched healthy control subjects. A machine learning algorithm was used to classify between controls and patients and predict treatment response. RESULTS: Speech analytics and machine learning successfully differentiated depressed patients from healthy controls and identified treatment responders from non-responders with a significant level of 85% of accuracy (75% precision). CONCLUSIONS: Automatic natural language analysis was used to predict effective response to treatment with psilocybin, suggesting that these tools offer a highly cost-effective facility for screening individuals for treatment suitability and sensitivity.

Furthermore, the benefits of mindfulness are well documented. However, no systematic reviews have examined linkage of mindfulness and psychedelics use. The aim of this systematic review is to explore the link between psychedelics and characteristics of mindfulness. Methods: We conducted a systematic search across multiple databases, inclusive of grey literature and backwards/forward-citation tracking, on the 18 January 2021. The search strategy included terms relating to mindfulness and psychedelics, with no restriction on clinical or non-clinical conditions. Study quality was assessed. An exploratory random-effects meta-analysis was conducted on pre-post mindfulness data relative to psychedelic ingestion. Results: Of 1805 studies screened, 13 were included in the systematic review. There was substantial variability in participant characteristics, psychedelic administration method and measurement of mindfulness. The ingestion of psychedelics is associated with an increase in mindfulness, specifically relating to domains of acceptance, which encompasses non-judgement of inner experience and non-reactivity. The meta-analysis of a subset of studies (N = 6) showed small effects overall relative to ayahuasca ingestion, increasing mindfulness facets of non-judgement of inner experience and non-reactivity, as well as acting with awareness. Conclusions: Further methodologically robust research is needed to elucidate the relationship between psychedelics and mindfulness. However, mindfulness and specific facets relating to acceptance have been shown to increase following ingestion of psychedelics in a number of studies.

Unfortunately, the results from human research investigating its psychological effects have been inconsistent. OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure.

Participants were 2143 young adults, followed up from pre-birth to young adulthood. Measurements: Ecstasy use disorders were assessed with the composite international diagnostic interview (CIDI-Auto). Maternal socio-economic position and mental health status were assessed at baseline (antenatal visit); maternal substance use was measured at the 5-year follow-up, adolescents' behaviour at the 5- and 14-year follow-up and tobacco and alcohol use were assessed at the 14-year follow-up. Findings: Eight syndrome scales of childhood behaviour were examined. After adjustment for important confounders, delinquent and aggressive behaviour in early adolescence remained significantly associated with ecstasy use disorders in early adulthood. The associations became statistically non-significant when adolescent tobacco and alcohol use were included in the model [OR = 1.50 (95%CI = 0.75, 3.01) for delinquency and OR = 1.69 (95%CI = 0.92, 3.12) for aggression].

The effects of treatment refractoriness, the duration of the current depressive episode, and the number of prior antidepressant failures on ketamine efficacy also require clarification. METHODS: We recruited 84 outpatients with TRD and prominent suicidal ideation-defined as a score \u22654 on item 10 of the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS)-and randomized them into 2 groups to receive 0.5 mg/kg ketamine or 0.045 mg/kg midazolam.

RESULTS: According to the MADRS scores, the antidepressant effect (P\u2009=\u2009.035) was significantly noted in the ketamine group up to 14 days than in the midazolam group.

ECT is an effective treatment of TRD but cognitive side effects limit its use. Ketamine elicits a rapid antidepressant response in sub-anesthetic repeated doses. ECT and ketamine may be modulating the glutamate system, therefore when administered in an interleaved fashion, they could have a synergistic effect. METHODS: 15 TRD patients were recruited and 12 were included in the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to an ECT + iv. ketamine or ECT + iv. placebo (midazolam). At baseline and before each infusion, depression severity scales were administered. At baseline, halfway through and at the end of the study, cognitive tests were administered. RESULTS: There was no difference between the ketamine and placebo arms, per change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scores (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scores or cognitive tests. Per HAMD scores, 3 ECT +ketamine subjects (42%) showed early remission (HAMD < 8) and maintained euthymia for 3 additional visits. None of the ECT +midazolam subjects (0%) achieved early remission. This difference showed a trend level significance (Chi square P-Value = 0.0910). CONCLUSION: The results of the study were limited due to the small sample size.

In connection to local drug driving legislation, effective roadside detection of ketamine in suspected drug-impaired drivers has to be established. According to the drug evaluation and classification program (DEC), ketamine is classified in the phencyclidine (PCP) category. However, no study has been performed regarding the signs and symptoms exhibited by users under the influence of ketamine. In a study to develop a protocol for effective roadside detection of drug-impaired drivers, 62 volunteers exiting from discos were assessed using field impairment tests (FIT) that included measurements of three vital signs (i.e. body temperature, pulse rate and blood pressure), three eye examinations [pupil size, lack of convergence (LOC) and horizontal gaze nystamus (HGN)] and four divided attention tests (Romberg, one-leg stand, finger-to-nose and walk-and-turn tests).

It was found that when salivary ketamine concentrations were greater than 300 ng/mL, signs of impairment became evident, with over 90% detection rate using the FIT. By comparing the FIT observations on the 21 ketamine-only users with the drug-free subjects, the typical signs and symptoms observable for subjects under the influence of ketamine included LOC, HGN, elevated pulse rate and in general, failing the divided attention tests, especially the walk-and-turn and one-leg stand. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315\u2009\u03bcg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n\u2009=\u200939) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes.

We conducted a single-group proof-of-concept study to quantify acute effects of psilocybin in alcohol-dependent participants and to provide preliminary outcome and safety data. Ten volunteers with DSM-IV alcohol dependence received orally administered psilocybin in one or two supervised sessions in addition to Motivational Enhancement Therapy and therapy sessions devoted to preparation for and debriefing from the psilocybin sessions. Participants' responses to psilocybin were qualitatively similar to those described in other populations. Abstinence did not increase significantly in the first 4 weeks of treatment (when participants had not yet received psilocybin), but increased significantly following psilocybin administration (p < 0.05). Gains were largely maintained at follow-up to 36 weeks. The intensity of effects in the first psilocybin session (at week 4) strongly predicted change in drinking during weeks 5-8 (r = 0.76 to r = 0.89) and also predicted decreases in craving and increases in abstinence self-efficacy during week 5.

Despite a clear central role of the 5HT(2a) receptor in its mechanism of action, the contributions of additional receptors for which it shows affinity and agonist activity remain unclear. OBJECTIVES: We employed receptor-enriched analysis of functional connectivity by targets (REACT) to explore differences in functional connectivity (FC) associated with the distributions of the primary targets of LSD-the 5HT(1a), 5HT(1b), 5HT(2a), D1 and D2 receptors. METHODS: We performed secondary analyses of an openly available dataset (N\u2009=\u200915) to estimate the LSD-induced alterations in receptor-enriched FC maps associated with these systems. Principal component analysis (PCA) was employed as a dimension reduction strategy for subjective experiences associated with LSD captured by the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC) questionnaire. Correlations between these principal components as well as VAS ratings of subjective effects with receptor-enriched FC were explored. RESULTS: Compared to placebo, LSD produced differences in FC when the analysis was enriched with each of the primary serotonergic and dopaminergic receptors. Altered receptor-enriched FC showed relationships with the subjective effects of LSD on conscious experience, with serotonergic and dopaminergic systems being predominantly associated with perceptual effects and perceived selfhood as well as cognition respectively. These relationships were dissociable, with different receptors showing the same relationships within, but not between, the serotonergic and dopaminergic systems.

The questions covered the average amount taken per session, the longest duration of usage in the last 12-months, subjective effects while on-drug, and recovery effects in the days afterwards. Results: Mephedrone users reported a significantly longer maximum session of use than MDMA users. Mephedrone users also reported a significantly greater average amount used per session. The majority of on-drug subjective ratings did not differ between drugs, with similar increases in entactogenic effects. Although mephedrone users did report significantly more frequent issues with sleeping, anger and anxiety. In relation to recovery, mephedrone users reported more frequent craving, nasal irritation, paranoia, and relationship difficulties. Mephedrone users also rated general recovery effects as more severe over the seven-day period following use, taking more days to feel normal.

One of the rationales for its use was that it aids emotional insight by lowering psychological defences.

METHOD: Ten healthy participants received two functional magnetic resonance imaging scans (2 mg intravenous psilocybin v. intravenous saline), separated by approximately 7 days, during which they viewed two different sets of 15 positive autobiographical memory cues. Participants viewed each cue for 6 s and then closed their eyes for 16 s and imagined re-experiencing the event. Activations during this recollection period were compared with an equivalent period of eyes-closed rest. We split the recollection period into an early phase (first 8 s) and a late phase (last 8 s) for analysis. RESULTS: Robust activations to the memories were seen in limbic and striatal regions in the early phase and the medial prefrontal cortex in the late phase in both conditions (P<0.001, whole brain cluster correction), but there were additional visual and other sensory cortical activations in the late phase under psilocybin that were absent under placebo.

Still, there is some concern regarding its behavioral toxicity, and its dose-effect relationship is poorly understood. We previously explored the role of dose in the cognitive effects of MDMA in a systematic review of existing literature and found no evidence in animals that MDMA impairs memory at low doses (< 3 mg/kg) but mixed results at high doses (>= 3 mg/kg). Since this review comprised mostly of single-dose studies and an assortment of methodologies, an empirical dose-ranging study on this topic is warranted. Objectives The current study aims to evaluate the conclusion from our systematic review that 3 mg/kg may be the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia, and to further understand the dose-effect relationship of MDMA on behavioral assays of memory, addiction, and depression. Methods We systematically examined the effects of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg MDMA on Pavlovian fear conditioning; behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and conditioned responding; and the Porsolt forced swim test in mice. Results High doses of MDMA (>= 3 mg/kg) produced amnesia of fear conditioning memory, some evidence of an addictive potential, and antidepressant effects, while low doses of MDMA (<= 1 mg/kg) had no effect on these behaviors. Conclusions The present dose-ranging study provides further evidence that 3 mg/kg is the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia. These findings, in addition to our systematic review, demonstrate that careful selection of MDMA dose is critical. High doses (>= 3 mg/kg) should likely be avoided due to evidence that they can produce amnesia and addiction. Conversely, there is little evidence to suggest that low doses, which are usually administered in clinical studies (approximately 1-2 mg/kg), will lead to these same adverse effects. Ultra-low doses (< 1 mg/kg) are likely even safer and should be investigated for therapeutic effects in future studies.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-022-06086-9", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35179622/", "secondary_title": "PSYCHOPHARMACOLOGY"}

Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. \u00a92011 American Medical Association.

Subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) hyper-activity during rest has been consistently implicated in the pathophysiology of MDD, potentially driven in part by excessive hippocampal gluatmatergic efferents to sgACC. Reduction of sgACC activity has been associated with successful antidepressant treatment. This study aimed to examine whether task-based sgACC activity was higher in patients with MDD compared to controls and to determine whether this activity was altered by single-dose ketamine. In Study 1, patients with MDD (N = 28) and healthy controls (N = 20) completed task-based functional magnetic resonance imaging using an established incentive-processing task. In Study 2, a second cohort of patients with MDD (N = 14) completed the same scanning protocol at baseline and following a 40 min infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Task-based activation of sgACC was examined with a seed-driven analysis assessing group differences and changes from pre to post treatment. Patients with MDD showed higher sgACC activation to positive and negative monetary incentives compared to controls, associated with anhedonia and anxiety, respectively. In addition, patients with MDD had higher resting-state functional connectivity between hippocampus and sgACC, associated with sgACC hyper-activation to positive incentives, but not negative incentives. Finally, ketamine reduced sgACC hyper-activation to positive incentives, but not negative incentives. These findings suggest a neural mechanism by which ketamine exerts its antidepressant efficacy, via rapid blunting of aberrant sgACC hyper-reactivity to positive incentives.

Methods: In the Munich Assessment of Young Adults Study (MAYA) two samples of ecstasy users are investigated. Sample A is a sample of users drawn from an ongoing epidemiological longitudinal study of young adults in Munich. Sample B is an additional clinical sample. Both samples are characterized extensively and are neuropsychologically tested for attention, memory and executive functioning. A screening for harmful use is conducted with the German version of the WHO ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test). A Motivational Enhancement Intervention is applied when harmful use is detected. With a telephone interview the intervention's initial effect is assessed. Results: Initial results are based on a small sample. Use within the tested population is low to moderate. Still significant differences in attention, memory, and executive functioning could be detected with the current testing. Ecstasy users almost consistently showed the lowest cognitive functioning. The one difference is that ecstasy users were significantly faster in finger tapping and reaction. Note that the results are preliminary.

RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with 8-10 infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in depression; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453. CONCLUSION: In this naturalistic sample of patients with TRD in our clinical service, repeated ketamine infusions significantly decreased depression symptoms without impairing cognitive performance. The baseline cognition may positively predict antidepressant responses of repeated ketamine treatment.", "doi": "10.1186/s12888-022-03789-3", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35193541/", "secondary_title": "BMC Psychiatry"}

Psychedelics, known to affect perception and cognition, seem to change language, but a systematic, time-dependent exploration is lacking. Therefore, we aimed at mapping the psychedelic effects on language over the time course of the acute and sub-acute effects in an explorative manner. For this, 24 healthy volunteers (age [mean\u00b1SD, range]: 35\u00b111, 25-61 years; 33% women) received 50\u00a0\u03bcg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study.

The creative process consists of two modes: divergent thinking (DT) which consists of generating novel and original ideas, and convergent thinking (CT), the subsequent evaluation of generated ideas in regards to their usefulness [1]. Importantly, as well as being essential for everyday functioning, the (in)ability to \u201cthink outside of the box\u201d has been associated with disorders such as depression, with patients demonstrating rigid, inflexible thought patterns. Thus finding a way to enhance creativity is of broad interest. Since the mid\u201020th century, there has been a large number of anecdotal reports suggesting consumption of psychedelics enhances creativity [2]. However, no study has yet directly assessed the (sub)acute effect of a psychedelic on creative thinking in a controlled trial. Therefore, the aim of this double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled trial was to assess the acute and persisting effect of the classic psychedelic, psilocybin, on DT and CT. Methods: 60 healthy participants were allocated to a treatment condition (0.17 mg/kg psilocybin or placebo), and completed creative thinking tasks at two time points (120 minutes and 7 days post\u2010administration). The Alternate Uses Test (AUT) and the Picture Concept Task (PCT) were administered in accordance with previous studies [3,4]. As evidence suggests a distinction between deliberate (task\u2010based) creative cognition and spontaneous (insight) creative cognition [5], subjective feelings of spontaneous creative thinking were also assessed. Baseline change scores of the task outcome measures entered a mixed\u2010model ANOVA consisting of the between\u2010subject factor Treatment (psilocybin or placebo) and the within\u2010subject factor Time (acute and follow\u2010up) and Construct (dependent variables of the task). In case of a Treatment*Time*Construct interaction, independent samples t\u2010tests were conducted to assess group differences. Mann\u2010Whitney U tests assessed Treatment group differences in ratings of \u201cinsightfulness\u201d, and a spearman's correlation assessed the correlation between acute ratings of \u201cinsightfulness\u201d and long\u2010term changes in DT or CT. Results: Administration of psilocybin was associated with acute decreases in task\u2010based creative cognition, namely measures of CT (d=0.85) and DT on the PCT (Fluency, d=0.84; Originality, d= 0.65), and on one measure of DT on the AUT (Fluency, d=0.80). Conversely, psilocybin was associated with increased ratings of spontaneous creativity (d=1.78). Seven days after psilocybin administration, Novelty was found to be increased (d=0.52), whereas CT was still decreased (d=0.60), relative to placebo. Persisting changes in novelty were positively correlated with acute ratings of Insight (rs=0.30, p=0.03). Conclusion: Our data demonstrate that psilocybin induces a time\u2010 and construct\u2010related differentiation of effects on creative thinking, adding some support to the historical claims that psychedelics can facilitate aspects of the creative process, but emphasizes the distinction between spontaneous and deliberate creative cognition, as well as acute and persisting effects of the drug. Importantly, due to the subjective nature of quantifying creativity, and the sporadic occurrence of creative insights, our data suggest that the psilocybin can be used as a pharmacologically\u2010induced manipulation of creative thinking, to offer a way to systematically investigate underlying brain changes.", "doi": "10.1016/j.euroneuro.2021.01.043", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618649/", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology"}

Electroencephalographic (EEG)-derived measures have shown promise in predicting antidepressant response to a variety of treatments, and are sensitive to ketamine administration. This study examined their utility in characterizing changes in depressive symptoms following single and repeated ketamine infusions. METHODS: Recordings were obtained from patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (N\u00a0=\u00a024) enrolled in a multi-phase clinical ketamine trial. During the randomized, double-blind, crossover phase (Phase 1), patients received intravenous ketamine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) and midazolam (30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg), at least 1\u00a0week apart. For each medication, three resting, eyes-closed recordings were obtained per session (pre-infusion, immediately post-infusion, 2\u00a0h post-infusion), and changes in power (delta, theta1/2/total, alpha1/2/total, beta, gamma), alpha asymmetry, theta cordance, and theta source-localized anterior cingulate cortex activity were quantified. The relationships between ketamine-induced changes with early (Phase 1) and sustained (Phases 2,3: open-label repeated infusions) decreases in depressive symptoms (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Score, MADRS) and suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10) were examined. RESULTS: Both medications decreased alpha and theta immediately post-infusion, however, only midazolam increased delta (post-infusion), and only ketamine increased gamma (immediately post- and 2\u00a0h post-infusion). Regional- and frequency-specific ketamine-induced EEG changes were related to and predictive of decreases in depressive symptoms (theta, gamma) and suicidal ideation (alpha). Early and sustained treatment responders differed at baseline in surface-level and source-localized theta. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine exerts frequency-specific changes on EEG-derived measures, which are related to depressive symptom decreases in treatment-resistant MDD and provide information regarding early and sustained individual response to ketamine.

Recent evidence suggests that one or two administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in cancer and treatment\u2010resistant depression populations. Methods: This is a randomized waitlist control trial investigating the immediate and enduring antidepressant effects of two psilocybin administration sessions (20 and 30mg/70kg on sessions 1 and 2, respectively) with nondirective psychological support in patients diagnosed with MDD. Outcome measures include the GRID\u2010Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (GRID\u2010HAMD) scores at Baseline (>17 required for enrollment) and 1\u2010and 4\u2010weeks post psilocybin sessions. Results: Twenty\u2010one (of 24) participants have completed the intervention and the 1\u2010and 4\u2010week post psilocybin assessments (Mean age=40, SD=12; female=67%; Mean GRID\u2010HAMD=23, SD= 3.6; Mean Years w/Depression=21.5, SD=12.2). There were no differences in mean GRID\u2010HAMD scores between immediate treatment (IT) and delayed treatment (DT) conditions at baseline (MIT=22.9, SD=3.6; MDT=23.0, SD=5.6) but there were significant differences between conditions at 1\u2010wk (MIT=7.9, SD=7.2; MDT=23.8, SD=5.4; effect size: d=2.5) and 4\u2010wk (MIT=8.4, SD=5.7; MDT=23.9, SD=5.6; effect size: d=2.7).

Does Psilocybin Change Synaptic Vesicular Density in the Brains of Patients With Mild Cognitive Impairment?.^\nBackground: Amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI) is viewed as a precursor to AD, and is associated with synaptic loss, for which there are no effective treatments. There is renewed interest in using psychedelics, including psilocybin, to treat mental illness. Psilocybin appears to exert its psychedelic and clinical effects through 5HT2A serotonin receptor (5HT2A\u2010R) agonism. Promisingly, the results of preclinical animal studies suggests that psilocybin may promote synaptogenesis in brain regions responsible for learning and memory, possibly through 5HT2A\u2010R agonism. As such, psilocybin is worth exploring as a novel therapeutic for aMCI to counter neurogenerative disease progression. The proposed positron emission tomography (PET) study will determine whether psilocybin increases synaptic vesicular density (SVD), as measured by the radioligand [18F]SynVesT\u20101, and whether changes in SVD are associated with improvements in cognition. Methods: Thirty aMCI and 30 healthy control participants will be randomized under double\u2010blind conditions to either: 1) two psilocybin 25mg macrodoses, or 2) two placebo doses separated by 1 week. Supportive psychotherapy will be provided on the days of dose administration. PET scans will occur pre and one week post treatment. Neuropsychological assessments will occur pre and 1, 4, and 12 weeks post treatment. Results: It is expected that psilocybin treatment will be associated with increased SVD and improvements in cognition, in comparison with placebo.

Inpatients, aged 18\u201085, diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD, according to DSM\u2010IV), that have been offered and have accepted ECT, are eligible to participate. Patients must be proficient in spoken and written Swedish, and score \u2265 20 points on the Montgomery \u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Exclusion criteria are known allergy to the active substance; co\u2010morbid conditions that could interfere with the treatment (e.g. primary psychosis); habitual difficulties to speak, hear, remember or reason; on\u2010going or recent (6 months) drug abuse; treatment according to LPT (Lagen om psykiatrisk tv\u00e5ngsv\u00e5rd; Compulsory Psychiatric Care Act); and a number of cardiovascular conditions. Patients randomized to the experimental treatment receive intravenous infusions of racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg), delivered over a period of forty minutes thrice weekly (Monday, Wednesday, Friday). Patients in the control group receive ECT in line with standard procedures (including anesthesia, muscle relaxation and oxygenation) thrice weekly. ECT was chosen as the reference treatment as it is the most effective treatment for patients suffering from moderate to severe depression. Primary outcome is the proportion of patients in remission after 4 weeks of treatment in each arm. Remission is defined as a MADRS \u2264 10. The study uses a non\u2010inferiority design. Demonstrating superiority of ketamine was not an option based on the number of patients needed to gain sufficient power with such a design. Also, the investigators do not believe that ketamine treatment needs to be more effective, at least not in terms of the primary outcome. ECT is associated with side effects (in particular amnesia during the treatment period, but some patients also report persistent memory problems) and patients need to be anaesthetised under the supervision of a anaesthesiologist. The treatment is thus fairly demanding and expensive. A significant amount of patients are also unwilling to undergo ECT. Given non\u2010 inferiority of ketamine regarding the primary outcome, and given that it is associated with fewer side effects or shorter time to remission and does not involve the need for anaesthesia, in a risk\u2010benefit analysis the scale might be tipped in favour of ketamine, even if it is not superior per se. Secondary outcomes include proportion of patients in re mission and /or response and symptomatic relief at follow\u2010up time points (3, 6 and 12 months after treatment cessation). Also addressed is how the two treatments affect cognition. A computerized test battery, the Cambridge Automated Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) is administered prior to the first treatment, after two weeks, shortly after remission and at three additional time points (3, 6 and 12 months) after conclusion of the treatment. See figure for specification and description of cognitive tests. Blood samples are drawn before the first treatment and 2\u20103 months after finishing treatment. Apart from plasma and serum samples (which will be used for later analysis of potential biomarkers such as IL 6 and D\u2010serine), additional blood is collected for genomic DNA analysis. A total of 4 x 6 mL are taken at each occasion. Blood samples are stored at the regional biobank. Time to response will be analysed with parametric survival analysis (for changes in MADRS score) or with non\u2010parametric analysis of two\u2010way ordinal data with repeated measurements34 (for ordinal data). Cognitive data and biological samples will be analysed with t\u2010tests (paired or unpaired as appropriate) or with analysis of variance ANOVA. Study sample size was calculated based on actual or assumed remission rates, the primary outcome parameter of the study. A remission rate of 60% was set for the reference treatment (ECT). A non\u2010inferiority limit of 40% was set for the experimental intervention (ketamine). This is an arbitrary level, based on an ssumption of fewer and milder side effects, faster antidepressant effect and the fact that the patients do not need to be anaesthetized and given muscle relaxants. With the above limits, a power of 80% and a significance level of 5%, 97 patients are required in each arm, according to: n = (2 * 8,4 * p(1\u2010p) / difference2), where \"2\" and \"8,4\" are derived from significance and power levels, p are the (actual and assumed) levels for the proportion of patients reaching remission for ECT and ketamine (60% and 40% respectively). The size of the cohort is calculated to be sufficiently large to detect ECT\u2010associated cognitive side effects.", "doi": NaN, "pubmed_url": NaN, "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02659085"}

It has been utilized by indigenous peoples of Central and South America for centuries in a ceremonial setting to promote spiritual experiences. Indigenous societies have long employed psilocybin and other 5-HT 2A agonist classic psychedelics in their rites. They were a focus in psychiatry in the middle of the 20th century as both experimental medicines and tools for studying brain function. Due to the fact that traditional psychedelics were being used for purposes other than medical research and in connection with the burgeoning counterculture by the late 1960s and early 1970s, these scientific investigations fell out of favor. However, thanks to a number of encouraging studies that\u00a0validated the earlier research, interest in traditional psychedelics has surged among scientists in the 21st century. In this review, we examine therapeutic studies on psilocybin, the traditional psychedelic that has received the lion's share of recent attention. According to three controlled studies, psilocybin may reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety in the context of cancer-related psychological discomfort for at least six months after a single acute treatment for mood and anxiety disorders. Three months after two acute doses, individuals in a small, open-label study with treatment-resistant depression reported fewer depressive and anxiety symptoms. Small, open-label pilot studies on addiction have demonstrated encouraging success rates for alcohol and cigarette addiction.

A rapidly proliferating number of clinics offer KIT for depression and anxiety, using protocols without a strong evidence basis. Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017-03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies. RESULTS: Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d\u00a0=\u00a0-1.17 and d\u00a0=\u00a0-1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d\u00a0= -1.03 and d\u00a0=\u00a0-0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal. LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses, interpreting this dataset is limited by incomplete patient information and sample attrition.

This open-label study of the pharmacokinetics of psilocybin was performed to describe the pharmacokinetics and safety profile of psilocybin in sequential, escalating oral doses of 0.3, 0.45, and 0.6\u00a0mg/kg in 12\u00a0healthy adults. METHODS: Eligible healthy adults received 6-8\u00a0h of preparatory counseling in anticipation of the first dose of psilocybin. The escalating oral psilocybin doses were administered at approximately monthly intervals in a controlled setting and subjects were monitored for 24\u00a0h. Blood and urine samples were collected over 24\u00a0h and assayed by a validated liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) assay for psilocybin and psilocin, the active metabolite. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were determined using both compartmental (NONMEM) and noncompartmental (WinNonlin) methods. RESULTS: No psilocybin was found in plasma or urine, and renal clearance of intact psilocin accounted for less than 2% of the total clearance. The pharmacokinetics of psilocin were linear within the twofold range of doses, and the elimination half-life of psilocin was 3\u00a0h (standard deviation 1.1). An extended elimination phase in some subjects suggests hydrolysis of the psilocin glucuronide metabolite. Variation in psilocin clearance was not predicted by body weight, and no serious adverse events occurred in the subjects studied. CONCLUSIONS: The small amount of psilocin renally excreted suggests that no dose reduction is needed for subjects with mild-moderate renal impairment. Simulation of fixed doses using the pharmacokinetic parameters suggest that an oral dose of 25\u00a0mg should approximate the drug exposure of a 0.3\u00a0mg/kg oral dose of psilocybin. Although doses of 0.6\u00a0mg/kg are in excess of likely therapeutic doses, no serious physical or psychological events occurred during or within 30\u00a0days of any dose.

When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A.

When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyw016", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26874330/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

Methods: Using data from a randomized, double\u2010blind (DB), placebo\u2010controlled trial of esketamine (ESK) in patients with treatment\u2010resistant depression (TRD), we conducted exploratory analyses. To determine differences in the change in each depressive symptom on the MADRS subscale between placebo and antidepressant responses, a two\u2010way factorial analysis was conducted using the amount of change on Day 2 and 28 of treatment. In addition, exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were conducted on the MADRS subtotal variables on Day 2 and 28 of treatment to determine symptomatic improvement pattern between placebo response and antidepressant responses. Results: We found that as well as MADRS total score, each subscale of MADRS score did not significantly differ between esketamine and placebo at Day 2 and 28. On the other hand, factor analysis revealed that the factor structure of the response was different between esketamine and placebo at the 2nd day. There was no difference in the factor structure between esketamine and placebo in response on Day 28 of treatment. Conclusion: Factor analysis revealed different patterns of symptom improvement in the early phase of the intervention between esketamine and placebo. This finding suggests that a data driven approach may provide detailed efficacy information in clinical trials for antidepressants.
