6152,"Ketamine Versus Midazolam for Recurrence of Suicidality in Adolescents.^
Youth patients (ages 12‐18) who have recent suicidality (defined as suicidal ideation or behavior), and who are enrolled or expected to be enrolled in an intensive outpatient program (IOP) will be recruited for participation in the study. Upon informed consent/assent, baseline data will be collected regarding mood symptoms, suicidal ideation and behavior, associated comorbidities, and treatment history. Youth participants will be randomized to ketamine or midazolam, which will be provided twice weekly for two weeks. Participants will then have follow‐up assessments visits through week 12 to continue to monitor outcomes. Participants may be recruited directly from the IOP or from the ED or inpatient psychiatric unit, provided they have undergone evaluation and are confirmed to begin IOP treatment. The baseline visit and first infusion must be +/‐ 10 days of IOP enrollment. Enrollment of 264 subjects is expected to take place over a period of approximately 36 months. Enrolled participants will be involved in the study for approximately 14 weeks (screening plus 12 weeks of study follow‐up visits). Visits include a Screening Visit, a Baseline, 4 Study Intervention Visits, and 10 Follow‐Up Visits. Multiple streams of outcome measures will be utilized for this protocol, including self‐report measures, research assessor‐completed measures, clinic level measures, and behavioral measures. Aim 1. Evaluate reduction in frequency of suicidal events associated with two‐week twice‐weekly course of ketamine treatment versus midazolam. Aim 2. Evaluate reduction in implicit suicidal cognition with ketamine. Aim 3. Evaluate reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidality with ketamine."
8321,"Acute effects of MDMA and LSD co-administration in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^
There is renewed interest in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and practice. Although acute subjective effects of LSD are mostly positive, negative subjective effects, including anxiety, may occur. The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as ""candyflipping."" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) and LSD (100 µg) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD + MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (C(max) and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD + MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD + MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100 mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100 µg). The combined use of MDMA and LSD is unlikely to provide relevant benefits over LSD alone in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04516902."
1264,"Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties, but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking. METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of ≤5) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (±SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P = 0.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

7738,"Acute autonomic and psychotropic effects of LSD in healthy subjects in a placebo-controlled study.^
Objective: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypic hallucinogen and continues to be widely used recreationally. However, no modern studies on the acute effects of LSD are available. The aim of this study was to assess the autonomic, adverse, and subjective effects of a single representative dose of LSD in healthy subjects. Methods: After ethics approval, LSD (200 mg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects using a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled cross‐over design. Outcome measures included blood pressure, heart rate, core body temperature, pupil size, adverse effects and subjective drug effects assessed up to 24 hours. Results: LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature for up to 5 hours. Pupil size was increased for up to 11 hours. LSD produced adverse effects including dry mouth, lack of appetite, dizziness and headache, which completely subsided within 72 hours. There were pronounced alterations in waking consciousness including visual hallucinations, audio‐visual synesthesia and derealization and depersonalization phenomena that lasted 12 hours. Additionally, LSD enhanced subjective wellbeing, happiness, closeness to others and openness. Maximal plasma concentrations of LSD (mean ± SD: 4.5 ± 1.4 ng/mL) were reached 1.7 ± 1 hours after administration and declined to 0.6 ± 0.4 and 0.2 ± 0.2 ng/mL by 12 and 24 hours, respectively. A close relationship between the plasma concentrations of LSD and the autonomic or psychotropic response of LSD over time was observed. Conclusion: LSD produces marked hallucinogenic effects but also MDMA‐like empathogenic mood effects. LSD also produces significant sympathomimetic stimulation. The subjective and sympathomimetic response to LSD lasts up to 12 hours and is closely associated with the LSD concentrations in plasma."
3640,"Distinct acute effects of LSD, MDMA, and D-amphetamine in healthy subjects.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is an empathogen, and D-amphetamine is a classic stimulant. All three substances are used recreationally. LSD and MDMA are being investigated as medications to assist psychotherapy, and D-amphetamine is used for the treatment of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. All three substances induce distinct acute subjective effects. However, differences in acute responses to these prototypical psychoactive substances have not been characterized in a controlled study. We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, and endocrine effects of single doses of LSD (0.1 mg), MDMA (125 mg), D-amphetamine (40 mg), and placebo in a randomized, double-blind, cross-over study in 28 healthy subjects. All of the substances produced comparable increases in hemodynamic effects, body temperature, and pupil size, indicating equivalent autonomic responses at the doses used. LSD and MDMA increased heart rate more than D-amphetamine, and D-amphetamine increased blood pressure more than LSD and MDMA. LSD induced significantly higher ratings on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and Mystical Experience Questionnaire than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also produced greater subjective drug effects, ego dissolution, introversion, emotional excitation, anxiety, and inactivity than MDMA and D-amphetamine. LSD also induced greater impairments in subjective ratings of concentration, sense of time, and speed of thinking compared with MDMA and D-amphetamine. MDMA produced greater ratings of good drug effects, liking, high, and ego dissolution compared with D-amphetamine. D-Amphetamine increased ratings of activity and concentration compared with LSD. MDMA but not LSD or D-amphetamine increased plasma concentrations of oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma concentrations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor. These results indicate clearly distinct acute effects of LSD, MDMA, and D-amphetamine and may assist the dose-finding in substance-assisted psychotherapy research."
7739,"Acute Effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Subjects.^
BACKGROUND: After no research in humans for >40 years, there is renewed interest in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in clinical psychiatric research and practice. There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of LSD, and its endocrine effects are unknown. In animals, LSD disrupts prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and patients with schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI. However, no data are available on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men). Outcome measures included psychometric scales; investigator ratings; PPI of the acoustic startle response; and autonomic, endocrine, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena. Subjective well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by LSD. Compared with placebo, LSD decreased PPI. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine. Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided within 72 hours. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. CONCLUSIONS: In addition to marked hallucinogenic effects, LSD exerts methylenedioxymethamphetamine-like empathogenic mood effects that may be useful in psychotherapy. LSD altered sensorimotor gating in a human model of psychosis, supporting the use of LSD in translational psychiatric research. In a controlled clinical setting, LSD can be used safely, but it produces significant sympathomimetic stimulation."
3637,"Direct comparison of the acute effects of lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin in a double-blind placebo-controlled study in healthy subjects.^
Growing interest has been seen in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin in psychiatric research and therapy. However, no modern studies have evaluated differences in subjective and autonomic effects of LSD and psilocybin or their similarities and dose equivalence. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 28 healthy subjects (14 women, 14 men) who underwent five 25 h sessions and received placebo, LSD (100 and 200 µg), and psilocybin (15 and 30 mg). Test days were separated by at least 10 days. Outcome measures included self-rating scales for subjective effects, autonomic effects, adverse effects, effect durations, plasma levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), prolactin, cortisol, and oxytocin, and pharmacokinetics. The doses of 100 and 200 µg LSD and 30 mg psilocybin produced comparable subjective effects. The 15 mg psilocybin dose produced clearly weaker subjective effects compared with both doses of LSD and 30 mg psilocybin. The 200 µg dose of LSD induced higher ratings of ego-dissolution, impairments in control and cognition, and anxiety than the 100 µg dose. The 200 µg dose of LSD increased only ratings of ineffability significantly more than 30 mg psilocybin. LSD at both doses had clearly longer effect durations than psilocybin. Psilocybin increased blood pressure more than LSD, whereas LSD increased heart rate more than psilocybin. However, both LSD and psilocybin showed comparable cardiostimulant properties, assessed by the rate-pressure product. Both LSD and psilocybin had dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination. Both doses of LSD and the high dose of psilocybin produced qualitatively and quantitatively very similar subjective effects, indicating that alterations of mind that are induced by LSD and psilocybin do not differ beyond the effect duration. Any differences between LSD and psilocybin are dose-dependent rather than substance-dependent. However, LSD and psilocybin differentially increased heart rate and blood pressure. These results may assist with dose finding for future psychedelic research.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT03604744."
4967,"Autonomic, cardiovascular, and endocrine effects of LSD in healthy subjects.^
Introduction: LSD is used recreationally worldwide and there is renewed interest in using LSD in clinical psychiatric research and practice. However, there is limited data on the somatic and endocrine effects of LSD in humans. Method: LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over study. Cardiostimulant effects (blood pressure and heart rate), autonomic effects (body temperature and pupillary function), endocrine effects, and adverse effects were repeatedly assessed. Results: LSD induced positive mood, visual perceptual alterations, and audio‐visual synesthesia lasting for 12h. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD elevated the plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine but not norepinephrine. LSD impaired psychomotor performance (balance) and produced adverse side effects (difficulty concentrating, headache, exhaustion, dizziness) up to 24 h, which completely subsided within 72 h. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: The hallucinogen LSD produces significant sympathomimetic effects. The LSD‐induced increase in cortisol and prolactin is consistent with LSD's serotonergic properties. The cardiostimulant properties of LSD need to be considered in patients with hypertension or heart disease."
