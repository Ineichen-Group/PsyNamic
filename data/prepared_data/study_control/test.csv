"748","Assessing the risk-benefit profile of classical psychedelics: a clinical review of second-wave psychedelic research.^\nRATIONALE: A broad reassessment of the potential benefits of psychedelic drugs has led to the initiation of multiple major clinical trials in an effort to advance their status to become FDA-approved medications, as well as local legislative efforts to legalize or decriminalize their use. OBJECTIVES: To use recently published data to assess potential risks and benefits of psychedelic drugs as therapeutics, as well as to synthesize what is currently known in order to generate fruitful future research directions. METHODS: A review of studies conducted since 1991 identified 14 clinical trials of classical psychedelics, including 11 of psilocybin (N = 257 participants), 1 of lysergic acid diethylamide (N = 12 participants), and 2 of ayahuasca (N = 46 participants). Other published studies (e.g., of healthy volunteers, survey studies, case reports, neuroimaging) were also considered for review. RESULTS: Published studies since 1991 largely support the hypothesis that small numbers of treatments with psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can offer significant and sustained alleviation to symptoms of multiple psychiatric conditions. No serious adverse events attributed to psychedelic therapy have been reported. Existing studies have several limitations, including small sample sizes, inherent difficulty in blinding, relatively limited follow-up, and highly screened treatment populations. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial data have been gathered in the past 30 years suggesting that psychedelics are a potent treatment for a variety of common psychiatric conditions, though the ideal means of employing these substances to minimize adverse events and maximize therapeutic effects remains controversial. Unique factors related to study design are vital for clinical researchers in the field to address.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1631","Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2830","No difference in brain activation during cognitive performance between ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users and control subjects: A [H215O]-positron emission tomography study.^\nThe long-term use of the serotonin-releaser and uptake-inhibitor 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") has been associated with memory impairments and increased liability to depressive mood and anxiety attacks. It is unclear, however, whether these psychologic deviations are reflected in alterations of the underlying neurophysiologic substrate. The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-naïve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O]. Mood was assessed by means of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM-D) and the EWL Mood Rating Scale. Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention. However, significantly higher levels of depressiveness as determined by the HAM-D and EWL scales were found in Ecstasy-using subjects. These data indicate that, despite differences in mood, polytoxic Ecstasy users do not differ from Ecstasy-naïve controls in terms of local brain activity. Heightened depressiveness in the Ecstasy group was consistent with results from previous studies and could be related to serotonergic hypofunction resulting from repeated MDMA consumption. However, this study cannot exclude the possibility that the observed differences are preexisting rather than a result of Ecstasy use.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"3631","Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Psilocybin Administration in Healthy Participants.^\nPsilocybin is being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Only a few studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of psilocybin and have used body weight-adjusted dosing. Data on PKs and the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of fixed doses that are commonly used are unavailable. The present study characterized the PKs and PK-PD relationship of 15, 25, and 30 mg of orally administered psilocybin in 28, 23, and 28 healthy subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of unconjugated psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) and corresponding subjective effects were repeatedly assessed up to 24 hours. PK parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using PK-PD modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal psilocin concentrations were 11 ng/mL (10-13), 17 ng/mL (16-19), and 21 ng/mL (19-24) after the administration of 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after an average of 2 hours. Elimination half-lives were 1.8 hours (1.7-2.0), 1.4 hours (1.2-1.7), and 1.8 hours (1.6-1.9) for 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Mean (± SD) durations of subjective effects were 5.6 ± 2.2 hours, 5.5 ± 1.6 hours, and 6.4 ± 2.2 hours, and maximal effects (""any drug"" effects) were 58% ± 25%, 73% ± 27%, and 80% ± 18% after 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Psilocin exhibited dose-proportional PKs. The duration and intensity of subjective effects were dose-dependent. Body weight did not influence pharmacokinetics or the response to psilocybin. These data may serve as a reference for future clinical trials.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3719","Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^\nBACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5032","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

"5804","Greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine in males.^\nRATIONALE: Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6449","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6563","The relation between naturalistic use of psychedelics and perception of emotional stimuli: An event-related potential study comparing non-users and experienced users of classic psychedelics.^\nBackground: Previous research has suggested that controlled administration of psychedelic substances can modulate emotional reactivity, enhancing positive and diminishing negative emotions. However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300). Conclusions: The results suggest that naturalistic use of psychedelics may be linked to reduced reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli at the early and automatic processing stages. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the effects related to using psychedelics in naturalistic contexts.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6591","Ketamine and midazolam for invasive procedures in children with malignancy: a comparison of routes of intravenous, oral, and rectal administration.^\nWe investigated the efficacy of a combination of ketamine and midazolam, comparing intravenous, oral, and rectal administrations for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. Seventy-three children under 5 years of age, who were scheduled for invasive procedure, were assigned to one of three groups: IV group (n = 25), ketamine 1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg were given intravenously; PO group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given orally; and PR group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg given rectally. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for side-effects. Optimal sedation (drowsy and asleep) was provided in 78 per cent of all patients and no statistical difference was observed among the three groups. No severe complications were observed in all groups. Recovery time from sedation was significantly longer in the intravenous group (>120 min in two patients). Hallucination was noted in three (12 per cent) patients given intravenous medication, but not in those given oral or rectal medications. It is concluded that intravenous, oral, and rectal midazolam/ketamine are equally effective for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. The use of intravenous ketamine/midazolam may produce prolonged sedation and psychedelic effects in children. These adverse effects may alter the child's comfort and parental satisfaction.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"1791","Impulsivity, inhibition and negative priming in ecstasy users.^\nA modified Stroop color-word interference paradigm was used to investigate the effects of recreational ecstasy (MDMA) use on central executive inhibitory processes. Ecstasy users who also used cannabis were compared with non-users matched for cannabis consumption and with non-drug users on a Stroop task in which standard color-word interference trials were interspersed with trials in which the target color was the same as the distractor word on the immediately preceding trial. Ecstasy's effects on standard inhibition (conscious suppression of a prepotent response pattern-responsible for Stroop interference) could thus be contrasted with its effect on the short-term, unconscious, inhibitory process responsible for suppression of the preceding distractor word (negative priming). Neither drug group differed from the non-drug users in level of Stroop interference but ecstasy users showed reduced negative priming compared to the cannabis users and non-drug users. The loss of inhibition in the ecstasy users was not related to impulsivity assessed by two standard scales since these were similar in both drug-user groups and raised relative to the non-drug users. It is argued that previous failures to demonstrate loss of inhibition could be partly due to the fact that standard executive function tests, such as the Stroop, are unable to differentiate between sub-types of inhibition, only some of which may be affected by ecstasy use. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"4798","Ketamine as a novel treatment for major depressive disorder and bipolar depression: a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis.^\nOBJECTIVE: Given the significant disability, morbidity and mortality associated with depression, the promising recent trials of ketamine highlight a novel intervention. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of ketamine in comparison with placebo for the reduction of depressive symptoms in patients who meet criteria for a major depressive episode. METHOD: Two electronic databases were searched in September 2013 for English-language studies that were randomized placebo-controlled trials of ketamine treatment for patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression and utilized a standardized rating scale. Studies including participants receiving electroconvulsive therapy and adolescent/child participants were excluded. Five studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative meta-analysis showed that ketamine significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The overall effect size at day 1 was large and statistically significant with an overall standardized mean difference of 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.34) (P<.001), with the effects sustained at 7 days postinfusion. The heterogeneity of the studies was low and not statistically significant, and the funnel plot showed no publication bias.

"6295","Inpatient Buprenorphine Induction With Psilocybin for Opioid Use Disorder.^\nThe proposed study is a double‐blind, controlled investigation of the effect of 1 high‐dose psilocybin (30 mg) session compared to a very low dose session (1 mg) following standard‐of‐care buprenorphine induction on drug abstinence, quality of life, craving, tobacco use, and treatment retention in healthy participants with an active OUD diagnosis. Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions. At the end of the inpatient phase, participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase, during which participants will undergo visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events, clinical status, treatment adherence, and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine. All buprenorphine procedures will be open label and will follow standard‐of‐care practices. This trial utilizes a Bayesian sequential methodology, employing a maximum sample size of 90 participants and calculating Bayes factors (starting at 20 participants and assessed after each 10) to assess evidence for the null and experimental hypotheses, enabling potential early stopping for efficacy or futility based on predetermined thresholds (Bayes factor of 6 and 1/6).

"6909","Assessment of chronic exposure to MDMA in a group of consumers by segmental hair analysis.^\nThe suitability of segmental hair analysis of MDMA to monitor past chronic exposure to the drug was investigated in a follow-up study of ecstasy consumers. The purpose, among others, was to look for an objective biomarker of the history of drug consumption. Thirteen naturally colored hair samples were used to assess possible association between hair concentration of MDMA in 1-, 5-, and 9-cm segments and self-reported use in the last 1, 6, and 12 months. Agreement between the self-reported data given by the subjects on their ""ecstasy"" use in the previous month and MDMA hair concentration was good (r = 0.92) in all the examined subjects, with the exception of 2 individuals who declared a high consumption of the drug (12 tablets in the last month). When comparing the subjects' declaration of tablets consumed per month within the last 6 months, concordance with the hair MDMA values decreased and no correlation seemed to exist between the mean number of tablets consumed in the last 12 months and the concentration of MDMA in hair. However, when grouping subjects with a similar level of declared drug use (independently of whether in the previous month, last 6 months and last 12 months) and comparing the data with the mean MDMA concentrations found in the corresponding hair segments, an excellent level of agreement was found in groups of subjects consuming <5 tablets of MDMA per month (r = 0.93). Although the present findings were obtained from a small group of individuals and are intended as preliminary results, we can conclude that a cutoff of 0.5 ng MDMA per mg hair seems reasonable to assess drug consumption, unless the level of consumption was once per month in the last 12 months. Doubling the monthly consumption increases hair MDMA by around 1 ng/mg hair up to a level of 4 consumed tablets a month. It does not seem possible to draw definitive conclusions from higher concentrations in hair samples. Copyright © 2006 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7318","Chronic ketamine use increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.^\nRationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

"7750","The NMDA antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT agonist psilocybin produce dissociable effects on structural encoding of emotional face expressions.^\nRATIONALE: Both glutamate and serotonin (5-HT) play a key role in the pathophysiology of emotional biases. Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8031","Associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health.^\nBackground: In recent years, there has been significant research on the mental health effects of classic psychedelic use, but there is very little evidence on how classic psychedelics might influence physical health. Aims: The purpose of the present study was to investigate the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and markers of physical health. Methods: Using data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2018) with 171,766 (unweighted) adults aged 18 or above in the United States, the current study examined the associations between lifetime classic psychedelic use and three markers of physical health (self-reported overall health, body mass index, and heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months) while controlling for a range of covariates. Results: Respondents who reported having tried a classic psychedelic at least once in their lifetime had significantly higher odds of greater self-reported overall health and significantly lower odds of being overweight or obese versus having a normal weight. The association between lifetime classic psychedelic use and having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months approached conventional levels of significance, with lower odds of having a heart condition and/or cancer in the past 12 months for respondents who had tried a classic psychedelic at least once. Conclusion: The results of the present study suggest that classic psychedelics may be beneficial to physical health. Future research should investigate the causal effects of classic psychedelics on physical health and evaluate possible mechanisms.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8519","Glutamatergic deficit and schizophrenia-like negative symptoms: new evidence from ketamine-induced mismatch negativity alterations in healthy male humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Targeting the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is a major translational approach for treating negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Ketamine comprehensively produces schizophrenia-like symptoms, such as positive, cognitive and negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. The amplitude of the mismatch negativity (MMN) is known to be significantly reduced not only in patients with schizophrenia, but also in healthy controls receiving ketamine. Accordingly, it was the aim of the present study to investigate whether changes of MMN amplitudes during ketamine administration are associated with the emergence of schizophrenia-like negative symptoms in healthy volunteers. METHODS: We examined the impact of ketamine during an MMN paradigm with 64-channel electroencephalography (EEG) and assessed the psychopathological status using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in healthy male volunteers using a single-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for source localization. RESULTS: Twenty-four men were included in our analysis. Significant reductions of MMN amplitudes and an increase in all PANSS scores were identified under the ketamine condition. Smaller MMN amplitudes were specifically associated with more pronounced negative symptoms. Source analysis of MMN generators indicated a significantly reduced current source density (CSD) under the ketamine condition in the primary auditory cortex, the posterior cingulate and the middle frontal gyrus. LIMITATIONS: The sample included only men within a tight age range of 20-32 years. CONCLUSION: The MMN might represent a biomarker for negative symptoms in schizophrenia related to an insufficient NMDAR system and could be used to identify patients with schizophrenia with negative symptoms due to NMDAR dysfunction.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8836","Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"791","Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4038","Psychedelic medicines for end-of-life care: Pipeline clinical trial review 2022.^\nOBJECTIVES: People with terminal illnesses often experience psychological distress and associated disability. Recent clinical trial evidence has stimulated interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelics at end of life. Much uncertainty remains, however, mainly due to methodological difficulties that beset existing trials. We conducted a scoping review of pipeline clinical trials of psychedelic treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress at end of life. METHODS: Proposed, registered, and ongoing trials were identified from 2 electronic databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). Recent reviews and both commercial and non-profit organization websites were used to identify additional unregistered trials. RESULTS: In total, 25 studies were eligible, including 13 randomized controlled trials and 12 open-label trials. Three trials made attempts beyond randomization to assess expectancy and blinding effectiveness. Investigational drugs included ketamine (n = 11), psilocybin (n = 10), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (n = 2), and lysergic acid diethylamide (n = 2). Three trials involved microdosing, and fifteen trials incorporated psychotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: A variety of onging or upcoming clinical trials are expected to usefully extend evidence regarding psychedelic-assisted group therapy and microdosing in the end-of-life setting. Still needed are head-to-head comparisons of different psychedelics to identify those best suited to specific indications and clinical populations. More extensive and rigorous studies are also necessary to better control expectancy, confirm therapeutic findings and establish safety data to guide the clinical application of these novel therapies.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males. CONCLUSION: Differences in the drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations according to age and sex may be relevant for developing drug-prevention and education programs for some particular subgroups of the population based on the increased risk of adverse events in specific sex and/or age strata.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7419","The harmful health effects of recreational ecstasy: a systematic review of observational evidence.^\nOBJECTIVES: To investigate the harmful health effects of taking ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) for recreational purposes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched. Additional information on deaths was collected from the General Mortality Register (GMR) and the Special Mortality Register collated by the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD). REVIEW METHODS: Studies were categorised according to design, with systematic research syntheses (Level I evidence) the most valid and least open to bias. Where Level I evidence was not available, controlled observational studies (Level II evidence) were systematically reviewed. If neither Level I nor Level II evidence was available, uncontrolled case series and case reports (Level III evidence) were systematically surveyed. Data were extracted by one reviewer and a sample checked by a second. The heterogeneity of Level II evidence was addressed by undertaking stratified analyses for current and former ecstasy users and comparing them either with control groups using other illegal drugs but not ecstasy (polydrug controls) or with controls naïve to illegal drugs (drug-naïve controls). Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available. The largest, most consistent exposure effects were seen in meta-analyses of memory (especially verbal and working memory, with less marked effects seen in visual memory). Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

Methods: Our meta-analysis included previous studies that used ketamine in order to induce psychotic experiences in healthy participants and that recorded the MMN either by electroencephalography or magnetoencephalography. Results: The analysis revealed systematic MMN amplitude decreases and, with a lower effect size, latency increases after ketamine administration. However, the observed amplitude and latency effects did not vary between duration and frequency deviants. Conclusion: Across studies, there is no evidence that ketamine effects on the MMN are larger for duration than frequency deviants. Significance: Our findings tentatively suggest that, in addition to an NMDA receptor hypofunction, other factors might contribute to the sometimes observed pattern of impaired MMN responses to duration deviants, but unimpaired MMN responses to frequency deviants in schizophrenia.

"1385","A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

"2232","Baseline delta sleep ratio predicts acute ketamine mood response in major depressive disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power between 0.6 and 4Hz) has been proposed as a marker of central synaptic plasticity. Decreased generation of sleep slow waves--a core feature of sleep in depression--indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease. Various measures of SWA have previously been used to predict antidepressant treatment response. This study examined the relationship between baseline patterns of SWA in the first two NREM episodes and antidepressant response to an acute infusion of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Thirty patients (20M, 10F, 18-65) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) who had been drug-free for two weeks received a single open-label infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5mg/kg) over 40 min. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after ketamine infusion. Sleep recordings were obtained the night before the infusion and were visually scored. SWA was computed for individual artifact-free NREM sleep epochs, and averaged for each NREM episode. Delta sleep ratio (DSR) was calculated as SWA(NREM1)/SWA(NREM2). RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was observed between baseline DSR and reduced MADRS scores from baseline to Day 1 (r=.414, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small (N=30) and all subjects had treatment-resistant MDD, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend this observation to other patient groups.

"2483","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2783","MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.^\nSocial decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We administered 100 mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment × opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5968","Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder: a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^\nBackground: ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed, global, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine (ESK) nasal spray vs placebo (PBO) nasal spray, given in the context of comprehensive standard of care (SoC; ie, hospitalization, initiation, or optimization of antidepressant therapy), in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation with intent. These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

"6015","Interaction Between Duloxetine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy).^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine through an interaction with the corresponding presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter. 5‐HT transport inhibitors block MDMA‐induced 5‐HT release in vitro or in animals and also attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA in humans. NE transport inhibitors similarly prevent the MDMA‐induced release of NE in cell assays and attenuate behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. Effects of the NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the response to MDMA in humans are currently investigated. Here we suggest evaluating effects of pretreatment with the combined 5‐HT and NE transport blocker duloxetine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The study will use a randomized double‐blind cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Duloxetine (120 mg) or placebo will be administered 16 h and 4 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6044","Psilocybin-facilitated Smoking Cessation Treatment: a Pilot Study.^\nOne of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. We propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008). It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine‐dependent cigarette smokers, who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open‐label pilot‐study with no control condition. Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=40), or nicotine patch (n=40) treatment. Participants will receive a 13‐week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day‐long psilocybin session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10‐week course of nicotine patch treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, 50 of these participants (25 per treatment condition) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain‐based mechanisms associated with these treatments. Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin session after completing the 6‐month follow‐up meeting.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8606","Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8889","Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^\nN,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA.

"1237","A novel study design to evaluate the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.^\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an elevated rate of mortality, primarily due to suicide. The risk of suicide in those with MDD is about 20 times that of the general population, with approximately half of all suicides occurring in depressed individuals. While conventional antidepressants are often effective in treating depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI), their delayed onset of action significantly limits their utility in the treatment of patients with MDD who are at imminent risk of for suicide. Recently, several studies of ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated that these agents can improve symptoms of depression in individuals with MDD within hours of administration. Additionally, preliminary studies of ketamine suggest it may have a similarly rapid effect in significantly reducing SI in subjects with MDD. As such, Janssen R&D is developing intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The pursuit of this novel indication has required the development of an innovative study design that allows for the detection of rapid symptom change, and addresses the safety and ethical concerns of studying an acutely suicidal patient population. This poster will discuss the design and implementation of PeRSEVERe (ESKETINSUI2001), an ongoing proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: PeRSEVERe is an ongoing 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of intranasal esketamine in 70 adult subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Eligible subjects must have active suicidal ideation and intent, and be in need of psychiatric hospitalization. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 4 hours post‐dose on Day 1. Secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of single and repeated doses of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo on the clinician's assessment of suicide risk as measured by the Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool, and the subject's report of the severity in suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, through the end of the double‐blind treatment and follow‐up phases. Additionally, the study evaluates response rates (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score from baseline, with onset by Day 1 sustained through the end of the double‐blind treatment phase) across treatment groups. Safety objectives include the assessment of dissociative and psychosis‐like symptoms, sedation, nasal tolerability, vital signs and suicidal thinking and behavior. The study consists of a 24‐48 hour screening evaluation performed prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose, immediately followed by a 25‐day double blind treatment phase, and a 56‐day follow up phase. Given the vulnerability of the patient population, the study is being conducted in the context of standard clinical care, with all subjects receiving standard antidepressant medication and initial in‐patient hospitalization. Results: PeRSEVERe is the first large‐scale, prospective, placebo‐controlled trial of a rapidly acting antidepressant in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study is being conducted in the United States and is currently ongoing, with over 70% of subjects enrolled. Details and rationale for the study design, outcome measures, and key efficacy times points will be discussed. Additionally, key operational insights and challenges unique to the study of a rapidly acting antidepressant in a suicidal patient population will e highlighted. Conclusions: PeRSERVERe employs innovative clinical trial methodology in a Phase 2 study for a novel indication, in a vulnerable patient population‐i.e. the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Should this approach prove successful in Phase 2, similar methods will be considered in the design of subsequent pivotal trials of esketamine, and possibly other rapidly acting antidepressants. Results of PeRSERVERe are expected to be available in 2016.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1255","Double-blind comparison of the two hallucinogens psilocybin and dextromethorphan: similarities and differences in subjective experiences.^\nRATIONALE: Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) are hallucinogens, they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared. OBJECTIVE: This study compared subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Various subjective, behavioral, and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength, with similar times to maximal effect and time-course. Psilocybin produced orderly dose-related increases on most participant-rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens. DXM produced increases on most of these same measures. However, the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent, brighter, distinctive, and complex (including textured and kaleidoscopic) images and visions. Compared to DXM, psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical-type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music. In contrast, DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment, nausea/emesis, and light-headedness. Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance. CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences, with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual, mystical-type, insightful, and musical experiences, and DXM producing greater disembodiment.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1278","Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1293","Perceived adverse consequences associated with MDMA/Ecstasy use among young polydrug users in Ohio: Implications for intervention.^\nThe use of MDMA/Ecstasy has increased among young people in many industrialised nations around the world since the mid-1990s. Although there is a lack of scientific consensus concerning the long-term consequences of Ecstasy use, reducing potential morbidity and mortality is an important public health concern. This article describes how young people characterise perceived long-term consequences associated with Ecstasy using three data sources: (1) qualitative interviews with 29 participants; (2) pile sort results from 20 participants who classified 15 psychoactive substances on the basis of perceived similarities; and (3) quantitative data on subjective memory impairment from 402 participants in our natural history study. Contrary to expectations, Ecstasy was classified midway between drugs perceived to be the most and least risky. Risks associated with Ecstasy use included two popular myths implying forms of brain damage - ""draining spinal fluid"" and ""creating holes in brains"". Qualitative results also indicated that some young people are concerned about the potential affects of the drug on memory and as a cause of depression. About 20% (82) of the participants (n=402) ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that Ecstasy has impaired their memories. Concern about these adverse consequences may provide opportunities for reducing potential harm associated with Ecstasy use. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1345","Measuring acute effects of subanesthetic ketamine on cerebrovascular hemodynamics in humans using TD-fNIRS.^\nQuantifying neural activity in natural conditions (i.e. conditions comparable to the standard clinical patient experience) during the administration of psychedelics may further our scientific understanding of the effects and mechanisms of action. This data may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers enabling more personalized treatments and improved patient outcomes. In this single-blind, placebo-controlled study with a non-randomized design, we use time-domain functional near-infrared spectroscopy (TD-fNIRS) to measure acute brain dynamics after intramuscular subanesthetic ketamine (0.75 mg/kg) and placebo (saline) administration in healthy participants (n = 15, 8 females, 7 males, age 32.4 ± 7.5 years) in a clinical setting. We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology (e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity). Furthermore, ketamine led to a brain-wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region. Lastly, we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology. Overall, our study demonstrated the successful application of fNIRS neuroimaging to study the physiological effects of the psychoactive substance ketamine in humans, and can be regarded as an important step toward larger scale clinical fNIRS studies that can quantify the impact of psychedelics on the brain in standard clinical settings.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1455","Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nOBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

Recreational use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is widespread. The present study aimed to examine both the acute and residual effects of this drug on users' mood and cognitive function. Design and participants. A parallel group design was used to compare 12 participants who reported having taken MDMA with 12 participants who reported having consumed only alcohol, on the relevant night (day 1). These same participants were then re-assessed the following day (day 2) and again mid-week (day 5). Findings. Acute effects of MDMA broadly replicated previous findings. MDMA users rated elevated mood on day 1 but significantly low mood on day 5, at which point some participants scored within the range for clinical depression. In contrast, the alcohol group showed less pronounced changes, which followed a U-shaped curve over days with the lowest point being day 2. The MDMA group also showed significant impairments on an attentional/working memory task, compared with alcohol users. Conclusions. Weekend use of MDMA may lead to depressed mood mid-week. Possible mechanisms underlying the findings are discussed in terms of temporary depletion of serotonin, serotonergic neurotoxity and psychological aspects of mood change.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"1765","Nicotine fails to attenuate ketamine-induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms in humans: implications for schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, induces a range of symptoms resembling those seen in schizophrenia. Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2031","Evidence for chronically altered serotonin function in the cerebral cortex of female 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine polydrug users.^\nCONTEXT: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also popularly known as ""ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that produces loss of serotonin axons in animal models. Whether MDMA produces chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in humans remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MDMA use is associated with chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in the cerebral cortex of women as reflected by increased serotonin(2A) receptor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study comparing serotonin(2A) receptor levels in abstinent female MDMA polydrug users with those in women who did not use MDMA (within-group design assessing the association of lifetime MDMA use and serotonin(2A) receptors). Case participants were abstinent from MDMA use for at least 90 days as verified by analysis of hair samples. The serotonin(2A) receptor levels in the cerebral cortex were determined using serotonin(2A)-specific positron emission tomography with radioligand fluorine 18-labeled setoperone as the tracer. SETTING: Academic medical center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 female MDMA users and 10 women who did not use MDMA (controls). The main exclusion criteria were nondrug-related DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders and general medical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical serotonin(2A) receptor nondisplaceable binding potential (serotonin(2A)BP(ND)). RESULTS: MDMA users had increased serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in occipital-parietal (19.7%), temporal (20.5%), occipitotemporal-parietal (18.3%), frontal (16.6%), and frontoparietal (18.5%) regions (corrected P < .05). Lifetime MDMA use was positively associated with serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in frontoparietal (β = 0.665; P = .007), occipitotemporal (β = 0.798; P = .002), frontolimbic (β = 0.634; P = .02), and frontal (β = 0.691; P = .008) regions. In contrast, there were no regions in which MDMA use was inversely associated with receptor levels. There were no statistically significant effects of the duration of MDMA abstinence on serotonin(2A)BP(ND). CONCLUSIONS: The recreational use of MDMA is associated with long-lasting increases in serotonin(2A) receptor density. Serotonin(2A) receptor levels correlate positively with lifetime MDMA use and do not decrease with abstinence. These results suggest that MDMA use produces chronic serotonin neurotoxicity in humans. Given the broad role of serotonin in human brain function, the possibility for therapeutic MDMA use, and the widespread recreational popularity of this drug, these results have critical public health implications.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

OBJECTIVE: To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: Proof-of-concept, randomized, double-blind, crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control, midazolam, conducted at a single site (Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, New York). Forty-one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.045 mg/kg). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, the Clinical Global Impression-Severity and -Improvement scales, and adverse effect measures, including the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and the Young Mania Rating Scale. RESULTS: Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity, compared with midazolam, when assessed 24 hours after infusion (mean difference in Impact of Event Scale-Revised score, 12.7 [95% CI, 2.5-22.8]; P = .02). Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first-period analyses, and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24-hour depressive symptom severity. Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation. Ketamine was generally well tolerated without clinically significant persistent dissociative symptoms. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study provides the first evidence for rapid reduction in symptom severity following ketamine infusion in patients with chronic PTSD. If replicated, these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with this disabling condition.

"2957","Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

Here, we expand upon the previous report of primary outcomes from a phase 2 study of COMP360 in individuals with TRD-the largest randomised controlled clinical trial of psilocybin-to discuss findings of the exploratory efficacy endpoints. METHODS: In this phase 2, double-blind trial, 233 participants with TRD were randomised to receive a single dose of psilocybin 25 mg, 10 mg, or 1 mg (control), administered alongside psychological support from trained therapists. Efficacy measures assessed patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, positive and negative affect, functioning and associated disability, quality of life, and cognitive function. RESULTS: At Week 3, psilocybin 25 mg, compared with 1 mg, was associated with greater improvements from Baseline total scores in all measures. The 10 mg dose produced smaller effects across these measures. LIMITATIONS: Interpretation of this trial is limited by the absence of an active comparator and the possibility of functional unblinding in participants who received a low dose of psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: Three weeks after dosing, psilocybin 25 mg and, to a lesser degree, 10 mg improved measures of patient-reported depression severity, anxiety, affect, and functioning.

"3149","Adjunctive music improves the tolerability of intravenous ketamine for bipolar depression.^\nIntravenous ketamine is an effective treatment of bipolar depression. One of its most important side-effects is a transient altered state of consciousness commonly referred to as dissociation. These states can be anxiety-provoking, distressing and even treatment-limiting, warranting research into mitigation strategies. In this article, we present two cases that demonstrate the potential of adjunctive music to diminish the distress associated with ketamine-induced dissociation—though not necessarily its degree—in bipolar 1 disorder. Both patients suffering from severe depression underwent their first ketamine infusion without music and opted for music with subsequent infusions. They reported that music significantly improved the tolerance of their dissociative symptoms, thereby reducing distress and facilitating subsequent treatments. Both patients achieved remission from their highly treatment-resistant depressive episodes following six ketamine infusions. This is the first report of music’s benefits on ketamine for bipolar 1 depression, though there is precedence in the scientific literature on ‘psychedelics’ where the use of music in combination with medication-induced altered states has been studied. The principles regarding music selection that have resulted from this paradigm may be applicable to the use of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression. The optimal use of music with ketamine warrants further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"3909","The Impact of Psilocybin on Patients Experiencing Psychiatric Symptoms: A Systematic Review of Randomized Clinical Trials.^\nOBJECTIVE: This systematic review aims to evaluate the impact of psilocybin on patients experiencing psychiatric symptoms, with a focus on health-related quality of life (HRQoL) and safety. METHOD OF RESEARCH: Following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we searched the PubMed database and identified studies published from January 2011 to December 2021 pertaining to the impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms. Two authors independently conducted a focused analysis and reached a final consensus on five studies meeting the specific selection criteria. Study bias was addressed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. RESULTS: The impact of psilocybin on psychiatric symptoms was examined in five randomized controlled trials (RCTs). Four studies administered 1 to 2 doses of psilocybin, with doses ranging from 14mg/70kg to 30mg/70kg, and one study administered a fixed dose of 25mg to all participants. Administration of psilocybin resulted in significant and sustained reduction in symptoms of anxiety and depression, enhanced sense of wellbeing, life satisfaction, and positive mood immediately after psilocybin administration and up to six months after conclusion of treatment. All studies included some form of psychotherapy, and none reported serious adverse effects. CONCLUSION: RCTs show the efficacy of psilocybin in the treatment of anxiety and depression symptoms, as well as improvement in HRQoL, and no serious side effects. However, additional research is necessary to characterize predictors of treatment response, patient screening requirements, effectiveness in broader clinical populations, and guidelines for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

However, research on how psychedelics interact with other psychoactive substances remains scarce. Objectives: The current study aimed to explore the subjective effects of psychedelics when used alongside cannabis. Methods: Participants (n = 321) completed a set of online surveys at 2 time points: 7 days before, and 1 day after a planned experience with a serotonergic psychedelic. The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual ‘setting’ variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

"4634","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^\nObjective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. METHODS: In the present study, we aimed to block the MDMA-induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (metyrapone) together with a single dose of MDMA. Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo-controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and metyrapone (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pre-treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. RESULTS: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA-induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA-induced memory deficit from happening. CONCLUSION: We therefore conclude that MDMA-induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA-induced memory impairments.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"4640","Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

To further study this psychotomimetic property of ketamine, we administered 0.3 mg kg-1 of the drug to schizophrenic individuals during a [15O] water cerebral blood flow study. Regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was measured using H2(15)O and positron emission tomography (PET) before and after ketamine administration to identify regions of flow change, rCBF was increased in anterior cingulate cortex and was reduced in the hippocampus and primary visual cortex (lingual and fusiform gyri).

However, its individual-based methodology poses challenges for scaling and resource availability. The HOPE trial (A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer) is an Institutional Review Boards-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study examining psilocybin-assisted group therapy in cancer patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder (including major depressive disorder as well as adjustment disorder with depressed mood). We report here the safety and clinical outcome measures including six-months follow up data. METHODS: Outcome measures were collected at baseline, two-weeks and 26-weeks postintervention. The study involved three group preparatory sessions, one high-dose (25 mg) group psilocybin session, and three group integration sessions with cohorts of four participants over a three-week intervention. RESULTS: Twelve participants completed the trial. no serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin occurred. The primary clinical outcome measures of change in symptoms of depression on the clinician administered 17-item-HAM-D showed clinically substantial decrease in HAM-D scores from baseline to the two-week timepoint (21.5-10.09, P < 0.001) and the 26-week timepoint (21.5-14.83, P = 0.006). Six out of 12 participants met criteria for remission at two weeks, as defined by HAM-D < 7, three out 12 demonstrated a clinically significant change (4-6 points), and eight out of twelve demonstrated a clinically substantial change (7-12 points). CONCLUSION: This pilot study demonstrated the safety, feasibility, and possible efficacy of psilocybin-assisted group therapy for cancer patients dealing with depressive symptoms. Based on demonstrated efficacy and significant reductions in therapist time, future investigations with the group therapy model are warranted.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"4961","Acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients during LSD-assisted psychotherapy.^\nBackground: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is increasingly used in clinical research. The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects. Additionally, acute effects of LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales (VASs), the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). Results: In healthy subjects, LSD acutely and dose‐dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, trust and closeness to others on the VASs. On the 5D‐ASC, LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg. LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) had similar effects on the 5D‐ASC and induced similar mystical‐type experiences in the MEQ in healthy subjects and patients (alone and in group settings). Conclusions: LSD has acute empathogenic effects that may be beneficial in psychotherapy. Preliminary findings indicate that LSD produced largely comparable acute alterations in consciousness and mystical‐type experiences in healthy subjects in an experimental setting and in psychiatric patients in different treatment settings.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

This randomized controlled study included 654 Chinese women undergoing cesarean section. At 10 min after child birth, patients in the ketamine group were given 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, whereas patients in the control group received standard postpartum care. At the end of operation, all patients were armed with a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia device. The primary outcome was the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD), as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the secondary outcomes included the safety assessment and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of postoperative pain. The prevalence of postpartum blues and postpartum depression were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group. Logistic analysis showed that ketamine administration protected against postpartum depression, and PPD-associated risk factors included stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. In addition, the antidepressive effect of prophylactic ketamine was stronger in mothers with a history of moderate stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that ketamine functions as a prophylactic agent against PPD.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

Thirty-five patients completed the study, 18 received regular opioids plus ketamine, while 17 received regular opioids plus placebo. Using the Brief Pain Inventory, the % pain relief that the patients in the ketamine group attributed to their medication improved significantly from 50% immediately pre-infusion to 65% 24 h post-infusion and 69% 5 days post infusion. Over the same period, the pain relief achieved by the placebo group rose from 58% pre-infusion to 56% 24 h post infusion and then 50% relief 5 days later. This was statistically significant (P<0.05) using both the t-test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test. The ketamine group also showed a statistically significant difference 24 h post infusion of the effect of pain on their general activity (P=0.03) and on their enjoyment of life (P=0.004).

"5760","Self reported sleep quality and cognitive performance in ecstasy users.^\nObjectives: Research suggests that ecstasy users exhibit psychobiological changes relative to nonusers such as altered sleep patterns and cognitive deficits. In turn, it has been suggested that sleep quality may be a mediator of such cognitive deficits in ecstasy users. The present study sought to investigate this proposed relationship. Methods: Aspects of cognitive functioning in 104 ecstasy users and 103 nonusers obtained from our previous studies were reanalysed to explore the extent to which ecstasy-related group differences were attributable to differences in sleep quality. Cognitive function was assessed via the computation span test, consonant updating, paired associate learning, syllogistic reasoning and word fluency. Sleep quality was measured via the Epworth Sleepiness Scale (ESS), and the Karolinska Sleepiness Scale (KSS). Results: Ecstasy users performed worse than nonusers on all cognitive measures. While no differences were observed on the ESS, ecstasy users reported greater tiredness at the beginning of testing than nonusers. When the sleep variables were included as covariates, the effects of ecstasy on all cognitive measures remained significant. Conclusions: The results of the present study suggest little evidence for the mediating effects of sleep on cognitive function in ecstasy users.

"6084","Role of the Serotonin 5-HT2A Receptor in LSD-induced Altered States of Consciousness (LDR-Study).^\nSerotonin receptors, especially the 5HT2A receptor, are thought to be involved in the effects of various recreationally used psychedelic substances such as LSD. LSD potently stimulates the 5‐HT2A receptor but also 5‐HT2B/C, 5‐HT1 and dopaminergic receptors. LSD induces acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including visual perceptual alterations, audio‐visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization. LSD has therefore been used as experimental tool (""psychotomimetic"") in modern psychiatric research to study psychotic‐like states and model psychosis in healthy subjects [1‐5]. However, the dose‐effects of 5‐HT2A receptor stimulation by LSD has not yet been studied. Additionally, there is still very limited data to what extent the 5HT2A receptor contributes to LSD's effects and its role in the mediation of the full response to LSD at a high dose is unclear. A recent experimental human study showed the 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin fully blocked the subjective effects of a moderate dose of 100 µg of LSD [6]. But, whether the effects of a high 200 µg oral dose of LSD can be blocked by the selective pharmacological 5‐HT2A antagonist ketanserin remains to be tested to confirm the critical role of the 5‐HT2A receptor in more pronounced alterations of consciousness and perception. The present study therefore explores the role the 5‐HT2A receptor in LSD‐induced altered states of consciousness using escalating doses of LSD and the 5‐HT2A receptor blocker ketanserin administered before a high dose of LSD.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

"6121","A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

"6302","Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^\nSemantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia. In the current study, the N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness. Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated: (1) explicit versus implicit processing, that is, unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and (2) direct versus indirect processing, that is, word pairs that are closely (LION-TIGER) or distantly (LION-STRIPES) related. The immediate effects of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng/mL) were examined in a placebo-controlled double-blind repeated-measures group design with 19 participants. It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia, especially the indirectly related word pairs. In addition, implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected. Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs (ie, greater priming) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs. Performance on the directly related word pair tasks (both implicit and explicit) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions, except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task. This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia. Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6325","Ketamine and Other NMDA Antagonists: Early Clinical Trials and Possible Mechanisms in Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6427","NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia: an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI.^\nBACKGROUND: Based on animal data, NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia. NMDA receptor hypofunction affects several corticolimbic brain regions, of which the posterior cingulate seems to be the most sensitive. However, empirical support for a crucial role of posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms is still missing in humans. We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval, which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate. METHODS: We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either placebo (n = 7; saline) or ketamine (n = 9; 0.6 mg/kg/h) group in a double-blind study design. All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic memory retrieval task in the scanner. Immediately after the fMRI session, psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. RESULTS: The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and anterior cingulate during retrieval. Signal increases were significantly lower in the ketamine group. Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated significantly with positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms induced by ketamine. CONCLUSION: The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship between NMDA receptors, posterior cingulate and positive (i.e. psychosis-like) symptoms in humans. Confirming findings from animal studies, it supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg/kg ketamine. Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard (80%) and deviant tones (20%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear. Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy Ss that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"7041","Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^\nMethylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users. Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry (i.e., methylone is a β-keto analog of MDMA) and mechanisms of action. Currently, the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8219","Body mass index (BMI) does not predict responses to psilocybin.^\nBackground: Psilocybin is a serotonin type 2A (5-HT2A) receptor agonist and naturally occurring psychedelic. 5-HT2A receptor density is known to be associated with body mass index (BMI), however, the impact of this on psilocybin therapy has not been explored. While body weight-adjusted dosing is widely used, this imposes a practical and financial strain on the scalability of psychedelic therapy. This gap between evidence and practice is caused by the absence of studies clarifying the relationship between BMI, the acute psychedelic experience and long-term psychological outcomes. Method: Data were pooled across three studies using a fixed 25 mg dose of psilocybin delivered in a therapeutic context to assess whether BMI predicts characteristics of the acute experience and changes in well-being 2 weeks later. Supplementing frequentist analysis with Bayes Factors has enabled for conclusions to be drawn regarding the null hypothesis. Results: Results support the null hypothesis that BMI does not predict overall intensity of the altered state, mystical experiences, perceptual changes or emotional breakthroughs during the acute experience. There was weak evidence for greater ‘dread of ego dissolution’ in participants with lower BMI, however, further analysis suggested BMI did not meaningfully add to the combination of the other covariates (age, sex and study). While mystical-type experiences and emotional breakthroughs were strong predictors of improvements in well-being, BMI was not. Conclusions: These findings have important implications for our understanding of pharmacological and extra-pharmacological contributors to psychedelic-assisted therapy and for the standardization of a fixed therapeutic dose in psychedelic-assisted therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"8752","Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations. While these data are reassuring, it is important for each treatment case to fully explore potential cardiovascular risks prior to initiating treatment.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8910","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^\nRATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9039","Working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nCurrent and previous users of the drug MDMA ('ecstasy') were tested on measures of central executive functioning, information processing speed, and on self-report measures of arousal and anxiety. The results were compared with those for a control group who did not use MDMA. Relative to the control group, both user groups were found to be impaired in some aspects of central executive functioning. Also, there were significant group differences on the measures of anxiety (users were more anxious) and on arousal (previous users scoring higher on the arousal measure relative to current users). Users processed information as quickly as non-users but less accurately. Some possible mediators of the above group differences are discussed.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"9057","The use of the psychological flexibility model to support psychedelic assisted therapy.^\nPsychedelic assisted therapy comprises three stages: Preparation, Psychedelic Session, and Integration. Preparation is key for maximising the potential of a beneficial psychedelic experience and integration is important for prolonging improvements. The psychological flexibility model (PFM) appears to be a promising one to guide psychedelic preparation and integration. This paper proposes a model that utilises the PFM as informed by a previously published qualitative study of patient accounts of change processes in psilocybin therapy that identified themes of acceptance and connection as associated with positive outcomes. This new model, the ACE (Accept, Connect, Embody) model presents the six psychological flexibility processes, renamed and rearranged in an acceptance triad (defusion, present moment focus, willingness) and a connection triad (self as context, values, committed action). This paper describes the ACE model and how it is being used in an ongoing trial of psilocybin treatment for major depression. It also describes qualitative evidence supportive of the idea that psychological flexibility may be key to characterizing the processes of change involved in psilocybin assisted therapy for depression. These and other results suggest that psilocybin may be specifically increasing psychological flexibility and point to the possibility that psychotherapy approaches incorporating the PFM may serve as a means to deepen and extend the benefits of psilocybin treatment, thus bridging the experiential gap between a potent inner experience and an outer life better lived.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9611","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.
