The psychological effects of this drug are becoming better understood due to the growing research interest in identifying new potential therapeutic agents for the treatment of emotion dysregulation and other disorders. Previous studies suggest that ayahuasca enhances mindfulness-related capacities (decentering, non-judging, non-reacting and acceptance) and emotion regulation. The aim of the present exploratory study was to determine the effects of ayahuasca on self-compassion in a community sample. METHODS: We administered validated questionnaires (the Self-Compassion Scale-Short Form and Forms of Self-Criticism and Self-Reassurance) to evaluate pre-post changes in self-compassion and self-criticism/self-reassurance in 45 volunteers (27 women; 60%) before and after (\u226424\u00a0h) an ayahuasca ceremony. Most participants (n\u00a0=\u00a029; 67.4%) had previously used ayahuasca. RESULTS: Ayahuasca resulted in significant improvements, with medium to large effect sizes (\u03b7(2) \u00a0=\u00a00.184-0.276), in measures of self-compassion (p\u00a0<\u00a00.05), self-criticism (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01) and self-reassurance (p\u00a0<\u00a00.01). CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study suggest that ayahuasca promotes well-being and self-compassion, which could have a therapeutic effect on individuals with negative affect and other psychopathological conditions. Large, controlled studies are needed to confirm these findings."}

Unlike traditional drugs, it yields immediate effects, most likely via increased glutamatergic transmission and synaptic plasticity. However, ketamine administration in humans is systemic and its long-term impact on blood parameters has not yet been described in clinical studies. Here we investigated potential sustained effects of ketamine administration (0.5\u202fmg/kg ketamine racemate) on hematological and biochemical values in plasma and serum in a randomized double-blinded study. 80 healthy young participants were included and whole blood samples were collected 5 days before, and 14 days after the infusion. To assess the group effect, repeated measure analyses of co-variance (rmANCOVA) were conducted for the following blood parameters: levels of sodium, potassium, calcium, hemoglobin and number of erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and thrombocytes. RmANCOVA revealed a significant time by treatment effect on thrombocyte levels (F(1, 74) = 13.54, p < 0.001, eta = 0.155), driven by an increase in the ketamine group (paired t-test, t = -3.51, df = 38, p = 0.001). Specificity of thrombocyte effect was confirmed by logistic regression, and in addition, no other coagulation parameters showed significant interaction. Moreover, the relative increase in the ketamine group was stable across sexes and not predicted by age, BMI, smoking, alcohol or drug use, and contraception. Our results describe aftereffects of sub-anesthetic ketamine administration on blood coagulation parameters, which should be considered especially when targeting psychiatric populations with relevant clinical comorbidities."}

Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 \u03bcg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0\u20138, 8\u201316 and 16\u201324 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration\u2013subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6\u20132.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0\u20133.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 \u03bcg LSD, respectively.

However, concerns over ketamine's potential neurocognitive side effects have yet to be assessed in this population. The current study investigated 1) changes in neurocognitive performance after a repeated ketamine dosing regimen and 2) baseline neurocognitive performance as a predictor of ketamine treatment effect. METHOD: Veterans with comorbid PTSD and MDD (N\u00a0=\u00a015) received six infusions of 0.5\u00a0mg/kg ketamine over a 12-day period. Neurocognitive and clinical outcomes assessments occurred at baseline and within 7\u00a0days of infusion-series completion using the CogState battery. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions did not significantly worsen any measures of cognition. Rather, significant improvement was observed in working memory following completion of the infusion series. In addition, greater improvements in PTSD and MDD symptoms were associated with lower working memory, slower processing speed and faster set shifting at baseline. Lower verbal learning was also predictive of improvement in depression. LIMITATIONS: This study applied an open-label design without a placebo control. As such, it is not known to what extent the correlations or improvement in neurocognitive performance may have occurred under placebo conditions. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to examine the neurocognitive effects of repeated ketamine in participants with comorbid PTSD and MDD.

Potential influences of past environments, however, have received little attention. AIMS: To investigate how previous environmental stimuli shaped the experiences of patients receiving ketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), and develop the concept of \"imprinting\" to account for such time-lagged effects across diverse hallucinogenic drugs. METHODS: Recordings of treatment sessions and phenomenological interviews from 26 participants of a clinical trial investigating serial intravenous ketamine infusions for TRD, conducted from January 2021 to August 2022, were retrospectively reviewed. A broad literature search was undertaken to identify potentially underrecognized examples of imprinting with both serotonergic and atypical psychedelics, as well as analogous cognitive processes and neural mechanisms. RESULTS: In naturalistic single-subject experiments of a 28-year-old female and a 34-year-old male, subjective ketamine experiences were significantly altered by varying exposures to particular forms of digital media in the days preceding treatments. Higher levels of media exposure reduced the mystical/emotional qualities of subsequent psychedelic ketamine experiences, overpowering standard intention-setting practices and altering therapeutic outcomes. Qualitative data from 24 additional patients yielded eight further spontaneous reports of past environmental exposures manifesting as visual hallucinations during ketamine experiences. We identified similar examples of imprinting with diverse psychoactive drugs in past publications, including in the first-ever report of ketamine in human subjects, as well as analogous processes known to underly dreaming. CONCLUSIONS/INTERPRETATION: Past environmental exposures can significantly influence the phenomenology and therapeutic outcomes of psychedelic experiences, yet are underrecognized and understudied. To facilitate future research, we propose expanding the contextual model of psychedelic drug actions to incorporate imprinting, a novel concept that may aid clinicians, patients, and researchers to better understand psychedelic drug effects.

Grunebaum, James W. Murrough, Colleen Loo, Andrea Cipriani and Keith Hawton (Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 2020[Jan], Vol 54[1], 29-45). In the original article, a statement regarding conflicts of interest should have been included by the author Dr. James W Murrough. This was an inadvertent omission on the part of the author. The statement is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-80175-007[/rid]). Objective: Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression. But it is not known how quickly this occurs and how long it persists. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of ketamine for suicidality. Method: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched until 12 December 2018. Randomised controlled trials of ketamine or esketamine reporting data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, attempted or completed suicide in adults diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = \u22120.51, 95% confidence interval = [\u22121.00, \u22120.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = \u22120.63, 95% confidence interval = [\u22120.99, \u22120.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = \u22120.57, 95% confidence interval = [\u22120.99, \u22120.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

This pharmacologically complex tea, commonly obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an orally labile psychedelic agent showing 5-hydroxytryptamine2A agonist activity, with monoamine oxidase (MAO)-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids (harmine, harmaline, and tetrahydroharmine). Eighteen volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics received single oral doses of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca (0.6 and 0.85 mg of DMT/kg of body weight) and placebo. Ayahuasca produced significant subjective effects, peaking between 1.5 and 2 h, involving perceptual modifications and increases in ratings of positive mood and activation. Diastolic blood pressure showed a significant increase at the high dose (9 mm Hg at 75 min), whereas systolic blood pressure and heart rate were moderately and nonsignificantly increased. Cmax values for DMT after the low and high ayahuasca doses were 12.14 ng/ml and 17.44 ng/ml, respectively. Tmax (median) was observed at 1.5 h after both doses. The Tmax for DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects. Drug administration increased urinary normetanephrine excretion, but, contrary to the typical MAO-inhibitor effect profile, deaminated monoamine metabolite levels were not decreased. This and the negligible harmine plasma levels found suggest a predominantly peripheral (gastrointestinal and liver) site of action for harmine. MAO inhibition at this level would suffice to prevent first-pass metabolism of DMT and allow its access to systemic circulation and the central nervous system."}

MATERIALS AND METHODS: The subjective and physiological effects of 1.5 mg/kg MDMA were evaluated after 20 mg fluoxetine in eight recreational MDMA users in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study. During phase 1, participants were maintained on placebo for at least 5 days and tested with MDMA and placebo on separate sessions. In phase 2, the procedure was the same except fluoxetine was administered daily for at least 5 days. During sessions, placebo or fluoxetine was given 1 h before the session drug and effects were measured over the next 7 h. RESULTS: MDMA increased positive-like subjective effects on all the Addiction Research Center Inventory scales; Arousal, Elation, Positive Mood, and Vigor on the Profile of Mood States; Drug Liking, Friendly, Good Drug Effect, High, Stimulated, and Talkative on the Visual Analog Scale; and End-of-Session Liking and Crossover Point on the Multiple Choice Procedure. MDMA also increased measures of anxiety. On the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale, all scales except Volition were increased. MDMA also increased blood pressure and heart rate. Fluoxetine treatment attenuated most of the positive-like subjective effects including the Affect and Soma scales of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. In addition, heart rate but not blood pressure increases were reduced. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that blockade of 5-HT reuptake by fluoxetine can dampen the effects of MDMA and further supports the role of 5-HT in its behavioral effects in humans."}

To test this hypothesis, we first administered a sub-anaesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.006 mg/kg/min) or saline in a single-blind crossover design in 14 participants while magnetoencephalographic data were recorded during a visual task. In addition, magnetoencephalographic data were obtained in a sample of unmedicated first-episode psychosis patients (n = 10) and in patients with chronic schizophrenia (n = 16) to allow for comparisons of neuronal dynamics in clinical populations versus NMDAR hypofunctioning. Magnetoencephalographic data were analysed at source-level in the 1-90 Hz frequency range in occipital and thalamic regions of interest. In addition, directed functional connectivity analysis was performed using Granger causality and feedback and feedforward activity was investigated using a directed asymmetry index. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Acute ketamine administration in healthy volunteers led to similar effects on cognition and psychopathology as observed in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients. However, the effects of ketamine on high-frequency oscillations and their connectivity profile were not consistent with these observations. Ketamine increased amplitude and frequency of gamma-power (63-80 Hz) in occipital regions and upregulated low frequency (5-28 Hz) activity. Moreover, ketamine disrupted feedforward and feedback signalling at high and low frequencies leading to hypo- and hyper-connectivity in thalamo-cortical networks. In contrast, first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients showed a different pattern of magnetoencephalographic activity, characterized by decreased task-induced high-gamma band oscillations and predominantly increased feedforward/feedback-mediated Granger causality connectivity. Accordingly, the current data have implications for theories of cognitive dysfunctions and circuit impairments in the disorder, suggesting that acute NMDAR hypofunction does not recreate alterations in neural oscillations during visual processing observed in schizophrenia."}

Psychedelics, known to affect perception and cognition, seem to change language, but a systematic, time-dependent exploration is lacking. Therefore, we aimed at mapping the psychedelic effects on language over the time course of the acute and sub-acute effects in an explorative manner. For this, 24 healthy volunteers (age [mean\u00b1SD, range]: 35\u00b111, 25-61 years; 33% women) received 50\u00a0\u03bcg lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or inactive placebo in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. We assessed different language productions (experience reporting, storytelling), components (structure, semantics, vocabulary) and time points (+0\u00a0h to +24\u00a0h). Language productions included 5-min experience reporting (+1.5\u00a0h, +6.5\u00a0h) and 1-min storytelling (+0\u00a0h, +2\u00a0h, +4\u00a0h, +6\u00a0h, +24\u00a0h). Language structure was assessed by computing speech topology (SpeechGraphs), semantics by semantic distances (FastText), vocabulary by word categories (LIWC). LSD, compared to placebo, changed language structure, including decreased verbosity, lexicon, global and local connectivity (+1.5\u00a0h to +4\u00a0h); decreased semantic distances between neighbouring words and overall words (+2\u00a0h to +24\u00a0h); and changed vocabulary related to grammar, persons, time, space and biological processes (+1.5\u00a0h to +24\u00a0h). In conclusion, low to moderate LSD doses changed language over diverse production types, components and time points. While simpler and disconnected structure and semantic similarity might reflect cognitive impairments, changed vocabulary might reflect subjective perceptions. Therefore, language under LSD might provide a window into the psychedelic mind and automated language quantifications should be better explored as valuable tools to yield more unconstrained insights into psychedelic perception and cognition."}

In line with psychotherapeutic research, qualitative research has highlighted the role of reductions in experiential avoidance (and increases in connectedness) within psilocybin therapy. However, no quantitative research has examined experiential avoidance as a mechanism underlying psilocybin therapy's therapeutic effects. METHOD: Data was used from a double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared psilocybin therapy (two 25\u00a0mg psilocybin session plus daily placebo for six weeks) with escitalopram (two 1\u00a0mg psilocybin sessions plus 10-20\u00a0mg daily escitalopram for six weeks) among individuals with major depressive disorder (N\u00a0=\u00a059). All participants received psychological support. Experiential avoidance, connectedness, and treatment outcomes were measured at pre-treatment and at a 6\u00a0week primary endpoint. Acute psilocybin experiences and psychological insight were also measured. RESULTS: With psilocybin therapy, but not escitalopram, improvements in mental health outcomes (i.e., well-being, depression severity, suicidal ideation, and trait anxiety) occurred via reductions in experiential avoidance. Exploratory analyses suggested that improvements in mental health (except for suicidal ideation) via reduction in experiential avoidance were serially mediated through increases in connectedness. Additionally, experiences of ego dissolution and psychological insight predicted reductions in experiential avoidance following psilocybin therapy. LIMITATIONS: Difficulties inferring temporal causality, maintaining blindness to condition, and reliance upon self-report. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide support for the role of reduced experiential avoidance as a putative mechanism underlying psilocybin therapy's positive therapeutic outcomes. The present findings may help to tailor, refine, and optimize psilocybin therapy and its delivery."}

Comparisons between patients at baseline and controls (N = 18, mean age=36.11 \u00b1 14.5 SD, 57% female) established normalization of treatment effects. Results showed increased regional CBF in the cingulate and primary and higher-order visual association regions after first ketamine treatment. Baseline CBF in the fusiform, and acute changes in CBF in visual areas were related to symptom improvement after single and repeated ketamine treatment, respectively. In contrast, after serial infusion therapy, decreases in regional CBF were observed in the bilateral hippocampus and right insula with ketamine treatment. Findings demonstrate that neurophysiological changes occurring with single and repeated ketamine treatment follow both a regional and temporal pattern including sensory and limbic regions. Initial changes are observed in the posterior cingulate and precuneus and primary and higher-order visual areas, which relate to clinical responses. However, repeated exposure to ketamine, though not relating to clinical outcome, appears to engage deeper limbic structures and insula. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"}

OBJECTIVES: The current study used a within-participant design to assess the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA on speech. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven recreational users of amphetamines completed this inpatient, within-participant, double-blind study, during which they received placebo, methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), and MDMA (100 mg) on separate days. Following drug administration, study participants described movies viewed the previous evening and completed mood scales. RESULTS: Methamphetamine increased quantity of speech, fluency, and self-ratings of talkativeness and alertness, while it decreased the average duration of nonjuncture unfilled pauses. MDMA decreased fluency and increased self-ratings of inability to concentrate. To determine if methamphetamine- and MDMA-related effects were perceptible, undergraduates listened to the participants' movie descriptions and rated their coherence and the speaker's mood. Following methamphetamine, descriptions were judged to be more coherent and focused than they were following MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine improved verbal fluency and MDMA adversely affected fluency. This pattern of effects is consistent with the effects of these drugs on functioning in other cognitive domains. In general, methamphetamine effects on speech were inconsistent with effects popularly attributed to this drug, while MDMA-related effects were in agreement with some anecdotal reports and discordant with others."}

Objective: We tested for evidence of cognitive deficits and changes in brain function in a pilot sample of adolescent MDMA users, who were compared with adolescent non-users of MDMA. Methods: Selective and divided attention and verbal working memory were examined in six adolescent MDMA users and six non- users of MDMA who were similar in age, gender, IQ, and other substance use. Brain function was assessed during performance of the working memory task using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Results: MDMA users had significantly prolonged reaction times during tests of selective and divided attention, and failed to deactivate the left hippocampus normally during high verbal working memory load. Conclusions: MDMA use in adolescence may be associated with cognitive impairments and dysfunction of inhibitory circuits within the hippocampus.

COVID\u201019 has accelerated the rate of new anxiety diagnoses and exacerbated pre\u2010existing diagnoses of anxiety in individuals worldwide. The effectiveness of full dose psilocybin for treatment of anxiety and depression has been shown in a number of clinical trials. While there is a significant evidence of clinical efficacy of full dose psilocybin, acute effects of the dose result in a significant impairment \u2010 perceptual and sensory distortions incapacitating the patient for the duration of drug activity. Recent work suggests while not producing perceptual changes, micro\u2010dosing may indeed be associated with improved mood and enhanced well\u2010being. The practice of micro\u2010dosing is gaining popularity in the general population, while clinical data on its safety and efficacy is lacking. This will be a novel randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study aimed at establishment of safety and anxiolytic efficacy of psilocybin PSIL428 administered in a micro\u2010dosing regimen (2\u20105% of a full therapeutic dose) to adults suffering from depression or anxiety. The primary outcome of this study is the change in anxiety and/or depression levels from screening to week 16. Participant anxiety levels will be monitored through Beck Anxiety inventory, depression levels \u2010 through Beck Depression Inventory forms on a bi\u2010weekly basis across the course of the study. Study Drug PSIL428 is an experimental intervention and the active ingredient psilocybin is botanically derived. Similar interventions are currently undergoing Phase IIb/III clinical trials in international jurisdictions. It is being assessed for treatment of depressive disorders. Typically psilocybin used in full therapeutic doses associated with significant acute adverse effects.

The micro\u2010dosing practice is gaining significant popularity world\u2010wide, however evidence\u2010based data around it is minimal. Risks and benefits associated with the trial are not definitively established, however existing pre\u2010clinical and clinical data around full\u2010dose use of the drug carries a favorable risk\u2010benefit potential. The trial will be conducted in accordance with the most recently acceptable version of the Declaration of Helsinki, Good Clinical Practice (GCP) according to International Conference on Harmonization (ICH) guidelines, and applicable Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs). The trial will be conducted under a protocol reviewed and approved by an IRB; the trial will be conducted by scientifically and medically qualified persons; the benefits of the study are in proportion to the risks; the rights and welfare of the subjects will be respected; each subject will give his or her written informed consent before any protocol\u2010driven tests or evaluations are performed. The investigators are responsible for obtaining informed consent in adherence to GCP and according to applicable regulations prior to entering the subject into the trial.

Intravenous (IV) ketamine has been previously used to treat various refractory pain conditions. We present a series of patients with refractory migraine treated with intravenous ketamine in the hospital setting. Methods: Based on retrospective chart review, we identified six patients with refractory migraine admitted from 2010 through 2014 for treatment with intravenous ketamine. Ketamine was administered using a standard protocol starting with a dose of 0.1 mg/kg/hr and increased by 0.1 mg/kg/hr every 3 to 4 h as tolerated until the target pain score of 3/10 was achieved and maintained for at least 8 h. Visual Analogue Scale (VAS) scores at time of hospital admission were obtained as well as average baseline VAS scores prior to ketamine infusion. A phone interview was conducted for follow-up of migraine response in the 3 to 6 months following ketamine infusion. Results: The study sample had a median age of 36.5 years (range 29\u201354) and 83% were women. Pre-treatment pain scores ranged from 9 to 10. All patients achieved a target pain level of 3 or less for 8 h; the average ketamine infusion rate at target was 0.34 mg/kg/hour (range 0.12\u20130.42 mg/kg/hr). One patient reported a transient out-of-body hallucination following an increase in the infusion rate, which resolved after decreasing the rate. There were no other significant side effects. Conclusion: IV ketamine was safely administered in the hospital setting to patients with refractory chronic migraine. Treatment was associated with short term improvement in pain severity in 6 of 6 patients with refractory chronic migraine. Prospective placebo-controlled trials are needed to assess short term and long-term efficacy of IV ketamine in refractory chronic migraine.

In the present imaging study, we investigated decision-making and associated neuronal activation in three groups differing in their exposure to amphetamine and MDMA. An established paradigm on risky choices was used to evaluate decision-making performance and corresponding functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) activation. Subjects could choose between a low-risk control gamble and an experimental gamble, which always differed in the probability of winning or losing, as well as the magnitudes of monetary gain or loss. Experienced users (EU), users with low exposure to stimulants and drug-naive controls, did not differ from each other in behavioral performance. In accordance with our hypotheses, the anticipation of reward led to an activation of primarily the frontal cortex and the striatum in low-exposure users and drug-naive controls. In contrast, frontal and parietal activation was observed in all groups when the actual outcome of an experimental gamble was presented. EU displayed more activation compared to both control groups when there was a high probability of winning. The study at hand supports the hypothesis that neuronal activation patterns might even differ between drug users and healthy controls when no behavioral deficits are apparent. In EU, the probability of the occurrence of an event has more influence on neuronal activation than on the actual magnitude of reinforcing properties of this event."}

More recently neuroimaging has been used to corroborate these deficits. The present study aimed to assess multitasking performance in ecstasy polydrug users, polydrug users and drug-naive individuals. It was predicted that ecstasy polydrug users would perform worse than non-users on the behavioural measure and this would be supported by differences in cortical blood oxygenation. METHOD: In the study, 20 ecstasy-polydrug users, 17 polydrug users and 19 drug-naive individuals took part. On day 1, drug use history was taken and questionnaire measures were completed. On day 2, participants completed a 20-min multitasking stressor while brain blood oxygenation was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the three groups on the subscales of the multitasking stressor. In addition, there were no significant differences on self-report measures of perceived workload (NASA Task Load Index). In terms of mood, ecstasy users were significantly less calm and less relaxed compared with drug-naive controls. There were also significant differences at three voxels on the fNIRS, indicating decreased blood oxygenation in ecstasy users compared with drug-naive controls at voxel 2 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), voxel 14 and voxel 16 (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and compared with polydrug controls at V14. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide support for changes in brain activation during performance of demanding tasks in ecstasy polydrug users, which could be related to cerebral vasoconstriction."}

Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future."}

METHODS: Twelve subjects with treatment-resistant non-psychotic unipolar or bipolar major depression and suicidal ideation were given repeated (up to 6) thrice-weekly acute-phase intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5mg/kg, administered over 100min). Those who remitted during acute-phase treatment received continuation-phase treatment that consisted of 4 weekly ketamine infusions, followed by 4 weeks of post-continuation phase follow-up (during which no further ketamine infusions were administered). Clinical measures were assessed at baseline, at 24h following each infusion, at the last acute-phase observation, and during continuation and post-continuation follow-up (acute phase remitters only). RESULTS: Of the 12 enrollees, 5 (41.7%) remitted and 7 (58.3%) responded to ketamine treatment during the acute-phase. All five subjects who remitted during the acute-phase experienced further depressive symptom improvement during continuation-phase treatment. Four subjects lost remission status during the post-continuation phase, but all were still classified as positive treatment responders at the end of the post-continuation phase. Adverse effects were generally mild and transient during acute- and continuation-phase treatment; however, one subject developed behavioral outbursts and suicide threats during follow-up while hospitalized, and one subject died by suicide several weeks after the end of follow-up. LIMITATIONS: This was an uncontrolled feasibility study with a small sample size. CONCLUSIONS: The continuation-phase administration of ketamine at weekly intervals to patients with treatment-resistant depression who remitted during acute-phase ketamine treatment can extend the duration of depressive symptom remission. The antidepressive effect of ketamine persisted for several weeks after the end of continuation-phase treatment. Our results highlight the need for close monitoring of subjects who are at high baseline risk for suicide but do not respond clinically to ketamine. CLINICALTRIALS. GOV IDENTIFIER: NCT02094898."}

Previous studies have found that both mindfulness and psychedelics like psilocybin modulate neural activity and connectivity of the same brain network. However, little is known about the potential interactions between mindfulness meditation and psychedelics. The indigenous plant preparation \"Ayahuasca\" is particularly interesting for the combination with mindfulness meditation. It contains two components, N,N\u2010dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmine, which are very similar to the body's own messenger substance serotonin and increase its effect in the body. The investigators would now like to find out how these corresponding networks change in experienced meditators after DMT/Harmine\u2010enhanced mindfulness meditation and how this affects their subjective experience. For this functional MRI imaging will be performed, as well as psychometric assessments and detailed experiential interviews before and after a three\u2010day meditation retreat. Participants will be randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group receives DMT and harmine during the sitting meditation on the second day, the other group receives a corresponding placebo. Neither the participants nor the investigator know who will receive a placebo or the combination of DMT/harmine on the day of the experiment. The pre\u2010 and post\u2010measurements of the MRI imaging and psychometric questionnaires of the DMT/Harmine group are compared with those of the placebo control group. By examining the synergistic effects of mindfulness meditation and DMT/harmine, the aim of this study is to contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the neurophenomenology of rare and inaccessible phenomena of consciousness."}

Our aim was to explore the applicability of using clinical factors and serum tryptophan (TRP) metabolites to predict the response to six doses of ketamine for depression with suicidal ideation. Methods: Seventy-three depressed patients with suicidal ideation received a thrice-weekly infusion regimen of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and serum levels of TRP, kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and day 1 (1 day after the first infusion). The potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: The area under the curve (AUC = 0.959) implied a good accuracy of the combination of early clinical response and day 1 KYN and KYNA levels as a predictor of acute antidepressant response. The combination of early clinical response and day 1 KYNA levels showed moderate discrimination of acute antisuicidal response with an AUC of 0.825 and short-term antidepressant response with an AUC of 0.813. Limitations: The patients continued receiving previous medications during ketamine treatment, which may have impacted the TRP metabolites. Conclusion: The combination of early clinical response and TRP metabolites at the early stage of repeated ketamine treatment could be considered an eligible predictor for acute- and short-term response for treating depression with suicidal ideation.

Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20098) or inactive placebo (0\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20094) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1\u00a0month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d\u2009=\u20091.4, CI -\u20090.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P\u2009=\u20090.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI -\u20090.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety.

The present study was designed to assess the acute effects of MDMA and alcohol, alone and in combination, on behavioral measures of impulsivity and risk-taking behavior. A total of 18 recreational users of MDMA entered a double-blind placebo-controlled six-way crossover study. The treatments consisted of MDMA 0, 75, and 100 mg with and without alcohol. Alcohol dosing was designed to achieve a peak blood alcohol concentration (BAC) of about 0.06 g/dl during laboratory testing. Laboratory tests of impulsivity were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h post-MDMA and included a stop-signal task, a go/no-go task, and the Iowa gambling task. MDMA decreased stop reaction time in the stop-signal task indicating increased impulse control. Alcohol increased the proportion of commission errors in the stop-signal task and the go/no-go task. Signal detection analyses of alcohol-induced commission errors indicated that this effect may reflect impairment of perceptual or attentive processing rather than an increase of motor impulsivity per se. Performance in the Iowa gambling task was not affected by MDMA and alcohol, but there was a nonsignificant tendency towards improvement following alcohol intake. None of the behavioral measures of impulsivity showed a MDMA x alcohol interaction effect. The lack of interaction indicated that the CNS stimulant effects of MDMA were never sufficient to overcome alcohol-induced impairment of impulse control or risk-taking behavior."}

Large-scale evaluation of this approach is needed for questions regarding safety and effectiveness for depression and anxiety. METHODS: In this prospective study, a large outpatient sample received KAT over four weeks through a telehealth provider. Symptoms were assessed using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) for depression, and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD-7) for anxiety. Demographics, adverse events, and patient-reported dissociation were also analyzed. Symptom trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modeling, along with outcome predictors. RESULTS: A sample of 1247 completed treatment with sufficient data, 62.8\u00a0% reported a 50\u00a0% or greater improvement on the PHQ-9, d\u00a0=\u00a01.61, and 62.9\u00a0% on the GAD-7, d\u00a0=\u00a01.56.

Four patients left treatment early due to side effects or clinician disqualification, and two more due to adverse events. Three patient subpopulations emerged, characterized by Improvement (79.3\u00a0%), Chronic (11.4\u00a0%), and Delayed Improvement (9.3\u00a0%) for PHQ-9 and GAD-7. Endorsing side effects at Session 2 was associated with delayed symptom improvement, and Chronic patients were more likely than the other two groups to report dissociation at Session 4. CONCLUSION: At-home KAT response and remission rates indicated rapid and significant antidepressant and anxiolytic effects. Rates were consistent with laboratory- and clinic-administered ketamine treatment. Patient screening and remote monitoring maintained low levels of adverse events. Future research should assess durability of effects."}

The N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts, but the mechanism of action is unknown. This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine. METHODS: Thirty-four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM-IV major depressive disorder (n = 23) or bipolar depression (n = 11) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography (EEG) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes). Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures, including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item, the suicide item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation. A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness, as verified by EEG, between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not, controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness. Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls (n = 22). RESULTS: After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep, participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response (F\u2081,\u2082\u2082 = 5.04, P = .04). Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level (F\u2081,\u2084\u2080 = 3.15, P = .08).

RESULTS: Ketamine impaired balance when balance was assessed early in the task order, whereas triazolam impaired psychomotor coordination and divided attention irrespective of task order. Triazolam also tended to produce greater effects on working memory and episodic memory tasks than ketamine at doses that produced lower subjective effects and higher estimates of performance.

Importantly, it has been suggested that use of MDMA may be neurotoxic particularly for serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) neurons. In the past decades, several molecular imaging studies examined directly in vivo the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study is to review the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems as assessed by molecular imaging studies in small animals, non-human primates and humans. METHODS: A search in PubMed was performed. Eighty-eight articles were found on which inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria; all were focused on the 5-HT or dopamine (DA) system. Importantly, 9 out of 11 of the animal studies that examined the effects of MDMA on 5-HT transporter (SERT) availability showed a significant loss of binding potential. In human studies, this was the case for 14 out of 16 studies, particularly in heavy users. In abstinent users, significant recovery of SERT binding was found over time. Most imaging studies in humans that focused on the DA system did not find any significant effect of ecstasy/MDMA use. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical and clinical molecular imaging studies on the effects of ecstasy/MDMA use/administration on neurotransmitter systems show quite consistent alterations of the 5-HT system. Particularly, in human studies, loss of SERT binding was observed in heavy ecstasy users, which might reflect 5-HT neurotoxicity, although alternative explanations (e.g. down-regulation of the SERT) cannot be excluded."}

However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation."}

In contrast, GH responses to BROM stimulation were found significantly reduced in ecstasy users, in comparison with control subjects (P < 0.001; F = 6.26). MDMA users showed higher scores on the Novelty Seeking (NS) scale at the Three dimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ), on direct aggressiveness subscale at Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI), on subscale D (depression) at Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI 2) and on Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) than control subjects. PRL areas under the curves (AUCs) showed a significant inverse correlation with NS scores both in A and B subjects. GH AUCs directly correlated with NS scores in healthy subjects, but not in MDMA users. No other psychometric measure correlated with hormonal responses. GH AUCs were inversely correlated with the measures of MDMA exposure (r = -0.48; P < 0.01). Lower GH response to BROM in A subjects (MDMA users) could reflect reduced D2 receptor sensitivity in the hypothalamus, possibly due to increased intrasynaptic dopamine concentration. Although the hypothesis of dopaminergic changes associated with a premorbid condition cannot be completely excluded, the inverse correlation between DA receptors sensitivity and the extent of ecstasy exposure may suggest a direct pharmacological action of MDMA on brain dopamine function in humans."}

Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) was applied to examine serum BDNF levels in patients with TRD at baseline and after the second, fourth and eighth ECT sessions. Baseline serum samples were also collected for 30 healthy controls. RESULTS: No significant differences were observed in serum BDNF levels between patients with TRD and healthy controls at baseline (p > 0.05). The remission rate was 76.7% (23/30) after the last ECT treatment, although all patients with TRD obtained antidepressant response criteria. Serum BDNF levels were not altered compared to baseline, even between remitters and nonremitters (all p > 0.05), despite the significant reduction in HAMD-17 and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) scores after ECT with ketamine anaesthesia (all p < 0.05). The antidepressant effects of ECT with ketamine anaesthesia were not correlated with changes in serum BDNF levels (all p > 0.05). CONCLUSION: This preliminary study indicated that serum BDNF levels do not appear to be a reliable biomarker to determine the antidepressant effects of ketamine as an anaesthesia in ECT for patients with TRD. Further studies with larger sample sizes are warranted to confirm these findings."}

Esketamine administration (0.5 mg/kg, IV or SC) took 40 minutes, followed by an observation time of 2 hours. Blood pressure and emergent side effects were constantly monitored by a trained psychiatrist. The Montgomery\u2013\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess the severity of depressive symptoms (total score) and SI (item 10) before esketamine administration and after 24 hours. Records from 10 patients were included. Eight patients receive SC esketamine, whereas the remaining received IV. The mean age of the sample was 15.5 years. There was a significant reduction in depressive symptoms (mean total MADRS score) from baseline to 24-hour postadministration (39.1 \u00b1 6.30 to 26.8 \u00b1 8.40; mean difference = 12.3; t = 4.22; p = 0.002; d = 1.33). In addition, we found a significant decrease in SI (mean MADRS item 10 score) when comparing baseline and 24-hour results (5.0 \u00b1 1.16 to 2.7 \u00b1 1.95; mean difference = 2.3; t = 3.14; p = 0.011; d = 0.99). Most patients reported side effects only during esketamine ad ministration or following the observational period. Dissociation was the most frequently self-reported symptom (50%), followed by dizziness (40%) and drowsiness (30%). Side effects were considered mild to moderate since they were short-lived, and no patients had treatment-emergent SI or suicidal behavior. This is the first report of a rapid onset antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of esketamine in depressed adolescents. The few studies that investigated the antisuicidal effects of ketamine in this population used the racemate and were restricted to single case reports. Nonetheless, repeated ketamine infusions in adolescents with treatment-resistant depression appear to improve depressive symptoms and SI. The results suggest that a single dose of parenteral esketamine can rapidly reduce the severity of depression and SI symptoms in adolescents with MDD and SI. Regardless, larger adequately controlled studies are needed, in addition to the investigation of multiple administrations of esketamine, and its long-term safety for this age group in different aspects, such as cognitive impairment and risk of recreational use.

DESIGN: Four-session, ascending-dose, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial. SETTING: Urban hospital. PATIENTS: Eight healthy adults who self-reported MDMA use. INTERVENTION: Echocardiographic effects of dobutamine (5, 20, and 40 microg/kg of body weight per minute) were measured in a preliminary session. Oral MDMA (0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg of body weight) or placebo was administered 1 hour before echocardiographic measurements in three weekly sessions. MEASUREMENTS: Heart rate and blood pressure were measured at regular intervals before and after MDMA administration. Echocardiographic measures of stroke volume, ejection fraction, cardiac output, and meridional wall stress were obtained 1 hour after MDMA administration and during dobutamine infusions. RESULTS: At a dose of 1.5 mg/kg, MDMA increased mean heart rate (by 28 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (by 25 mm Hg), diastolic blood pressure (by 7 mm Hg), and cardiac output (by 2 L/min). The effects of MDMA were similar to those of dobutamine, 20 and 40 microg/kg per minute. Inotropism, measured by using meridional wall stress corrected for ejection fraction, decreased after administration of dobutamine, 40 microg/kg per minute, but did not change after either dose of MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Modest oral doses of MDMA increase heart rate, blood pressure, and myocardial oxygen consumption in a magnitude similar to dobutamine, 20 to 40 microg/kg per minute.

Despite this risk, the consistency and magnitude of symptoms induced by ketamine or what factors are associated with these symptoms remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the psychopathological outcomes associated with ketamine in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia and the experimental factors associated with these outcomes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO databases were searched for within-participant, placebo-controlled studies reporting symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in response to an acute ketamine challenge in healthy participants or patients with schizophrenia. STUDY SELECTION: Of 8464 citations retrieved, 36 studies involving healthy participants were included. Inclusion criteria were studies (1) including healthy participants; (2) reporting symptoms occurring in response to acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (racemic ketamine, s-ketamine, r-ketamine) intravenously; (3) containing a placebo condition with a within-subject, crossover design; (4) measuring total positive or negative symptoms using BPRS or PANSS; and (5) providing data allowing the estimation of the mean difference and deviation between the ketamine and placebo condition. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores were extracted. Subgroup analyses were conducted examining the effects of blinding status, ketamine preparation, infusion method, and time between ketamine and placebo conditions. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used as effect sizes for individual studies. Standardized mean differences between ketamine and placebo conditions were calculated for total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores. RESULTS: The overall sample included 725 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [3.6] years; 533 [73.6%] male) exposed to the ketamine and placebo conditions. Racemic ketamine or S-ketamine was associated with a statistically significant increase in transient psychopathology in healthy participants for total (SMD\u2009=\u20091.50 [95% CI,\u20091.23-1.77]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), positive (SMD\u2009=\u20091.55 [95% CI,\u20091.29-1.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and negative (SMD\u2009=\u20091.16 [95% CI,\u20090.96-1.35]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) symptom ratings relative to the placebo condition. The effect size for this association was significantly greater for positive than negative symptoms of psychosis (estimate, 0.36 [95% CI,\u20090.12-0.61]; P\u2009=\u2009.004). There was significant inconsistency in outcomes between studies (I2\u2009range,\u200977%-83%). Bolus followed by constant infusion increased ketamine's association with positive symptoms relative to infusion alone (effect size, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.90] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.35-1.33]; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Single-day study design increased ketamine's ability to generate total symptoms (effect size, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.69-2.89] vs 1.39 [95% CI, 1.12-1.66]; P\u2009=\u2009.007), but age and sex did not moderate outcomes. Insufficient studies were available for meta-analysis of studies in schizophrenia. Of these studies, 2 found a statistically significant increase in symptoms with ketamine administration in total and positive symptoms. Only 1 study found an increase in negative symptom severity with ketamine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that acute ketamine administration was associated with schizophrenia-like or psychotomimetic symptoms with large effect sizes, but there was a greater increase in positive than negative symptoms and when a bolus was used. These findings suggest that bolus doses should be avoided in the therapeutic use of ketamine to minimize the risk of inducing transient positive (psychotic) symptoms."}

The purpose of this secondary analysis was to evaluate reduction in SI with a single ketamine infusion compared with an active control, and prolonged suppression of SI with repeated and maintenance infusions. Thirty-seven participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and baseline SI first received a single ketamine infusion during a randomized, double-blind crossover with midazolam. Following relapse of depressive symptoms, participants received six open-label ketamine infusions administered thrice-weekly over 2 weeks. Antidepressant responders (\u226550% decrease in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] scores) received four further open-label infusions administered once-weekly. Changes in SI were assessed with the suicide items on the MADRS (item 10, MADRS-SI) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report (item 12, QIDS-SI). Linear mixed models revealed that compared with midazolam, a single ketamine infusion elicited larger reduction in SI (P\u2009=\u20090.01), with maximal effects measured at 7 days postinfusion (P\u2009<\u20090.001, Cohen's d\u2009=\u20090.83). Participants had cumulative reductions in MADRS-SI scores with repeated infusions (P\u2009<\u20090.001), and no further change with maintenance infusions (P\u2009=\u20090.94). QIDS-SI results were consistent with MADRS-SI. Overall, 69% of participants had a complete alleviation of SI following repeated infusions. In TRD, single and repeated ketamine infusions resulted in decreases in SI which were maintained with once-weekly maintenance infusions. This study adds to the growing body of research suggesting ketamine as a possible novel treatment strategy for SI in mood disorders."}

In most trials to date, psilocybin dose has been administered on a weight-adjusted basis rather than the more convenient procedure of administering a fixed dose. Aims: The present post hoc analyses sought to determine whether the subjective effects of psilocybin are affected by body weight when psilocybin is administered on a weight-adjusted basis and when psilocybin is administered as a fixed dose. Methods: We analyzed acute subjective drug effects (mystical, challenging, and intensity) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies (total N = 288) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg (inclusive). Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg (n = 120), participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg (n = 182), and participants whose weight-adjusted dose was about 25 mg (to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder) (n = 103). Results: In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight-adjusted groups, and in the fixed dose group, no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex. Across a wide range of body weights (49 to 113 kg) the present results showed no evidence that body weight affected subjective effects of psilocybin. Conclusions: These results suggest that the convenience and lower cost of administering psilocybin as a fixed dose outweigh any potential advantage of weight-adjusted dosing."}

Recent studies indicate that the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine and the 5-HT receptor agonist psilocybin are implicated in emotion processing. However, as yet, no study has systematically compared their contribution to emotional biases. OBJECTIVES: This study used event-related potentials (ERPs) and signal detection theory to compare the effects of the NMDA (via S-ketamine) and 5-HT (via psilocybin) receptor system on non-conscious or conscious emotional face processing biases. METHODS: S-ketamine or psilocybin was administrated to two groups of healthy subjects in a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design. We behaviorally assessed objective thresholds for non-conscious discrimination in all drug conditions. Electrophysiological responses to fearful, happy, and neutral faces were subsequently recorded with the face-specific P100 and N170 ERP. RESULTS: Both S-ketamine and psilocybin impaired the encoding of fearful faces as expressed by a reduced N170 over parieto-occipital brain regions. In contrast, while S-ketamine also impaired the encoding of happy facial expressions, psilocybin had no effect on the N170 in response to happy faces. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrates that the NMDA and 5-HT receptor systems differentially contribute to the structural encoding of emotional face expressions as expressed by the N170. These findings suggest that the assessment of early visual evoked responses might allow detecting pharmacologically induced changes in emotional processing biases and thus provides a framework to study the pathophysiology of dysfunctional emotional biases."}

At subanesthetic doses, it safely and reversibly causes delusion-like ideas, amotivation and perceptual disruptions reminiscent of the aberrant salience experiences that characterize first-episode psychosis. However, auditory verbal hallucinations, a hallmark symptom of schizophrenia, have not been reported consistently in healthy volunteers even at high doses of ketamine. SAMPLING AND METHODS: Here we present data from a set of healthy participants who received moderately dosed, placebo-controlled ketamine infusions in the reduced stimulation environment of the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. We highlight the phenomenological experiences of 3 participants who experienced particularly vivid hallucinations. RESULTS: Participants in this series reported auditory verbal and musical hallucinations at a ketamine dose that does not induce auditory hallucination outside of the scanner. CONCLUSIONS: We interpret the observation of ketamine-induced auditory verbal hallucinations in the context of the reduced perceptual environment of the MRI scanner and offer an explanation grounded in predictive coding models of perception and psychosis - the brain fills in expected perceptual inputs, and it does so more in situations of altered perceptual input. The altered perceptual input of the MRI scanner creates a mismatch between top-down perceptual expectations and the heightened bottom-up signals induced by ketamine. Such circumstances induce aberrant percepts, including musical and auditory verbal hallucinations. We suggest that these circumstances might represent a useful experimental model of auditory verbal hallucinations and highlight the impact of ambient sensory stimuli on psychopathology."}

We report on the clinical outcomes of a large cohort treated with ketamine as part of clinical practice. Methods: Deidentified electronic chart data were obtained from a multisite private ketamine infusion clinic for 424 patients with TRD seen from November 9, 2017, to May 4, 2021. Ketamine infusions were administered at a starting dose of 0.5 mg/kg/40 minutes for 6 infusions within 21 days. Maintenance infusions were offered based on clinical response. Changes in outcome measures (scores on the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 [PHQ-9] and Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 [GAD-7]) within subjects were analyzed using longitudinal multilevel modeling with Kaplan-Meier estimates. Logistic regression was used to analyze for a priori theorized potential moderators of response. Results: Significant improvements from baseline were observed over time on the main outcomes (all P\u2009<\u2009.001). Based on PHQ-9 self-report data, within 6 weeks of infusion initiation, a 50% response rate and 20% remission rate for depressive symptoms were observed. Response and remission rates were 72% and 38%, respectively, after 10 infusions, and there was a 50% reduction in self-harm/suicidal ideation (SI) symptom scores within 6 weeks. Half of patients with SI at baseline no longer had it after 6 infusions. A 30% reduction in anxiety symptoms (per the GAD-7) was observed. Conclusions: Ketamine was effective at reducing symptoms of SI, depression, and anxiety. The high rates of response and remission were similar to those for interventional treatments in community samples of TRD. Comparative efficacy trials with other interventions and randomized controlled trials of racemic ketamine infusion as the primary treatment for SI are needed."}

Previous studies with the serotonergic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin showed that these drugs reduced the recognition of negative (fear) faces in healthy volunteers. This trial assessed the acute and prolonged effects of a single dose of ayahuasca on the REFE. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy volunteers participated in a pilot, proof-of-concept, randomized trial. Study variables included a REFE task performed before and 4 hours after drug intake, subjective effects (self-reports/observer impressions), tolerability measures (cardiovascular measures, self-reports), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma levels. The REFE task was applied again 1, 7, 14, and 21 days and 3 months after drug intake. Stability of ayahuasca alkaloids during the study was also assessed (room temperature, 18 months). FINDINGS: Compared with placebo, ayahuasca did not modify the REFE. No significant effects were observed on cardiovascular measures and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Volunteers reported visual effects, tranquility/relaxation, and well-being, with few reports of transient anxiety/confusion. Ayahuasca was well tolerated, producing mainly nausea, gastrointestinal discomfort, and vomiting. A significant time-dependent deterioration of alkaloids was observed, especially for dimethyltryptamine. CONCLUSIONS: Absence of significant effects on the REFE task could be due to lack of effects of ayahuasca (at the doses used), alkaloid degradation, learning effects, and the high educational level of the sample. Further trials with different samples are needed to better understand the effects of ayahuasca and other serotonergic hallucinogens on the REFE. Future trials should improve methods to guarantee the stability of ayahuasca alkaloids."}

METHODS: We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile, pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationship, and urine recovery of lysergic acid diethylamide and its main metabolite after administration of a single oral dose of lysergic acid diethylamide (200 \u03bcg) in 8 male and 8 female healthy subjects. RESULTS: Plasma lysergic acid diethylamide concentrations were quantifiable (>0.1 ng/mL) in all the subjects up to 12 hours after administration. Maximal concentrations of lysergic acid diethylamide (mean\u00b1SD: 4.5\u00b11.4 ng/mL) were reached (median, range) 1.5 (0.5-4) hours after administration. Concentrations then decreased following first-order kinetics with a half-life of 3.6\u00b10.9 hours up to 12 hours and slower elimination thereafter with a terminal half-life of 8.9\u00b15.9 hours. One percent of the orally administered lysergic acid diethylamide was eliminated in urine as lysergic acid diethylamide, and 13% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-lysergic acid diethylamide within 24 hours. No sex differences were observed in the pharmacokinetic profiles of lysergic acid diethylamide. The acute subjective and sympathomimetic responses to lysergic acid diethylamide lasted up to 12 hours and were closely associated with the concentrations in plasma over time and exhibited no acute tolerance.

METHODS: Data sources were four phase III randomized, double-blind studies including two positive studies (acute flexible-dose; maintenance) in patients with TRD. Key efficacy study outcomes: acute response (\u226550% decrease from baseline on Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] total score), acute remission (MADRS scores \u226412). NNT, NNH were calculated for esketamine nasal spray+newly initiated oral antidepressant (esketamine+AD) vs. placebo+AD.

MDMA is hypothesized to facilitate the therapeutic process, in part, by decreasing fear response during fear memory processing while increasing extinction learning. The acute administration of MDMA in healthy controls modifies recruitment of brain regions involved in the hyperactive fear response in PTSD such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula. However, to date there have been no neuroimaging studies aimed at directly elucidating the neural impact of MDMA-AT in PTSD patients. METHODS: We analyzed brain activity and connectivity via functional MRI during both rest and autobiographical memory (trauma and neutral) response before and two-months after MDMA-AT in nine veterans and first-responders with chronic PTSD of 6 months or more. RESULTS: We hypothesized that MDMA-AT would increase amygdala-hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity, however we only found evidence of a trend in the left amygdala-left hippocampus (t = -2.91, uncorrected p = 0.0225, corrected p = 0.0901). We also found reduced activation contrast (trauma > neutral) after MDMA-AT in the cuneus. Finally, the amount of recovery from PTSD after MDMA-AT correlated with changes in four functional connections during autobiographical memory recall: the left amygdala-left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left amygdala-right PCC, left amygdala-left insula, and left isthmus cingulate-left posterior hippocampus. DISCUSSION: Amygdala-insular functional connectivity is reliably implicated in PTSD and anxiety, and both regions are impacted by MDMA administration. These findings compliment previous research indicating that amygdala, hippocampus, and insula functional connectivity is a potential target of MDMA-AT, and highlights other regions of interest related to memory processes. More research is necessary to determine if these findings are specific to MDMA-AT compared to other types of treatment for PTSD.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, induces a strong phMRI response and represents a promising pharmacological model to investigate the role of glutamatergic abnormalities in psychiatric symptomatology. The aim of this study was to assess whether the brain response to ketamine is reliable in order to validate ketamine phMRI as a mechanistic marker of glutamatergic dysfunction and to determine its utility in repeated measures designs to detect the modulatory effect of other drugs. Thus we assessed the test-retest reliability of the brain response to ketamine in healthy volunteers and identified an optimal modelling approach with reliability as our selection criterion. PhMRI data were collected from 10 healthy male participants, at rest, on two separate occasions. Subanaesthetic doses of I.V. ketamine infusion (target plasma levels 50 ng/mL and 75 ng/mL) were administered in both sessions. Test-retest reliability of the ketamine phMRI response was assessed voxel-wise and on pre-defined ROIs for a range of temporal design matrices including different combinations of nuisance regressors designed to model shape variance, linear drift and head motion. Effect sizes are also reported. All models showed a significant and widespread response to low-dose ketamine in predicted cerebral networks and as expected, increasing the number of model parameters improved model fit. Reliability of the predefined ROIs differed between the different models assessed. Using reliability as the selection criterion, a model capturing subject motion and linear drift performed the best across two sessions. The anatomical distribution of effects for all models was consistent with results of previous imaging studies in humans with BOLD signal increases in regions including midline cingulate and supracingulate cortex, thalamus, insula, anterior temporal lobe and ventrolateral prefrontal structures, and BOLD signal decreases in the subgenual cingulate cortex. This study represents the first investigation of the test-retest reliability of the BOLD phMRI response to acute ketamine challenge. All models tested were effective at describing the ketamine response although the design matrix associated with the highest reliability may represent a robust and well-characterised ketamine phMRI assay more suitable for repeated-measures designs. This ketamine assay is applicable as a model of neurotransmitter dysfunction suitable as a pharmacodynamic imaging tool to test and validate modulatory interventions, as a model of NMDA hypofunction in psychiatric disorders, and may be adapted to understand potential antidepressant and analgesic effects of NMDAR antagonists."}

Previous studies have suggested that their emergence may be explained by disturbances in prediction error-dependent learning. Here we set up complementary studies in order to examine whether such a disturbance also modulates memory reconsolidation and hence explains their remarkable persistence. First, we quantified individual brain responses to prediction error in a causal learning task in 18 human subjects (8 female). Next, a placebo-controlled within-subjects study of the impact of ketamine was set up on the same individuals. We determined the influence of this NMDA receptor antagonist (previously shown to induce aberrant prediction error signal and lead to transient alterations in perception and belief) on the evolution of a fear memory over a 72 hour period: they initially underwent Pavlovian fear conditioning; 24 hours later, during ketamine or placebo administration, the conditioned stimulus (CS) was presented once, without reinforcement; memory strength was then tested again 24 hours later. Re-presentation of the CS under ketamine led to a stronger subsequent memory than under placebo. Moreover, the degree of strengthening correlated with individual vulnerability to ketamine's psychotogenic effects and with prediction error brain signal. This finding was partially replicated in an independent sample with an appetitive learning procedure (in 8 human subjects, 4 female). These results suggest a link between altered prediction error, memory strength and psychosis. They point to a core disruption that may explain not only the emergence of delusional beliefs but also their persistence."}

Ketamine-only administration impaired psychomotor response speed (Simple and 5Choice) and impaired memory (all p < .001), however did not alter executive function abilities. Independent of sedation, co-administration of dexmedetomidine produced synergistic performance and memory deficits which persisted at post-treatment (KET/DEX) (all p < .001), and were comparatively greater than for KET/FENT (all p < .05). Ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine concentrations were modestly associated with reduced psychomotor speed and accuracy (all p < .05), and an inverse relationship was found between blood concentrations of ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine and performance on memory tasks. Co-administration of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not with fentanyl exerts synergistic effects on psychomotor performance and memory without executive dysfunction. Assessment of these effects in clinical groups is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"}

The aims of this clinical trial were to evaluate ketamine's antidepressive effects in ECT as a primary anesthetic, determine ketamine's tolerability when compared with standard anesthesia, and determine if plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary for treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults meeting criteria for treatment-resistant depression undergoing index course ECT received either methohexital (1 to 2\u2009mg/kg) or ketamine (1 to 2\u2009mg/kg) anesthesia in this dual-arm double-blinded randomized clinical trial (NCT02752724). The primary outcome of this study is change in depression questionnaire scores before and after ECT. Seizure data, depression severity using self-reported and clinician-assessed questionnaires, cognitive scoring, and plasma BDNF concentrations were obtained before and after completion of ECT. RESULTS: There were no differences in seizure lengths, hemodynamics, or seizure stimuli between the ketamine (n=23;138 ECTs) and methohexital (n=27;159 ECTs) groups. Depression scores improved similarly after ECT in both groups. In the methohexital group, 15% of patients failed to achieve adequate seizures and were switched to ketamine and 26% were converted to bilateral ECT stimulus, whereas all ketamine patients achieved adequate seizures and only 4% required bilateral stimulus. Plasma BDNF increased after ECT only in the ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ketamine does not significantly improve depression when compared with methohexital as a single induction agent for ECT, increases serum BDNF and does not increase rates of post-ECT agitation. Ketamine use in ECT may have some benefits for some patients that are not captured through standard depression assessment questionnaires alone."}

This previous work, however, has not taken into consideration the additional use of cannabis amongst those examined. Cannabis use has also been associated with memory impairment. There is therefore a clear need to explore the impact of both of these illicit substances upon memory ability. OBJECTIVES: To determine whether recreational use of ecstasy impairs memory and attentional ability and to explore the impact of the concomitant use of cannabis upon these cognitive functions. In addition, an exploration of subjective accounts of cognitive ability was undertaken to determine whether objective impairments were perceived by users in everyday functioning. METHODS: Cognitive functioning was examined in three groups of young people: 15 regular users of ecstasy; 15 regular users of cannabis who had never taken ecstasy and 15 control subjects who had never taken any illicit substances. The Weschler Memory Scale (revised) and a computerised reaction time task were administered on a day when the subjects claimed to be drug free. In addition, subjects completed a biographical questionnaire and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ) in order to assess subjective accounts of cognitive slips. RESULTS: Performance was similar across all three groups for measures of visual reaction time, auditory reaction time, complex reaction time, visual memory and attention and concentration. Significant impairment was found on measures of verbal memory in both cannabis users and ecstasy users. A significant impairment in performance was found on measures of delayed memory for the ecstasy users compared to both the cannabis group and the control group. Despite these findings, no differences in subjective ratings of cognitive failures were found between the groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present study provides additional evidence for longterm neuropsychological sequelae associated with the use of ecstasy, particularly with regard to delayed memory ability."}

We applied dynamic causal modeling and Bayesian model selection to data from a recent ketamine study of the roving MMN paradigm, using a cross-over, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Our modeling was guided by a predictive coding framework that unifies contemporary 'adaptation' and 'model adjustment' MMN theories. Comparing a series of dynamic causal models that allowed for different expressions of neuronal adaptation and synaptic plasticity, we obtained 3 major results: 1) We replicated previous results that both adaptation and short-term plasticity are necessary to explain MMN generation per se; 2) we found significant ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity, but not adaptation, and a selective ketamine effect on the forward connection from left primary auditory cortex to superior temporal gyrus; 3) this model-based estimate of ketamine effects on synaptic plasticity correlated significantly with ratings of ketamine-induced impairments in cognition and control. Our modeling approach thus suggests a concrete mechanism for ketamine effects on MMN that correlates with drug-induced psychopathology. More generally, this demonstrates the potential of modeling for inferring on synaptic physiology, and its pharmacological modulation, from electroencephalography data.

Predicting whether a specific treatment will be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms for a particular patient is difficult, and identifying measurable biological markers, or biomarkers, that could be assessed in individuals to help identify an effective treatment would be valuable. Previous research has used neuroimaging measures at baseline to test for potential correlations with treatment response in depression. Neural biomarkers of response may be challenging to identify for most pharmacological treatments for MDD, due to the length of time it takes for many antidepressants to show effects (potentially several weeks). The rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, make this compound well\u2010suited for investigating biomarkers that correlate with treatment response. We examined blood\u2010oxygen\u2010level dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI) during an emotional processing task in patients with MDD to determine if pretreatment activation correlated with subsequent antidepressant response after ketamine. Methods: Participants included 31 patients with MDD, ages 18 to 65, who took part in this study as part of a large doubleblind placebo\u2010controlled protocol on the mechanism of action of ketamine. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after participants received an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). At baseline, BOLD signal was measured using a 3T GE fMRI scanner during an emotional processing task. In this mixed block/event\u2010related task, participants viewed faces with emotional expressions (angry, sad, neutral, and happy), randomly presented either rightside up or upside\u2010down. Participants were instructed to press a button to judge the emotion in one block and to identify the gender in the other block. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed using AFNI. Preprocessing included despiking, aligning images, registering echo\u2010planar to structural images, blurring to 6 mm, normalizing, and motion correction. Firstlevel individual analyses were conducted using regressors for each stimulus and block type. Group analysis used a multivariate model with the task factors and with a quantitative variable for the percent change in MADRS score from baseline to one day after the ketamine infusion. Results were thresholded at p<0.05, family wise error corrected (with voxel\u2010wise p<0.01). Results: We found a significant correlation between BOLD signal during the emotional processing task at baseline and percent change in MADRS score after ketamine. This was found in a large cluster in the left insula, extending into left inferior and middle frontal gyri, as well as in a cluster in the right precuneus. For both regions, greater activation at baseline was associated with better antidepressant response to ketamine (decrease in MADRS score of depressive symptoms). This was found across the entire task, not related to any specific task factors. We did not find any brain areas that showed the opposite pattern of greater activation correlating with poorer response. Conclusions: Our findings showed that pretreatment brain activity was correlated with response to ketamine, with the most significant result found in the left insula. The insula plays a role in emotional processing and has been previously associated with neuroimaging findings related to depression. While prior research has shown some associations between insula activation and response to other medications, there have been mixed findings. This could be related to different tasks being used or differential response depending on the specific treatment. Using functional neuroimaging as a biomarker to predict the likelihood of antidepressant response to ketamine would be greatly beneficial for patients with MDD. This would also be a valuable way for clinicians to work towards individualized treatment for psychiatric il ness."}

Objectives: We examined whether change in ecstasy use was associated with change in depressive symptoms/probable depression over a 4-year period, among a large Australian sample. Methods: The Personality and Total Health project is a longitudinal general community study of Australians from Canberra and Queanbeyan. Data from the youngest cohort when aged 24-30 (N = 2, 128) and 4 years later (N = 1, 977) was included. The Goldberg depression scale and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire measured depressive symptoms and probable depression, respectively. Multilevel growth models also considered demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and other drug use. Results: Ecstasy use was not associated with long-term depressive symptoms or greater odds of depression in multivariate analyses. Users had more self-reported depressive symptoms when using ecstasy compared to not using. However, differences between people who had and had not ever used ecstasy largely accounted for this. Other factors were more important in the prediction of depression. Conclusions: It would be premature to conclude that ecstasy use is not related to the development of long-term depressive symptoms, given the relatively low level of ecstasy and other drug use in this community sample. Results showed that other factors need to be considered when investigating ecstasy use and depression. \u00a9 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."}

The present investigation compares self-reports of psychobiological difficulties among ecstasy users recruited either via a bulletin board or by alternative methods. Qualitative data included reports of any negative or positive changes attributable to ecstasy use and reasons for cessation of use. An Internet-based design was utilized and 209 volunteers completed the study, 117 of whom were recruited via a bulletin board devoted to discussion of ecstasy. Psychobiological difficulties attributable to ecstasy use varied, with mood fluctuation the most common. Differences between the two groups in the extent to which these problems were reported was found. Bulletin board recruits were less likely to report anxiety or poor concentration, but more likely to report tremors/twitches. For the whole sample, lifetime use was associated more with psychobiologial problems, although this pattern was stronger and more pervasive for the non-bulletin board participants. Bulletin board recruits were more aware of possible negative psychological effects and were more likely to report adopting harm reduction strategies. From the qualitative data three negative consequences of use were identified, the most common of which was 'psychological problems'. In support of the quantitative findings the likelihood of reporting psychological problems increased with lifetime exposure to ecstasy in both recruitment conditions but interestingly this did not appear to impact on reasons for cessation of use. Participants also reported a number of effects that they regarded as beneficial. Future research should also take these aspects of use into account. \u00a9 2006 British Association for Psychopharmacology."}

Available antidepressants often fail to provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI) in acutely suicidal patients with MDD and there are currently no approved treatments for this population. In 2016, esketamine (ESK) was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for MDD patients at imminent risk for suicide based on data suggesting rapid reduction in depressive symptoms, including SI observed at 4 hours after an initial dose of ESK nasal spray in a phase 2 study [2]. The efficacy and safety of ESK nasal spray is being further evaluated in ASPIRE\u20102, one of two phase 3 studies in the first global registration program in an understudied population of MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: ASPIRE\u20102 (NCT03097133) is an ongoing double\u2010blind (DB), randomised, placebo\u2010controlled study being conducted in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the United States. Adult patients (18 to 64 years) with MDD (DSM\u20105 criteria, confirmed by Mini\u2010International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), with active SI and intent and in need of psychiatric hospitalisation were eligible. All patients received optimized standard\u2010of\u2010care (SoC hospitalisation and initiation/optimisation of antidepressant treatment). Patients were randomised (1:1) to ESK (84 mg) or placebo nasal spray twice\u2010weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to SoC. Change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 24 hours after first dose in Montgomery\u2010\u01fasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary endpoint) and Clinical Global Impression \u2013 Severity of Suicidality \u2013 Revised (CGI\u2010SS\u2010R) from the Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Assessment Tool (SIBAT) were assessed for efficacy. Treatment\u2010emergent adverse events (TEAEs), potential suicidal events from the SIBAT and dissociative effects (Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS]) were monitored for safety. Results: In total, 230 patients have been randomised to ESK+SoC or placebo+SoC; 184 (80%) patients completed the DB treatment (Table 1). Conclusions: MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent represent a vulnerable group in need of rapid treatment of their symptoms. ASPIRE\u20102, along with ASPIRE\u20101, comprise a novel program that focuses on addressing depressive symptoms including SI in MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide who are typically excluded from clinical studies of antidepressants.

Evidence from a longitudinal community-based cohort of marginalised women in a Canadian setting", "text": "Objective This study aimed to longitudinally investigate whether ever having used a psychedelic drug can have a protective effect on incidence of suicidality among marginalised women. Design Longitudinal community-based cohort study. Setting Data were drawn from a prospective, community-based cohort of marginalised women in Metro Vancouver, Canada. Participants 766 women completed the baseline questionnaire between January 2010 and August 2014. Participants who did not report suicidality at baseline and who completed at least one follow-up visit were included. Main outcome measure Extended Cox regression was used to model predictors of new suicidality (suicide ideation or attempts) over 54-month follow-up. Results Nearly half (46%; n=355) of participants reported prior suicidality and were thus excluded from the present analyses. Of 290 women eligible at baseline, 11% (n=31) reported recent suicidality during follow-up, with an incidence density of 4.42 per 100 person-years (95% CI 3.10 to 6.30). In multivariable analysis, reported lifetime psychedelic drug use was associated with a 60% reduced hazard for suicidality (adjusted HR (AHR) 0.40; 95% CI 0.17 to 0.94). Crystal methamphetamine use (AHR 3.25; 95% CI 1.47 to 7.21) and childhood abuse (AHR 3.54; 95% CI 1.49 to 8.40) remained independent predictors of suicidality. Conclusion The high rate of suicidality identified in this study is of major concern. Alongside emerging evidence on the potential of psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat some mental illness and addiction issues, our findings demonstrate that naturalistic psychedelic drug use is independently associated with reduced suicidality, while other illicit drug use and childhood trauma predispose women to suicidality. While observational, this study supports calls for further investigation of the therapeutic utility of psychedelic drugs in treating poor mental health and promoting mental wellness."}

Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives.

Patients presenting between 1990 and 1992 with psychiatric symptoms which developed in the context of MDMA use (n = 13) were interviewed, and their psychiatric, medical and drug history, sociodemographic background and mental state were examined in detail. The psychopathology of cases with psychosis (n = 8) was assessed with the Present State Examination and compared with that of substance-naive psychotic controls (n = 40). Results. Eight patients presented with psychotic syndromes, two experienced visual illusions, hallucinations and palinopsia, one had panic attacks, one suffered from depression, and one described chronic depersonalisation and derealisation. The psychopathology of the patients with psychoses was very similar to that of controls. Conclusions. Use of MDMA may be associated with a broader spectrum of psychiatric morbidity than heretofore suspected. Cases with psychosis may be clinically similar to psychotic patients with no history of substance use."}

In a WWW study of 763 unpaid volunteers, 481 had never taken Ecstasy, whereas 282 reported they had taken it. The Ecstasy users comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate Ecstasy users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy Ecstasy users (+100 occasions). Each participant also reported their experience with a range of other psychoactive drugs. The Ecstasy users reported significantly greater psychoactive drug usage than the non-Ecstasy users. The novice, moderate, and heavy Ecstasy users also differed significantly from each other in the use of cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms, but not of alcohol, cannabis, or cigarettes/nicotine. Experienced Ecstasy users also took significantly more MDMA tablets on each occasion, and reported a higher maximum weekly intake.

Though numerous routes of administration have been studied, subcutaneous (SC) has proven to be a convenient and cost-effective route making its use particularly relevant in developing countries. Here we provide a systematic review covering the use of SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression, including its efficacy, safety and tolerability. Methods: A systematic literature search was carried out, from inception through March, 2021, using PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE and Web of Science, with no limits of language. After identifying 159 potentially relevant articles, 12 articles were selected after applying our inclusion/exclusion criteria. These comprised two randomized clinical trials, five case-reports and five retrospective studies. Given the small number of studies found and their heterogeneous nature, a meta-analysis was not considered appropriate. Here we provide a synthesis of these data including participant characteristics, dose range, efficacy, safety/ tolerability. Risk of bias was accessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. Results: SC Ketamine was administered to unipolar and bipolar patients a single or multiple doses, weekly or twice-weekly, a dose-titration approach was made in major studies, dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg/Kg of racemic ketamine and 0.5\u20131 mg/Kg of esketamine. Across all studies, SC ketamine showed a rapid and robust antidepressant effect, with response/ remission rates from 50 to 100% following both single or multiple doses, with transitory side effects. Conclusion: SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression is a promising strategy showing beneficial efficacy and tolerability. Future studies exploring the SC route, its cost-effectiveness, and a direct comparison with IV and intranasal (IN) protocols are warranted.

Very few serotonergic hallucinogens have been studied in humans in decades, despite widespread use of these drugs and potential relevance of their mechanisms to hallucinations occurring in psychiatric and neurological disorders. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the mechanisms of hallucinogen-induced visions by measuring the visual and perceptual effects of the hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2AR receptor agonist and monoamine releaser, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. We found that MDA increased self-report measures of mystical-type experience and other hallucinogen-like effects, including reported visual alterations. MDA produced a significant increase in closed-eye visions (CEVs), with considerable individual variation. Magnitude of CEVs after MDA was associated with lower performance on measures of contour integration and object recognition.

Using the Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) framework, as proposed by the National Institute of Mental Health, we aim to synthesize the existing literature concerning the impact of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on the RDoC's Positive Valence Systems (PVS) domain, and to identify potential avenues for further research. METHODS: Two LSD-related terms (lysergic acid diethylamide and LSD) and 13 PVS-related terms (reward, happiness, bliss, motivation, reinforcement learning, operant, conditioning, satisfaction, decision making, habit, valence, affect, mood) were used to search electronic databases such as PubMed, Scopus, PsychINFO, and Web of Science for relevant articles. A manual search of the reference list resulted in nine additional articles. After screening, articles and data were evaluated and included based on their relevance to the objective of investigating the effects of LSD on the PVS. Articles and data were excluded if they did not provide information about the PVS, were observational in nature, lacked comparators or reference groups, or were duplicates. A risk of bias assessment was performed using the National Toxicology Program's Office of Health Assessment and Translation (NTP OHAT) risk of bias (RoB) tool. Data from the included articles were collected and structured based on the RDoC bio-behavioral matrix, specifically focusing on the PVS domain and its three constituent constructs: reward responsiveness, reward learning, and reward valuation. RESULTS: We reviewed 28 clinical studies with 477 participants. Lysergic acid diethylamide, assessed at self-report (23 studies), molecular (5 studies), circuit (4 studies), and paradigm (3 studies) levels, exhibited dose-dependent mood improvement (20 short-term and 3 long-term studies). The subjective and neural effects of LSD were linked to the 5-HT(2A) receptor (molecular). Animal studies (14 studies) suggested LSD could mildly reinforce conditioned place preference without aversion and reduce responsiveness to other rewards. Findings on reward learning were inconsistent but hinted at potential associative learning enhancements. Reward valuation measures indicated potential reductions in effort expenditure for other reinforcers. CONCLUSION: Our findings are consistent with our previous work, which indicated classical psychedelics, primarily serotonin 2A receptor agonists, enhanced reward responsiveness in healthy individuals and patient populations. Lysergic acid diethylamide exhibits a unique profile in the reward learning and valuation constructs. Using the RDoC-based framework, we identified areas for future research, enhancing our understanding of the impact of LSD on reward processing. However, applying RDoC to psychedelic research faces limitations due to diverse study designs that were not initially RDoC-oriented. Limitations include subjective outcome measure selection aligned with RDoC constructs and potential bias in synthesizing varied studies. Additionally, some human studies were open-label, introducing potential bias compared to randomized, blinded studies."}

Toxicokinetic data were gathered by analysis of blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat wipes collected during the first 5h after administration. Resultant plasma concentrations varied from 21 to 295 ng/ml, with an average peak concentration of 178 ng/ml observed between 2 and 4h after administration. MDA concentrations never exceeded 20 ng/ml. Corresponding MDMA concentrations in oral fluid, as measured with a specific LC-MS/MS method (which required only 50 microl of oral fluid), generally exceeded those in plasma and peaked at an average concentration of 1215 ng/ml. A substantial intra- and inter-subject variability was observed with this matrix, and values ranged from 50 to 6982 ng/ml MDMA. Somewhat surprisingly, even 4-5h after ingestion, the MDMA levels in sweat only averaged 25 ng/wipe. In addition to this controlled study, data were collected from 19 MDMA-users who participated in a driving simulator study (Study 2), comparing sober non-drug conditions with MDMA-only and multiple drug use conditions. In this particular study, urine samples were used for general drug screening and oral fluid was collected as an alternative to blood sampling. Analysis of oral fluid samples by LC-MS/MS revealed an average MDMA/MDEA concentration of 1121 ng/ml in the MDMA-only condition, with large inter-subject variability. This was also the case in the multiple drug condition, where generally, significantly higher concentrations of MDMA, MDEA and/or amphetamine were detected in the oral fluid samples. Urine screening revealed the presence of combinations such as MDMA, MDEA, amph, cannabis, cocaine, LSD and psilocine in the multiple-drug condition."}

LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11 hours. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. METHODS: We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14-hour sessions and received ketanserin (40 mg p.o.) or placebo 1 hour after LSD (100 \u00b5g p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors. Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD-assisted therapy.

Understanding their mechanisms can benefit from clinical experiments with related drugs. Yet the first known drug with such properties, 3,4-Methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), remains poorly studied and its pharmacokinetics in humans are unknown. We conducted a within-subjects, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 1.4 mg/kg oral racemic MDA and compared results to those from our prior similar studies with 1.5 mg/kg oral racemic MDMA. MDA was well-tolerated by participants. MDA induced robust increases in heart rate and blood pressure and increased cortisol and prolactin to a similar degree as MDMA. MDA self-report effects shared features with MDMA as well as with classical psychedelics. MDA self-report effects lasted longer than those of MDMA, with MDA effects remaining elevated at 8 h while MDMA effects resolved by 6 h. Cmax and AUC(0-\u221e) for MDA were 229 \u00b1 39 (mean \u00b1 SD) and 3636 \u00b1 958 \u00b5g/L for MDA and 92 \u00b1 61 and 1544 \u00b1 741 \u00b5g/L for the metabolite 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA). There was considerable between-subject variation in MDA/HMA ratios. The similarity of MDA and MDMA pharmacokinetics suggests that the greater duration of MDA effects is due to pharmacodynamics rather than pharmacokinetics."}

Fifty patients who were candidate for undergoing ECT entered the study and were divided into two groups namely A and B. The group A received a package containing 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine and 1.5 mg/kg ketamine plus 0.1 mg/kg dexmedetomidine, and the group B received a medicine package containing 0.5 mg/kg succinylcholine and 1.5 mg/kg ketamine plus normal saline. The hemodynamic variables and side effects of the two drug classes were evaluated and compared to each other. Results: The durations of spontaneous respiratory recovery from seizure termination, end seizure to complete consciousness and recovery in the group A was significantly lower than the group B (P<0.001). However, the mean of systolic blood pressure and mean arterial blood pressure after the end of seizure was significantly less in the group A than the group B, but the mean of SPO2 in the fifth minute in the group B was significantly lower than the group A. However, the frequency of nausea and muscle pain in the group B was significantly higher than the group A. Conclusion: The addition of dexmedetomidine to ketamine in the candidate patients for ECT can shorten the duration of seizure, recovery time, respiratory depression, and also reduce complications such as nausea, muscle pain and oxygen depletion."}

OBJECTIVES: The present study aimed to be the largest to date in sample size and 5HT-related behaviors; the first to compare present ecstasy users with past users after an abstinence of 4 or more years, and the first to include robust controls for other recreational substances. METHODS: A sample of 997 participants (52 % male) was recruited to four control groups (non-drug (ND), alcohol/nicotine (AN), cannabis/alcohol/nicotine (CAN), non-ecstasy polydrug (PD)), and two ecstasy polydrug groups (present (MDMA) and past users (EX-MDMA). Participants completed a drug history questionnaire, Beck Depression Inventory, Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and Wechsler Memory Scale-Revised which, in total, provided 13 psychometric measures. RESULTS: While the CAN and PD groups tended to record greater deficits than the non-drug controls, the MDMA and EX-MDMA groups recorded greater deficits than all the control groups on ten of the 13 psychometric measures. Strikingly, despite prolonged abstinence (mean, 4.98; range, 4-9 years), past ecstasy users showed few signs of recovery. Compared with present ecstasy users, the past users showed no change for ten measures, increased impairment for two measures, and improvement on just one measure. CONCLUSIONS: Given this record of impaired memory and clinically significant levels of depression, impulsiveness, and sleep disturbance, the prognosis for the current generation of ecstasy users is a major cause for concern."}

Intriguingly, double-blind controlled studies have shown that the classic hallucinogen psilocybin occasions personally and spiritually significant mystical experiences that predict long-term changes in behaviors, attitudes and values. In the present report we assessed the effect of psilocybin on changes in the five broad domains of personality - Neuroticism, Extroversion, Openness, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness. Consistent with participant claims of hallucinogen-occasioned increases in aesthetic appreciation, imagination, and creativity, we found significant increases in Openness following a high-dose psilocybin session. In participants who had mystical experiences during their psilocybin session, Openness remained significantly higher than baseline more than 1 year after the session. The findings suggest a specific role for psilocybin and mystical-type experiences in adult personality change."}

Subjects received 20 mg/day paroxetine (or placebo) for the 3 days before MDMA challenge (100 mg). Acute MDMA administration produced a time-dependent decrease in CD4 T-helper cells, a decrease in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation, a simultaneous increase in natural killer (NK) cells as well as cortisol and prolactin stimulation kinetics. A high increase in the release of anti-inflammatory cytokines (transforming growth factor-beta and interleukin-10) with a simultaneous decrease of anti-inflammatory response (interleukin-2) was also observed. Pretreatment with paroxetine partially reduced MDMA effects on CD4 T and NK cells, whereas totally inhibiting the suppression of the immune response to mitogens and alterations in cytokines release. MDMA-induced alterations in the immune system as well as antagonistic effects mediated by paroxetine show a trend toward baseline levels at 24 h. These findings suggest that acute effects of MDMA on immune system are mainly mediated by its interaction with the serotonin transporter and subsequent serotonin release with a possible participation of other neuroendocrine regulatory systems."}

Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2010Self Rated (QIDS\u2010SR16) total score (exploratory efficacy endpoint) showed similar results. Objectives: To analyse changes in specific depression symptoms after psilocybin treatment in the aforementioned study, as measured by individual item scores on the MADRS and QIDS\u2010SR16 (range 0\u20106 and 0\u20103). Methods: Participants with TRD were randomised to single doses of psilocybin 25mg (n=79), 10mg (n=75), or 1mg (n=79). A remote, blinded rater assessed the MADRS at Baseline, Day 2 (the day post\u2010psilocybin), and Weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The QIDS\u2010SR16 was self\u2010rated at Baseline, Day 1, Day 2, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each time point, descriptive statistics were calculated for each MADRS and QIDS\u2010SR16 individual item score. Results: At Week 3, MADRS items with the largest differences in mean CFB in the 25mg arm were Inability to Feel, Apparent Sadness, Lassitude, and Reported Sadness. Greater improvement in the 25mg arm was apparent from Day 2 and remained to Week 12 (Lassitude remained to Week 6 only). On the QIDS\u2010SR16, the item with the largest difference in mean CFB at Week 3 in the 25mg arm was in Feeling Sad and remained evident to Week 12 (Table 1). Conclusions: A single administration of COMP360 psilocybin therapy rapidly and dose\u2010relatedly improved symptoms of depressed mood and anhedonia \u2010 the two key symptoms of depression. As anhedonia is predictive of poorer treatment response, and improvements in anhedonia correlate with improvements in functioning, it is important to understand the impact of treatments on this symptom."}

Methods: Twenty-two participants (13 males, 9 females) wore a wrist actigraph/data recorder to record real-time drug use and ecstasy craving for 6 weeks. Rates of alcohol and drug use on ecstasy use versus non-use nights, and before, during, and after ecstasy use were analyzed with generalized estimation equations (GEE). Craving was modeled with GEE and linear mixed models. Results: Approximately 70% of ecstasy uses occurred on Friday or Saturday nights. No drug was significantly more likely to be used on ecstasy use nights than comparison Friday and Saturday nights. On nights ecstasy was used, in general across all drugs assessed, use was more likely before and during than after ecstasy intoxication, while alcohol use was also more likely before than during ecstasy intoxication. Though low overall, craving for ecstasy increased over 24 h before use and was higher on Friday nights of weeks ecstasy was used on weekends than weeks it was not used. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy on a particular night may not be associated with any greater likelihood of using any other intoxicating drug, and use of other drugs on nights involving ecstasy use may simply reflect a \"natural history\" of drug-use nights that begins with alcohol, progresses to more intoxicating drugs, and ends with little drug use. Confirmation of these findings awaits further advances in the application of ecological momentary assessment methodologies. \u00a9 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."}

While verbally unresponsive, he refused to open his eyes, demonstrated waxy flexibility of his arms, but the balance of his physical, neurological, and laboratory exams were normal. Strongly suspecting a catatonic state, they needed to rapidly confirm that diagnosis or begin evaluating him for potentially life-threatening non-psychiatric illnesses. Lacking other diagnostic modalities, they administered low-dose ketamine boluses. Ketamine 25 mg (1 mL) was diluted in 9 mL NS (2.5 mg/mL). Based on similar protocols, 1 mL of the solution (0.03 mg/Kg) was given intravenously every few minutes. After 12.5 mg ketamine, he was conscious and verbal. Subsequent history confirmed a prior episode requiring an extensive, non-productive medical evaluation. Psychiatry later confirmed the diagnosis. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Patients with catatonia-like states pose a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Multiple interventions have been used with varying success. Optimal interventions provide a rapid resolution (or demonstrate that a psychiatric cause is not likely), be safe, encompass few contraindications, and be familiar to the clinician. In our patient, subanesthetic doses of ketamine fulfilled these criteria and successfully resolved the condition. If shown effective in other cases, ketamine would be a valuable addition to our psychiatric armamentarium."}

Ketamine exerts neuroprotective effects after cerebral ischemia by anti-excitotoxic and anti-inflammatory mechanisms. We hypothesized that ketamine attenuates POCD in patients undergoing cardiac surgery concomitant with an anti-inflammatory effect. METHODS: Patients randomly received placebo (0.9% saline; n=26) or an i.v. bolus of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg; n=26) during anesthetic induction. Anesthesia was maintained with isoflurane and fentanyl. A nonsurgical group (n=26) was also included as control. Recent verbal and nonverbal memory and executive functions were assessed before and 1 week after surgery or a 1-week waiting period for the nonsurgical controls. Serum C-reactive protein (CRP) concentrations were determined before surgery and on the first post-operative day. RESULTS: Baseline neurocognitive and depression scores were similar in the placebo, ketamine, and nonsurgical control groups. Cognitive performance after surgery decreased by at least 2 SDs (z-score of 1.96) in 21 patients in the placebo group and only in seven patients in the ketamine group compared with the nonsurgical controls (P<0.001, Fisher's exact test). Cognitive performance was also significantly different between the placebo- and the ketamine-treated groups based on all z-scores (P<0.001, Mann-Whitney U-test). Pre-operative CRP concentrations were similar (P<0.33, Mann-Whitney U-test) in the placebo- and ketamine-treated groups. The post-operative CRP concentration was significantly (P<0.01, Mann-Whitney U-test) lower in the ketamine-treated than in the placebo-treated group. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine attenuates POCD 1 week after cardiac surgery and this effect may be related to the anti-inflammatory action of the drug."}

This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies."}
