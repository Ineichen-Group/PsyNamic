Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used.

We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses).

Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available.

Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year.

Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms.

Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.", "doi": "10.3310/hta13050", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19195429/", "secondary_title": "Health Technol Assess", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4‐6 hours post‐infusion, subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose (100‐200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre‐randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post‐infusion, 32 patients were non‐responders, and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect. In non‐responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop‐outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders.

These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects.

METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years.

Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, had experience with microdosing and were diagnosed with at least one mental or physiological disorder by a medical doctor or therapist (N = 410; 7.2%) were included in the analyses.

METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy human volunteers received a moderate dose of psilocybin, while high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The current source density and the lagged phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions were computed and correlated with psilocybin-induced altered states of consciousness. RESULTS: Psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations at 1.5-20 Hz within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions.

Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with demonstrated antidepressant effects in the adult population, however, the efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of pediatric depression remains poorly understood. Electronic databases were searched from inception to June 2022 to identify relevant articles. Six articles involving 46 participants with a mean age of 15.7 years were included in this systematic review. Out of six articles, three were case reports, one was a randomized clinical trial (RCT) and two were open-label trials. All studies used 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine except for one, which used 2-7 micrograms/kg. Ketamine was significantly associated with reduced depressive symptoms without severe adverse events. Taken together, the results of these studies demonstrated the potential role of ketamine for treating pediatric depression.

Ketamine is known to have psychomimetic (including hallucinogenic), urological, and hepatic adverse effects. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for refractory cancer pain in adults. SEARCH METHODS: For this update, we searched MEDLINE (OVID) to December 2016. We searched CENTRAL (CRSO), Embase (OVID) and two clinical trial registries to January 2017. SELECTION CRITERIA: The intervention considered by this review was the addition of ketamine, given by any route of administration, in any dose, to pre-existing opioid treatment given by any route and in any dose, compared with placebo or active control. We included studies with a group size of at least 10 participants who completed the trial. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two review authors independently assessed the search results and performed 'Risk of bias' assessments. We aimed to extract data on patient-reported pain intensity, total opioid consumption over the study period; use of rescue medication; adverse events; measures of patient satisfaction/preference; function; and distress. We also assessed participant withdrawal (dropout) from trial. We assessed the quality of the evidence using GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation). MAIN RESULTS: One new study (185 participants) was identified by the updated search and included in the review. We included a total of three studies in this update.Two small studies, both with cross-over design, with 20 and 10 participants respectively, were eligible for inclusion in the original review. One study with 20 participants examined the addition of intrathecal ketamine to intrathecal morphine, compared with intrathecal morphine alone. The second study with 10 participants examined the addition of intravenous ketamine bolus in two different doses to ongoing morphine therapy, compared with placebo. Both of these studies reported reduction in pain intensity and reduction in morphine requirements when ketamine was added to opioid for refractory cancer pain. The new study identified by the updated search had a parallel group design and 185 participants. This placebo-controlled study examined rapid titration of subcutaneous ketamine to high dose (500 mg) in participants who were using different opioids. There were no differences between groups for patient-reported pain intensity.Pooling of the data from the three included trials was not appropriate because of clinical heterogeneity.The study examining intrathecal drug administration reported no adverse events related to ketamine. In the study using intravenous bolus administration, ketamine caused hallucinations in four of 10 participants. In the rapid dose escalation/high-dose subcutaneous ketamine study, there was almost twice the incidence of adverse events in the ketamine group, compared to the placebo group, with the most common adverse events being needle site irritation and cognitive disturbance. Two serious adverse events (bradyarrhythmia and cardiac arrest) thought to be related to ketamine were also reported in this trial.For all three studies there was an unclear risk of bias overall.

In one session you will be given a placebo and in the other you will get the active medication, but no one will know which drug is administered when. This is called a double blind study. You will be asked to fill out questionnaires about how you feel, your pain levels and your moods. There will also be at least two psychotherapy meetings before the study sessions, so that you are fully aware of what to expect and to have all your questions answered. We cannot take you in the study if you have central nervous system (CNS) cancers, kidney disease, diabetes, abnormal liver function tests, epilepsy, cardiovascular disease including untreated high blood pressure (BP greater than 140/90), and pregnancy. The psychiatric exclusions are: you or an immediate family member with a history of a major psychiatric disorder, a current substance abuse problem, or an anxiety or a mood disorder within 1 year prior to the onset of symptoms of your current illness. We also cannot take you in the study if you are taking certain medications, such as: anti‐seizure, insulin and oral hypoglycemics, and cardiovascular drugs (except anti‐hypertensive medications). Some antidepressant (SSRIs) medications cannot be taken within the two weeks prior to the session (except for Prozac, which cannot be taken in the last 5 weeks prior to the session). You will get a MRI of the brain prior to admission (if you haven't had one in the prior two months), at the study's expense, to be sure there is no CNS involvement. You can provide us, or the study will pay for, lab work from the prior 2 weeks (CBC, liver function and renal function). The history and physical, neurological exam, EKG, and a urine pregnancy test (if you are a woman with child‐bearing potential), will be done on admission by the house staff doctors. You will be allowed to take your own medications while in the hospital, and will be encouraged to bring to the hospital personal photos, small memorabilia, and some of your favorite music that can be played during the sessions.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00302744", "annotation": "Substance(s)"}

METHODS: This phase 3, double-blind, multicenter study (ASPIRE I), conducted between June 2017 and December 2018, enrolled 226 adults having major depressive disorder based on Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders fifth edition (DSM-5) criteria, active suicidal ideation with intent, and need for psychiatric hospitalization. Patients were randomized 1:1 to esketamine 84 mg or placebo nasal spray twice-weekly for 4 weeks, each with comprehensive standard-of-care treatment (initial psychiatric hospitalization and newly initiated or optimized oral antidepressant[s] therapy).

The objective of this study was to determine if NO signaling plays a primary role in ketamine’s mechanism of action. We investigated the effect of the co‐administration of sodium nitroprusside (SNP), a NO donor, compared to placebo (PBO), on the antidepressant and dissociative effects of ketamine in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD). Methods: 26 eligible participants underwent a single‐blind infusion of ketamine co‐administered with PBO to identify ketamine responders.

Of the 20 responders, 16 were randomized to a double‐blind infusion of ketamine (0.5mg/kg) co‐administered with PBO (N=7) or SNP (0.5μg/kg/min) (N=9).

Lapidus et al. reported that intranasal ketamine was tolerable and effective in major depression. Thus, we hypothesized that intranasal ketamine administration in OCD patients would be similarly tolerated and yield a greater proportion of treatment responders than midazolam at 1 week post‐administration. Methods: With IRB approval, OCD outpatients (aged 18‐55) were recruited (September 2014 to May 2015). Eligible patients met criteria for OCD (both DSM‐IV and DSM‐5), were at least moderately symptomatic (Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale [Y‐BOCS (6, 7)] score≥ 16), and on stable psychotropic medication doses for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [17 item; HDRS(8)>25) or comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that made participation unsafe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intranasal ketamine 50 mg or intranasal midazolam 4 mg. Ketamine was delivered using the administration protocol of a prior intranasal ketamine study in depression. An independent evaluator, blind to treatment, evaluated OCD and depression symptoms at baseline and one week after drug administration. Treatment response was defined a priori as ≥ 35% Y‐BOCS score reduction. Patients randomized to midazolam were offered open‐label intranasal ketamine 50 mg after study completion. Results: Of the 23 adults with OCD who contacted the clinic to participate in pharmacological studies, 20 (87%) were screened and determined eligible for study participation. Of those 20 adults, 15 (75%) refused study participation due to not wanting intranasal medication, 6 (40%) of whom endorsed fear of contamination from the nasal applicator. After two participants completed the study, we discontinued it due to poor tolerability and low enrollment rate as detailed below. Subject #1 was a 36‐year‐old African‐American male with moderate OCD without depression (YBOCS = 21; HDRS = 1), and taking no medications at baseline. He was randomized to 50mg intranasal ketamine. Upon administration, he showed visible signs of discomfort (e.g., wrinkled nose, upper lip retraction, recoiling), stating “this is very unpleasant in my nose ‐ isn't there another way for me to get this?” but wanted to continue the study. Side effects included dissociation (e.g., body feeling unusually large, colors seemed brighter than expected, and time slowed) that lasted for 45 min after administration. One week after administration, he did not meet treatment response criteria (YBOCS = 19; HDRS = 0). Subject #2 was a 20‐year‐old Caucasian female (on stable dose of sertraline 125 mg daily for OCD and divalproate 250 mg daily for migraines) with severe OCD and moderate depression (YBOCS = 33 and HDRS = 18). She was randomized to midazolam 4 mg. She wrinkled her nose and complained of an unpleasant “bitter taste” and “stinging” in the nose; but wanted to continue the study. She reported lightheadedness and perceptual changes (i.e., sensation of having shrunk) 30 min after administration, which resolved by 60 min after administration; she also reported headache that resolved by 180 min after administration. One week post midazolam administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, but her depressive symptoms improved from moderate to mild (YBOCS =35; HDRS = 10). She was offered and accepted open treatment with intranasal ketamine. Upon administration she frowned, wrinkled her nose, opened her mouth with tongue extension and complained of unpleasant taste, stating, “I would much prefer this in my vein than in my nose.” She also reported nausea and headache that resolved 110 minutes postadministration. One week after keta ine administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, though her depressive symptom severity met criteria for remission (YBOCS = 32, HDRS =2). Conclusions: Contrary to our hypotheses, 1) nasal delivery was poorly tolerated in the first two study participants, and 2) neither patient met OCD response criteria one week after ketamine administration. As a result of observed verbal and physical cues of patient's discomfort during nasal delivery and difficulty enrolling study participants, the study was discontinued. The discomfort reactions to intranasal ketamine were specific to the insertion of the nasal applicator and the spray method of delivery, rather than to medication side effects. In contrast, in prior studies of ketamine conducted by C.I.R., placement of the IV and ketamine administration were well tolerated. Enrollment rates for this study were very low (of the 20 screened eligible participants, only 2 [10%] agreed to participate over 9 months), compared to significantly higher rates in C.I.R.'s studies in the same clinic with IV ketamine. Regarding our finding that neither patient met OCD treatment response criteria, our results may simply reflect subgroups of OCD patients that do and do not respond to ketamine (as indicated by contrasting prior publications on the efficacy of IV ketamine in OCD).

Lapidus et al. reported that intranasal ketamine was tolerable and effective in major depression. Thus, we hypothesized that intranasal ketamine administration in OCD patients would be similarly tolerated and yield a greater proportion of treatment responders than midazolam at 1 week post‐administration. Methods: With IRB approval, OCD outpatients (aged 18‐55) were recruited (September 2014 to May 2015). Eligible patients met criteria for OCD (both DSM‐IV and DSM‐5), were at least moderately symptomatic (Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale [Y‐BOCS (6, 7)] score≥ 16), and on stable psychotropic medication doses for at least 6 weeks prior to enrollment. Exclusion criteria included severe depression (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [17 item; HDRS(8)>25) or comorbid psychiatric or medical conditions that made participation unsafe. Patients were randomized 1:1 to receive intranasal ketamine 50 mg or intranasal midazolam 4 mg. Ketamine was delivered using the administration protocol of a prior intranasal ketamine study in depression. An independent evaluator, blind to treatment, evaluated OCD and depression symptoms at baseline and one week after drug administration. Treatment response was defined a priori as ≥ 35% Y‐BOCS score reduction. Patients randomized to midazolam were offered open‐label intranasal ketamine 50 mg after study completion. Results: Of the 23 adults with OCD who contacted the clinic to participate in pharmacological studies, 20 (87%) were screened and determined eligible for study participation. Of those 20 adults, 15 (75%) refused study participation due to not wanting intranasal medication, 6 (40%) of whom endorsed fear of contamination from the nasal applicator. After two participants completed the study, we discontinued it due to poor tolerability and low enrollment rate as detailed below. Subject #1 was a 36‐year‐old African‐American male with moderate OCD without depression (YBOCS = 21; HDRS = 1), and taking no medications at baseline. He was randomized to 50mg intranasal ketamine. Upon administration, he showed visible signs of discomfort (e.g., wrinkled nose, upper lip retraction, recoiling), stating “this is very unpleasant in my nose ‐ isn't there another way for me to get this?” but wanted to continue the study. Side effects included dissociation (e.g., body feeling unusually large, colors seemed brighter than expected, and time slowed) that lasted for 45 min after administration. One week after administration, he did not meet treatment response criteria (YBOCS = 19; HDRS = 0). Subject #2 was a 20‐year‐old Caucasian female (on stable dose of sertraline 125 mg daily for OCD and divalproate 250 mg daily for migraines) with severe OCD and moderate depression (YBOCS = 33 and HDRS = 18). She was randomized to midazolam 4 mg. She wrinkled her nose and complained of an unpleasant “bitter taste” and “stinging” in the nose; but wanted to continue the study. She reported lightheadedness and perceptual changes (i.e., sensation of having shrunk) 30 min after administration, which resolved by 60 min after administration; she also reported headache that resolved by 180 min after administration. One week post midazolam administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, but her depressive symptoms improved from moderate to mild (YBOCS =35; HDRS = 10). She was offered and accepted open treatment with intranasal ketamine. Upon administration she frowned, wrinkled her nose, opened her mouth with tongue extension and complained of unpleasant taste, stating, “I would much prefer this in my vein than in my nose.” She also reported nausea and headache that resolved 110 minutes postadministration. One week after keta ine administration, she did not meet OCD response criteria, though her depressive symptom severity met criteria for remission (YBOCS = 32, HDRS =2). Conclusions: Contrary to our hypotheses, 1) nasal delivery was poorly tolerated in the first two study participants, and 2) neither patient met OCD response criteria one week after ketamine administration. As a result of observed verbal and physical cues of patient's discomfort during nasal delivery and difficulty enrolling study participants, the study was discontinued. The discomfort reactions to intranasal ketamine were specific to the insertion of the nasal applicator and the spray method of delivery, rather than to medication side effects. In contrast, in prior studies of ketamine conducted by C.I.R., placement of the IV and ketamine administration were well tolerated. Enrollment rates for this study were very low (of the 20 screened eligible participants, only 2 [10%] agreed to participate over 9 months), compared to significantly higher rates in C.I.R.'s studies in the same clinic with IV ketamine. Regarding our finding that neither patient met OCD treatment response criteria, our results may simply reflect subgroups of OCD patients that do and do not respond to ketamine (as indicated by contrasting prior publications on the efficacy of IV ketamine in OCD). By chance, the study participants (n = 2) may be in the subgroup that does not respond to ketamine.

Those in the Psilocybin condition will receive .36 mg/kg of psilocybin. Based on previous research, .36 mg/kg of psilocybin is expected to balance the intention to increase the probability of having a full mystical‐type experience against the odds of having a subjectively challenging psychological experience. Those in the Active Placebo condition will receive 2.6 mg/kg of dextromethorphan (DXM). DXM was selected as the placebo drug in the current study because its subjective and behavioral effects at higher doses can resemble those of classical hallucinogens. Participants will be blinded to what drug they are administered. Participants will be unblinded at the end of the study. Interested individuals who call research staff will undergo an initial telephone prescreen by a trained member of the research staff: the study aims, protocol, and any possible risks will be described and a series of questions will be asked to determine interest and eligibility for screening for the study. Initial eligibility may also be assessed via an online questionnaire through Qualtrics. Qualified participants will be scheduled for an in‐person screening. In‐person screening sessions will be conducted by the PI or trained research staff. Individuals will first undergo informed consent; the consent form will describe the necessary eligibility confirmation that takes place before proceeding with the full study. A physical examination, a detailed psychiatric interview, several self‐report questionnaires, and a detailed medical history will be completed at the screening session, which takes place at the UAB Clinical Research Unit. Participants will also have their blood drawn for screening tests. Study staff will provide participants with a hand‐held tablet device and instructions on how to complete the daily symptom questionnaire via the tablet. They will be asked to begin reporting daily symptoms on their tablet from home that evening. Eligible participants will be contacted by study staff by phone to inform them of their eligibility. All participants will undergo at least 2 weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours each, with the possibility of 1‐2 additional weekly preparatory sessions per the discretion of the investigator. These sessions are to educate participants on the study protocol, psilocybin administration, and study treatment rationale. Participants will be randomly assigned in a double‐blind manner to the Psilocybin or Active Placebo group following their final preparation session. One week after the final preparation session, participants will be instructed to eat a low‐fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration session at 8:00 am, approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be collected to verify drug‐free and non‐pregnant status and participants will be encouraged to relax and reflect before drug administration. The drug administration session will take place over the course of 8 hours.

Current treatments do not fully address cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). Several lines of evidence indicate that N‐methy‐ D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia, and specifically to CIAS. One strategy to ameliorate NMDAR hypofunction is to stimulate alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐ methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPAR). AMPAR opening depolarizes neuronal membranes to relieve the Mg2+block of colocalized NMDAR, which increases NMDAR‐mediated Ca2+gating that ultimately generates changes in the synaptic morphology and function thought to underlie learning and memory. Consistent with these theories, the AMPAR positive allosteric modulator (“potentiator”) PF‐04958242 attenuates spatial working memory deficits induced by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine in a rat radial arm maze task and a nonhuman primate spatial delayed response task. The primary aim of the reported study was to assess whether PF‐04958242 attenuated ketamine‐induced impairment in verbal learning and memory in healthy human volunteers. Secondary aims included assessing if PF‐04958242 modulated ketamineinduced impairments in working memory and spatial working memory and the clinical symptoms associated with ketamine. Methods: Healthy male subjects (n=29) participated in this randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 2‐period, 2‐way crossover study. During each of the two periods in this study, subjects received a single oral loading dose of PF‐04958242 (0.35 mg) or placebo on Day 1. This was followed by a single daily dose of PF‐04958242 (0.25 mg) or placebo for 4 subsequent days (Day 2‐5).The effect of PF‐04958242 on ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment and associated subjective effects were assessed during a pharmacological challenge (racemic ketamine 0.23 mg/kg bolus over one min; and 0.58 mg/kg/hour for ∼ 70 min.) 1 hour after PF‐ 04958242 or placebo administration on Day 5. Subjects were housed on an inpatient unit from Day 0 (pre‐dose) to Day 6 (post‐ketamine challenge) of each test period. The two periods were separated by a 14‐day washout period. The cognitive battery consisted of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‐Revised (HVLT‐R) and tasks from the computerized test battery Cogstate. Ketamineinduced psychotomimetic effects were captured on a modified version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale (CADSS). The primary efficacy endpoint, mean score of immediate recall trials 2 and 3 in HVLT R on Day 5 (HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3), was analyzed in subjects completing both treatment periods (and without major protocol deviations) with a linear crossover model including period, sequence, and treatment as fixed factors, baseline score as a continuous covariate, and subject as a random effect. Baseline was defined as the last pre‐dose measurement taken on Day 1 for each period separately. Results: A total of 29 subjects were randomized and 22 completed the study. The mean age of subjects was 33.9±6.8 years. The PF‐04958242 plasma exposures were within the expected range for testing the study hypotheses. Ketamine treatment resulted in a mean impairment of 2.96 words on the HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3. Ketamine also induced transient psychotomimetic effects. Treatment with PF‐ 04958242 demonstrated a statistically significant attenuation of ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment, resulting in placebo‐adjusted mean reduction in ketamine‐induced impairment of 0.58 words on HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3 with a 2‐sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of (0.04, 1.12) words. In exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints, PF‐04958242 attenuated ketamine mediated impairment on the 2‐back and spatial working memory tasks, but not on the 1‐back task or one card learning task. There were no differences in PF‐04958242 vs. placebo on ketamine‐induced PANSS or CADSS scores Overall, PF‐04958242 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. The most common adverse events (AEs) attributed to PF‐04958242 were mild gastrointestinal disorders. Non‐treatment‐related AEs were consistent with the well‐known AE profile of ketamine and were observed evenly across PF‐04958242 and placebo groups. Conclusions: Treatment with PF‐04958242 for 5 days significantly attenuated the ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment in verbal learning and memory (HVLT‐R‐IR2‐ 3) in healthy volunteers, and resulted in similar effects on working memory tasks in exploratory analyses. These results suggest clinical translation of the findings with PF‐ 04958242 in rat and nonhuman primate models of ketamine‐mediated cognitive disruption.

Subjects were housed on an inpatient unit from Day 0 (pre‐dose) to Day 6 (post‐ketamine challenge) of each test period. The two periods were separated by a 14‐day washout period. The cognitive battery consisted of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‐Revised (HVLT‐R) and tasks from the computerized test battery Cogstate. Ketamineinduced psychotomimetic effects were captured on a modified version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale (CADSS). The primary efficacy endpoint, mean score of immediate recall trials 2 and 3 in HVLT R on Day 5 (HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3), was analyzed in subjects completing both treatment periods (and without major protocol deviations) with a linear crossover model including period, sequence, and treatment as fixed factors, baseline score as a continuous covariate, and subject as a random effect. Baseline was defined as the last pre‐dose measurement taken on Day 1 for each period separately. Results: A total of 29 subjects were randomized and 22 completed the study. The mean age of subjects was 33.9±6.8 years. The PF‐04958242 plasma exposures were within the expected range for testing the study hypotheses. Ketamine treatment resulted in a mean impairment of 2.96 words on the HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3. Ketamine also induced transient psychotomimetic effects. Treatment with PF‐ 04958242 demonstrated a statistically significant attenuation of ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment, resulting in placebo‐adjusted mean reduction in ketamine‐induced impairment of 0.58 words on HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3 with a 2‐sided 90% confidence interval (CI) of (0.04, 1.12) words. In exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints, PF‐04958242 attenuated ketamine mediated impairment on the 2‐back and spatial working memory tasks, but not on the 1‐back task or one card learning task. There were no differences in PF‐04958242 vs. placebo on ketamine‐induced PANSS or CADSS scores Overall, PF‐04958242 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. The most common adverse events (AEs) attributed to PF‐04958242 were mild gastrointestinal disorders. Non‐treatment‐related AEs were consistent with the well‐known AE profile of ketamine and were observed evenly across PF‐04958242 and placebo groups. Conclusions: Treatment with PF‐04958242 for 5 days significantly attenuated the ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment in verbal learning and memory (HVLT‐R‐IR2‐ 3) in healthy volunteers, and resulted in similar effects on working memory tasks in exploratory analyses. These results suggest clinical translation of the findings with PF‐ 04958242 in rat and nonhuman primate models of ketamine‐mediated cognitive disruption. PF‐04958242 was well tolerated, consistent with prior clinical studies, and did not appear to exhibit any consistent differences in its safety profile in combination with ketamine.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2014.281", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500146/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

We hypothesized that elevated baseline plasma Shank3 levels might predict antidepressant response to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with bipolar depression received a double-blind, randomized, subanesthetic dose (.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Of the patients for whom Shank3 levels were collected, 15 completed baseline 3-Tesla MRI and 17 completed post-ketamine [(18)F]-FDG PET. RESULTS: Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 (r=-.39, p=.047), 2 (r=-.45, p=.02), and 3 (r=-.42, p=.03) and were associated with larger average (r=.58, p=.02) and right amygdala volume (r=.65, p=.009).

However, the time-course of the antidepressive action of ketamine remained unclear. In the present meta-analysis, we provided a clear and objective view regarding the putative antidepressive effect of ketamine and its time-course. We searched the MEDLINE and PsycINFO databases through December 2013, without limits on year of publication, using the key words ketamine and synonyms for mood disorder or episode. Six randomized, double-blind and placebo-controlled trials of ketamine in major depression (n=103 patients) were thus identified. Authors were contacted and they all provided original data necessary for this meta-analysis. Standardized mean differences (SMD) were calculated between the depression scores in ketamine and placebo groups at days 1, 2, 3-4, 7 and 14.

They take weeks to produce full clinical effects, which suggest that the NMDA system may be involved in the pathophysiology of depression [1]. Ketamine, a non competitive antagonist acting at NMDA receptors, is reported to have a rapid onset of anti‐depressive effects [2,3,4]. Objective: To investigate the effect of intra‐operative sedation of S‐ketamine on indices of depression. Method: 80 patients aged 60 to 83 years of age, selected for surgery under epidural anesthesia, were classified as depressed (D) or non‐depressed (ND), according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM‐IV) criteria, and randomized into two sub‐groups D1, D2 and ND1, ND2. The sub‐groups D1 and ND1 received S‐ketamine and midazolam, while the groups D2 and ND2, received only midazolam. Sedation was titrated to achieve grade 3‐4 of the Ramsay Sedation Scale. Depression was assessed using the Hamilton Depression Rating (HDR) Scale of 21 items, applied preoperatively and postoperatively. Results: The mean HDR score decreased from the preoperative value of 18.8 Â ±6,3 to 12.7 Â ±4.5 on the second postoperative day in depressed patients who received S‐ketamine+midazolam (P Ë “ 0,0001). There were no significant differences between the non depressed groups. Discussion: Racemic ketamine have clinical effects similar to the classic antidepressants, but with a quicker onset and a lasting effect [2,3,4]. We demonstrated that S‐ketamine can improve depressed patients the same way. The modest doses of S‐ketamine and the epidural anesthesia may have accounted for the absence of hypertension in all groups. No arrhythmiaswere found. The use of midazolam lowered the incidence of psychotomimetic effects [5], decreased the cardiovascular stimulating effects of ketamine on the systemic and pulmonary circulation [6,7] and allowed intra‐operative sedation. Patients who suffer from depression appear to appreciate pain with greater acuity [8]. Actually, depressed patients felt more pain in the postoperative period than the nondepressed ones. Postoperative analgesic effects of S‐ketamine are still under discussion [9,10], but they could potentially have improved depression. However depressed patients (D1) had a significant amelioration in the severity of their depression despite no significant differences in pain scores, from D2 group.

Background: Novel interventions for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adolescents are urgently needed. Ketamine has been studied in adults with TRD, but little information is available for adolescents. This study investigated efficacy and tolerability of intravenous ketamine in adolescents with TRD, and explored clinical response predictors. Methods: Adolescents, 12–18 years of age, with TRD (failure to respond to two previous antidepressant trials) were administered six ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions over 2 weeks. Clinical response was defined as a 50% decrease in Children's Depression Rating Scale-Revised (CDRS-R); remission was CDRS-R score ≤ 28. Tolerability assessment included monitoring vital signs and dissociative symptoms using the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Results: Thirteen participants (mean age 16.9 years, range 14.5–18.8 years, eight biologically male) completed the protocol. Average decrease in CDRS-R was 42.5% (p = 0.0004). Five (38%) adolescents met criteria for clinical response. Three responders showed sustained remission at 6-week follow-up; relapse occurred within 2 weeks for the other two responders. Ketamine infusions were generally well tolerated; dissociative symptoms and hemodynamic symptoms were transient. Higher dose was a significant predictor of treatment response. Conclusions: These results demonstrate the potential role for ketamine in treating adolescents with TRD. Limitations include the open-label design and small sample; future research addressing these issues are needed to confirm these results. Additionally, evidence suggested a dose–response relationship; future studies are needed to optimize dose. Finally, questions remain regarding the long-term safety of ketamine as a depression treatment; more information is needed before broader clinical use.

The similarity of functional connectivity changes for drug-induced psychomimetic effects and symptoms of psychosis provides further support for the use of pharmacological challenges with psychomimetic drugs as models for psychosis.", "doi": "10.1089/brain.2014.0314", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26390148/", "secondary_title": "Brain Connect", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

A priori-planned analyses were conducted to compare responses between women and men, as well pre-vs. postmenopausal women. RESULTS: Analyses demonstrated no significant differences between women and men in terms of treatment response (F(1,80) = 0.06, p = 0.80). There were no significant differences in the frequency of adverse effects (AEs) reported by those assigned to ketamine treatment groups (p > 0.21 for all AEs reported more than once), although women reported more headaches (12% vs. 6%, p = 0.30) and nausea (10% vs. 6%, p = 0.47). In comparing pre-vs. postmenopausal women, no differences in efficacy were observed (F(1,76) = 0.36, p = 0.55).

METHODS: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched up to January 2015 for clinical trials and case reports describing therapeutic ketamine administration to patients presenting with SI/suicidality. Searches were also conducted for relevant background material regarding the pharmacological function of ketamine. RESULTS: Nine publications (six studies and three case reports) met the search criteria for assessing SI after administration of subanesthetic ketamine. There were no studies examining the effect on suicide attempts or death by suicide. Each study demonstrated a rapid and clinically significant reduction in SI, with results similar to previously described data on ketamine and treatment-resistant depression. A total of 137 patients with SI have been reported in the literature as receiving therapeutic ketamine. Seven studies delivered a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenously over 40 min, while one study administered a 0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and another study administered a liquid suspension. The earliest significant results were seen after 40 min, and the longest results were observed up to 10 days postinfusion. CONCLUSION: Consistent with clinical research on ketamine as a rapid and effective treatment for depression, ketamine has shown early preliminary evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms, as well as reducing SI, with minimal short-term side effects. Additional studies are needed to further investigate its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, and long-term adverse effects (including abuse) and benefits. In addition, ketamine could potentially be used as a prototype for further development of rapid-acting antisuicidal medication with a practical route of administration and the most favorable risk/benefit ratio.", "doi": "10.1007/s40268-015-0081-0", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25773961/", "secondary_title": "Drugs R D", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

METHOD: Based on data derived from a randomised clinical trial (N = 59), we performed exploratory analyses on the impact of escitalopram versus psilocybin (i.e. condition) on rumination and thought suppression from 1 week before to 6 weeks after treatment inception (i.e. time), using mixed analysis of variance. Condition responder versus non-responder subgroup analyses were also done, using the standard definition of ≥50% symptom reduction. RESULTS: A time×condition interaction was found for rumination (F(1, 56) = 4.58, P = 0.037) and thought suppression (F(1,57) = 5.88, P = 0.019), with post hoc tests revealing significant decreases exclusively in the psilocybin condition. When analysing via response, a significant time×condition×response interaction for thought suppression (F(1,54) = 8.42, P = 0.005) and a significant time×response interaction for rumination (F(1,54) = 23.50, P < 0.001) were evident. Follow-up tests revealed that decreased thought suppression was exclusive to psilocybin responders, whereas rumination decreased in both responder groups. In the psilocybin arm, decreases in rumination and thought suppression correlated with ego dissolution and session-linked psychological insight. CONCLUSIONS: These data provide further evidence on the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin and escitalopram in the treatment of depression.", "doi": "10.1192/bjo.2022.565", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36065128/", "secondary_title": "BJPsych Open", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Although several meta‐analyses have examined low‐dose intravenous (IV) ketamine, they do not distinguish between different types of infusions. Additionally, the many clinical trials published on ketamine vary by regimen of administration and surgical site. This review seeks to exclusively examine the evidence supporting the use of low‐dose IV infusion of ketamine for the management of perioperative pain. Methods: We searched Medline for any clinical trials or meta‐analyses that were conducted on low‐dose IV infusion of ketamine between 1966 and November 2013. Using six equations, we were left with 695 references. Of those, five meta‐analyses and 39 clinical trials met the criteria to be included our review. These clinical trials represent 2,482 patients, 1,403 of whom received ketamine. We then examined the efficacy of low‐dose IV ketamine by regimen and site of surgery using pain scores and opioid consumption as endpoints. Finally, we assessed the safety and long‐term impact of low‐dose ketamine. Results: Low‐dose IV ketamine reduces opioid consumption by 40%. It also lowers pain scores, but these findings are less clear. No major complications have been reported with low‐dose IV infusion of ketamine when given up to 48 hours after surgery. While our review lends support to using low‐dose IV infusion of ketamine in the management of perioperative pain, its optimal dose and regimen remain to be determined. Conclusions: Thirty‐nine clinical trials assessed a continuous infusion or a bolus of low‐dose ketamine for postoperative analgesia using reduction of pain scores or reduction of the opioid consumption as the primary endpoint. The mean reduction of opioid consumption when using low‐dose IV infusion ketamine (infusion rate less than 1.2 mg/kg/h) is 40%.

Objective: The present study therefore aimed to determine whether ecstasy users differed from controls in fear recognition at two time points: shortly after taking the drug and a few days later. Methods: Sixteen ecstasy users and 21 controls were compared on a facial expression recognition task involving the 6 basic emotions (happiness, surprise, sadness, anger, fear and disgust) and on self-ratings of mood on the night of drug use (day 0) and 4 days later (day 4). Results: In recognising fearful facial expressions, ecstasy users were more accurate than controls on day 0 but less accurate than them on day 4 when compared with their overall ability to recognise other basic emotions.

A key limitation for glutamate‐based treatment development is the lack of target‐engagement biomarkers for translation between pre‐clinical and earlystage clinical studies.

In one study, almost half of participants in the intervention group dropped out and this study was at high risk of attrition bias. The studies compared a single session of brief CBT or a web-based CBT to a waiting-list control (total sample size across studies of 129). Results were mixed across the studies. For the single-session brief CBT study, two out of five measures of drug use produced significant results, percentage of abstinent days in 90 days (odds ratio (OR) 0.22, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.02 to 2.11) and dependence symptoms (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.59, 95% CI -1.16 to -0.02). Little confidence could be placed in the results from this study give the small sample size (25 participants per group) and corresponding large CIs around the observed effects. For the web-based CBT, there was no significant difference across different outcomes. Neither study reported adverse effects. The meta-analytic mean across these two trials for drug use was not significant (SMD -0.28, 95% CI -0.69 to 0.14). In summary, overall quality of evidence was low and there was insufficient evidence to conclude that CBT is effective, or ineffective, at treating ATS use. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Currently, there is not enough evidence to establish the efficacy of CBT for ATS-use disorders because of a paucity of high-quality research in this area.", "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011315.pub2", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30577083/", "secondary_title": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Here we report the age and gender of offenders, along with the concentrations of amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymeth-amphetamine) in blood samples analyzed since the institution of the new legislation. Method: A forensic toxicology database (TOXBASE) was used to identify cases of DUID in which central stimulant amines were verified in blood during a 5-year period (2000-2004). Results: Amphetamine was present in 15,898 of 26,556 cases of DUID (60%) either alone or together with other licit or illicit drugs.

The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, cross‐over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects. Additionally, acute effects of LSD (0.1‐0.2 mg) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales (VASs), the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D‐ASC) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). Results: In healthy subjects, LSD acutely and dose‐dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, trust and closeness to others on the VASs. On the 5D‐ASC, LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg.

METHODS: We conducted an open-label, randomized, noninferiority trial involving patients referred to ECT clinics for treatment-resistant major depression. Patients with treatment-resistant major depression without psychosis were recruited and assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive ketamine or ECT. During an initial 3-week treatment phase, patients received either ECT three times per week or ketamine (0.5 mg per kilogram of body weight over 40 minutes) twice per week. The primary outcome was a response to treatment (i.e., a decrease of ≥50% from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression). The noninferiority margin was -10 percentage points. Secondary outcomes included scores on memory tests and patient-reported quality of life. After the initial treatment phase, the patients who had a response were followed over a 6-month period. RESULTS: A total of 403 patients underwent randomization at five clinical sites; 200 patients were assigned to the ketamine group and 203 to the ECT group.

There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of LSD, and its endocrine effects are unknown. In animals, LSD disrupts prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response, and patients with schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI. However, no data are available on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men). Outcome measures included psychometric scales; investigator ratings; PPI of the acoustic startle response; and autonomic, endocrine, and adverse effects. RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena. Subjective well-being, happiness, closeness to others, openness, and trust were increased by LSD. Compared with placebo, LSD decreased PPI. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, pupil size, plasma cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine. Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided within 72 hours. No severe acute adverse effects were observed.

Randomized controlled trials have failed to support these claims, but the laboratory-based dosing in trials conducted to date may have limited ecological validity. METHODS: Healthy male volunteers were randomized into lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (n = 40) and placebo (n = 40) groups and received 14 doses of either 10 μg LSD or an inactive placebo every 3 days for 6 weeks. First doses were given in a supervised laboratory setting, with other doses self-administered in a naturalistic setting. Results of safety data, blinding, daily questionnaires, expectancy, and pre-/postintervention psychometrics and cognitive tasks are presented here. RESULTS: The most notable reported adverse event was treatment-related anxiety, which prompted the withdrawal of 4 participants from the LSD group. Daily questionnaires showed credible evidence (>99% posterior probability) of improved ratings of creativity, connectedness, energy, happiness, irritability, and wellness on dose days compared with nondose days, and these effects remained when controlling for preintervention expectancy. No questionnaire or cognitive task showed a credible change between baseline and 6-week assessment time points.

The recreational use of ecstasy has been associated with potentially severe toxicity. Interindividual differences in the clinical toxicity of MDMA may result from alterations in drugmetabolizing enzymes, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases (CYPs). The role of genetic polymorphisms in CYP2D6 involved in the metabolism of MDMA is unclear. Therefore, effects of several CYP2D6 genetic variants, that are important for its activity, were characterized in healthy human subjects and examined for the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamic effects of MDMA. Methods: This was a prospectively designed pooled analysis of eight double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover studies in 142 Caucasian subjects. We included 71 male and 71 female aged between 18 ‐ 45 years. The drug was administered orally in a single dose with a dose range of 0.8‐2.7 mg/kg (mean = 1.7 mg/kg). Blood samples for pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamics measures were assessed repeatedly during the sessions. Subjective effects were assessed using Visual Analogue Scales (VAS) including: “any drug effect” and “drug liking”. Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyping was performed using commercial TaqMan SNP genotyping assays. Group differences were analyzed using one‐way analysis of variance (ANOVA), with genotype, enzyme activity score, CYP2D6 phenotype, and sex as between‐subjects group factors, followed by Tukey post hoc tests. To account for differences in body weight and dosing, plasma levels were dose‐normalized to the mean dose. Spearman rank correlations were used to assess associations between variables. Key results: In CYP2D6 poor metabolizers (PMs), the maximum concentrations (Cmax) of MDMA and its active metabolite 3,4‐methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) were +15% (P<0.05) and +50% (P<0.001) higher, respectively, compared with extensive metabolizers (EMs). The area under the concentration‐time curve (AUC) from 0 to 6 h after dosing (AUC6) of the inactive metabolite 4‐hydroxy‐3‐methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA) was 50% lower in intermediate metabolizers (IMs) compared with EMs (P<0.05). Blood pressure and subjective drug effects like “drug liking” increased more rapidly after MDMA administration in PMs than in EMs. The MDMA/HMMA AUC6 ratio, which inversely reflects CYP2D6 activity, correlated with the AUC values for any drug effect (P<0.001) and drug liking (P<0.001), indicating greater overall psychotropic effects in subjects with lower CYP2D6 function. Conclusions and Implications: The present study shows that the disposition of MDMA and its pharmacodynamics effects in humans are altered by polymorphic CYP2D6 activity. We found an increase in MDMA exposure and more rapid increases in the cardiostimulant and psychotropic effects of MDMA in subjects with poor CYP2D6 function. Although CYP2D6 PMs may be at increased risk for MDMA toxicity, the autoinhibition of CYP2D6 reduces the impact of the CYP2D6 genotype on MDMA PK. In fact, because CYP2D6 is inhibited by MDMA itself in all subjects, polymorphisms in other CYPs (e.g., CYP1A2, CYP2C19, and CYP2B6) and the pharmacological inhibition of CYP3A4 may actually become more clinically relevant than CYP2D6 genetics.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

As such, ECT provides an opportunity to rigorously study the recovery of consciousness, reconstitution of cognition, and electroencephalographic (EEG) activity following seizures. Fifteen patients with major depressive disorder refractory to pharmacologic therapy will be enrolled (Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT02761330). Adequate seizure duration will be confirmed following right unilateral ECT under etomidate anesthesia. Patients will then undergo randomization for the order in which they will receive three sequential treatments: etomidate + ECT, ketamine + ECT, and ketamine + sham ECT. Sessions will be repeated in the same sequence for a total of six treatments. Before each session, sensorimotor speed, working memory, and executive function will be assessed through a standardized cognitive test battery. After each treatment, the return of purposeful responsiveness to verbal command will be determined. At this point, serial cognitive assessments will begin using the same standardized test battery. The presence of delirium and changes in depression severity will also be ascertained. Sixty-four channel EEG will be acquired throughout baseline, ictal, and postictal epochs. Mixed-effects models will correlate the trajectories of cognitive recovery, clinical outcomes, and EEG metrics over time.

{"record_id": 6274, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Morphine']", "text": "PCA Ketamine-Morphine VS PCA Morphine as Post-Operative Analgesia in Colorectal Surgery.^\nINTRODUCTION Patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) is an established, efficient and safe technique for providing postoperative analgesia and has been associated with better pain relief and patient satisfaction with less postoperative complications and side effects [1]. Despite years of advances in pain management, opioids have been the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain particularly in moderate to severe pain. Of all opioids, morphine is the most studied drug and remains the drug of choice for PCA, especially in Malaysian hospitals. However, morphine usage is also associated with known side effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression [2]. A review of 32 studies involving opioids‐based PCA‐22 of which were PCA morphine‐reported an incidence of 19% nausea, 18.1% vomiting, 30.9 % of nausea and/or vomiting, 25.7% sedation, 17.9% urinary retention, 17.9% pruritus and 15.2% hypoxia and 1.6% respiratory depression that may be life‐threatening associated with PCA opioids use [3, 4]. The concept of multimodal analgesia hence was introduced to reduce opioid‐related side effects. Adjuvants such as acetaminophen and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs are commonly used nowadays in combination with opioids as opioid‐sparing agents to reduce opioid usage [5]. Ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has undergone a recent resurgence of interest among acute care providers as an adjunct in acute pain management [6, 7]. Ketamine at a sub‐anesthetic dose (0.2‐0.5 mg kg‐1) produces intense analgesia [5, 8]. Since its development in 1962, various studies have been conducted to prove the efficacy of ketamine as post‐operative analgesia and as an opioid‐sparing agent [8‐10]. A review by Laskowski and colleagues described that IV ketamine improved the quality of pain control, in addition to decreased opioid consumption with the particular benefit being observed in painful procedures, such as upper abdominal, thoracic, and major orthopedic surgeries [11]. While Carstensen and co‐workers in a qualitative review comparing PCA ketamine‐morphine with PCA morphine alone also described the superior efficacy of ketamine‐morphine in providing pain control with a significantly higher incidence of opioid‐related side effects in the morphine group [12]. In comparison to opioids, ketamine's lack of respiratory depressant effects also favors its use as an opioid adjunct in patients with airway and respiratory compromise, especially in morbid obesity and post‐thoracotomy patients [13, 14]. Despite the potential efficacy with published evidence of PCA ketamine‐morphine in postoperative pain management, its use is not well established in most Malaysian hospitals including the current study site. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA ketamine‐morphine in comparison to conventional PCA morphine alone as postoperative analgesia in colorectal surgery patients in the current study site. METHODS This prospective double‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru from February to October 2018 after obtaining ethics approval from the local and institutional ethics committee (NMRR‐17‐1863‐37291 & JEP‐2018‐092). Sixty elective American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients scheduled for lower midline laparotomy colorectal surgery aged between 18‐70 years old were recruited and informed consents were obtained. Patients with a known allergy to morphine or ketamine, uncontrolled hypertension, past history of chronic pain on regular analgesics, psychiatric illness on psychiatric drugs, BMI more than 35 and creatine clearance less than 30 were excluded from the study. All patients who consented were taught the usage of a PCA machine and the potential side effects of ketamine and morphine preoperatively. They were randomly allocated into either Group A or Group B by computer‐generated randomization a day before planned surgery. Group A r ceived PCA ketamine (Ketamine HCl, Pfizer Inc., US) 0.5 mg plus morphine 0.5 mg ml‐1 (ratio 1:1) while Group B received PCA morphine (Pfizer Inc., US) 1 mg ml‐1 as postoperative analgesia. There was no baseline infusion and the lock‐out period was set to 5 minutes. The study drugs were prepared one day before the surgery by the pharmacist who was not involved in the intraoperative and post‐=operative management of the patients. The drugs were labelled as study drugs with the study number. The patients, nurses who cared for the patients, the anesthetist who performed the anesthesia and the investigators who gathered the data were blinded to patients' group allocation. All patients had standard monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation and end‐tidal carbon dioxide (CO2). They were pre‐oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 2‐3 minutes. The induction of general anesthesia was standardized to intravenous (IV) fentanyl (Cephalon Inc., US) 2 mcg kg‐1, IV propofol (Diprivan, Pfizer Inc., US) 2 mg kg‐1 and IV rocuronium (US) 0.6 mg kg‐1 and intubation with the appropriate size of the endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (Suprane, Novartis AG, Switzerland) in a mixture of 50% of oxygen and 50% of air, and titrated to achieve a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1.0. All patients received IV dexamethasone (US) 8 mg after induction and IV morphine 0.1 mg kg‐1 as intraoperative analgesia. Boluses of IV fentanyl 25 mcg were given if extra analgesia was required and recorded. IV ondansetron (US) 4 mg was given upon initiation of skin closure. The skin incision site was infiltrated with 0.25% Bupivacaine (US) 10‐20 ml during skin closure. The standard dose of IV neostigmine and IV atropine was used to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. At the recovery bay, pain score was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), by which patients scored their pain intensity between number 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. If the pain score was > 4 at rest, IV morphine boluses were given and titrated according to the pre‐set morphine protocol until the pain score was ≤ 4. PCA machine with the study drug(s) was commenced once the pain score was ≤ 4 at rest. Patients were assessed 30 minutes after the commencement of PCA, at 6 hourly intervals for the first 24 hours and subsequently at 12 hourly intervals for the next 24 hours post‐operatively by the Acute Pain Service (APS) team. They were solely on PCA as post‐operative analgesia as the patients were kept nil by mouth for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All patients were assessed for pain score, sedation score, respiratory rate and other side effects of morphine and ketamine including nausea and vomiting, pruritus, dizziness and hallucinations. If the pain score was > 4 at rest during the assessment, 2 ml of PCA drug was given as boluses and titrated every 10 minutes to achieve a pain score ≤ 4. Cumulative morphine consumption was also recorded. Sedation was assessed using Pasero Opioid‐Induced Sedation Scale (POSS) (S ‐ sleep, easy to arouse, 1 ‐ awake and alert, 2 ‐ slightly drowsy, easy to arouse, 3 ‐ frequently drowsy, arousable, drift to sleep during the conversation, 4 ‐ somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal or physical stimulation). Treatment for nausea, vomiting and pruritus was given as deemed appropriate and recorded. At 48‐hour post‐operation, the patient's overall satisfaction score was assessed using 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 ‐ very unsatisfied, 2 ‐ unsatisfied, 3 ‐ neutral, 4 ‐ satisfied and 5 ‐ very satisfied). If patients experience hallucinations or delirium, PCA bolus dose was reduced by 0.2 ml and the symptoms were reassessed after 1 hour. If symptoms persist, the PCA bolus dose was reduced further by 0.2 ml every hour until symptoms disappear and PCA subsequently continued at the reduced dose. Patients with complicated surgeries in which they became haemodynamically unstable and required post‐operative ICU admission, developed anaphylaxis after commencement of study drugs, developed persistent delirium or hallucination after reduction of PCA bolus dose and pain was uncontrollable with the reduced dose or those who refused to continue with the study for any reasons were withdrawn from the study and given other means of analgesia as appropriate by the acute pain service (APS) team. The sample size was calculated using 'Power and Sample Size Calculations' program. The sample size was estimated using t‐test calculation as derived from mean pain score and standard deviation as quoted in a study by Javery and colleagues [15]. The α value was set at 0.05 and power of study at 90% and standard deviation at 1.67, whereby it was estimated that 27 patients were required for each group. Anticipating a 10% drop‐out rate, 30 patients were eventually recruited in each group, resulting in 60 patients for the whole study. All data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for The Social Sciences) software. Chi‐square test or Fisher exact test was used when appropriate to calculate any significant differences for categorical variables. Independent t‐test or Mann Whitney U test was used as appropriate to determine any significant differences for continuous variables. The incidence of side effects between the two groups was compared using Chi‐square test. A P value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT06021717", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

Group A r ceived PCA ketamine (Ketamine HCl, Pfizer Inc., US) 0.5 mg plus morphine 0.5 mg ml‐1 (ratio 1:1) while Group B received PCA morphine (Pfizer Inc., US) 1 mg ml‐1 as postoperative analgesia. There was no baseline infusion and the lock‐out period was set to 5 minutes. The study drugs were prepared one day before the surgery by the pharmacist who was not involved in the intraoperative and post‐=operative management of the patients. The drugs were labelled as study drugs with the study number. The patients, nurses who cared for the patients, the anesthetist who performed the anesthesia and the investigators who gathered the data were blinded to patients' group allocation. All patients had standard monitoring of blood pressure, electrocardiogram (ECG), oxygen saturation and end‐tidal carbon dioxide (CO2). They were pre‐oxygenated with 100% oxygen for 2‐3 minutes. The induction of general anesthesia was standardized to intravenous (IV) fentanyl (Cephalon Inc., US) 2 mcg kg‐1, IV propofol (Diprivan, Pfizer Inc., US) 2 mg kg‐1 and IV rocuronium (US) 0.6 mg kg‐1 and intubation with the appropriate size of the endotracheal tube. Anesthesia was maintained with desflurane (Suprane, Novartis AG, Switzerland) in a mixture of 50% of oxygen and 50% of air, and titrated to achieve a minimum alveolar concentration (MAC) of 1.0. All patients received IV dexamethasone (US) 8 mg after induction and IV morphine 0.1 mg kg‐1 as intraoperative analgesia. Boluses of IV fentanyl 25 mcg were given if extra analgesia was required and recorded. IV ondansetron (US) 4 mg was given upon initiation of skin closure. The skin incision site was infiltrated with 0.25% Bupivacaine (US) 10‐20 ml during skin closure. The standard dose of IV neostigmine and IV atropine was used to reverse residual neuromuscular blockade at the end of surgery. At the recovery bay, pain score was assessed using the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS), by which patients scored their pain intensity between number 0 to 10, with 0 being no pain at all and 10 being the worst pain imaginable. If the pain score was > 4 at rest, IV morphine boluses were given and titrated according to the pre‐set morphine protocol until the pain score was ≤ 4. PCA machine with the study drug(s) was commenced once the pain score was ≤ 4 at rest. Patients were assessed 30 minutes after the commencement of PCA, at 6 hourly intervals for the first 24 hours and subsequently at 12 hourly intervals for the next 24 hours post‐operatively by the Acute Pain Service (APS) team. They were solely on PCA as post‐operative analgesia as the patients were kept nil by mouth for the first 48 hours postoperatively. All patients were assessed for pain score, sedation score, respiratory rate and other side effects of morphine and ketamine including nausea and vomiting, pruritus, dizziness and hallucinations. If the pain score was > 4 at rest during the assessment, 2 ml of PCA drug was given as boluses and titrated every 10 minutes to achieve a pain score ≤ 4. Cumulative morphine consumption was also recorded. Sedation was assessed using Pasero Opioid‐Induced Sedation Scale (POSS) (S ‐ sleep, easy to arouse, 1 ‐ awake and alert, 2 ‐ slightly drowsy, easy to arouse, 3 ‐ frequently drowsy, arousable, drift to sleep during the conversation, 4 ‐ somnolent, minimal or no response to verbal or physical stimulation). Treatment for nausea, vomiting and pruritus was given as deemed appropriate and recorded. At 48‐hour post‐operation, the patient's overall satisfaction score was assessed using 1 to 5 Likert scale (1 ‐ very unsatisfied, 2 ‐ unsatisfied, 3 ‐ neutral, 4 ‐ satisfied and 5 ‐ very satisfied). If patients experience hallucinations or delirium, PCA bolus dose was reduced by 0.2 ml and the symptoms were reassessed after 1 hour. If symptoms persist, the PCA bolus dose was reduced further by 0.2 ml every hour until symptoms disappear and PCA subsequently continued at the reduced dose. Patients with complicated surgeries in which they became haemodynamically unstable and required post‐operative ICU admission, developed anaphylaxis after commencement of study drugs, developed persistent delirium or hallucination after reduction of PCA bolus dose and pain was uncontrollable with the reduced dose or those who refused to continue with the study for any reasons were withdrawn from the study and given other means of analgesia as appropriate by the acute pain service (APS) team. The sample size was calculated using 'Power and Sample Size Calculations' program. The sample size was estimated using t‐test calculation as derived from mean pain score and standard deviation as quoted in a study by Javery and colleagues [15]. The α value was set at 0.05 and power of study at 90% and standard deviation at 1.67, whereby it was estimated that 27 patients were required for each group. Anticipating a 10% drop‐out rate, 30 patients were eventually recruited in each group, resulting in 60 patients for the whole study. All data were analyzed using the SPSS (Statistical Package for The Social Sciences) software. Chi‐square test or Fisher exact test was used when appropriate to calculate any significant differences for categorical variables. Independent t‐test or Mann Whitney U test was used as appropriate to determine any significant differences for continuous variables.

Despite years of advances in pain management, opioids have been the mainstay for treatment of postoperative pain particularly in moderate to severe pain. Of all opioids, morphine is the most studied drug and remains the drug of choice for PCA, especially in Malaysian hospitals. However, morphine usage is also associated with known side effects such as sedation, nausea and vomiting, pruritus, urinary retention and respiratory depression [2]. A review of 32 studies involving opioids‐based PCA‐22 of which were PCA morphine‐reported an incidence of 19% nausea, 18.1% vomiting, 30.9 % of nausea and/or vomiting, 25.7% sedation, 17.9% urinary retention, 17.9% pruritus and 15.2% hypoxia and 1.6% respiratory depression that may be life‐threatening associated with PCA opioids use [3, 4]. The concept of multimodal analgesia hence was introduced to reduce opioid‐related side effects. Adjuvants such as acetaminophen and non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs are commonly used nowadays in combination with opioids as opioid‐sparing agents to reduce opioid usage [5]. Ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, has undergone a recent resurgence of interest among acute care providers as an adjunct in acute pain management [6, 7]. Ketamine at a sub‐anesthetic dose (0.2‐0.5 mg kg‐1) produces intense analgesia [5, 8]. Since its development in 1962, various studies have been conducted to prove the efficacy of ketamine as post‐operative analgesia and as an opioid‐sparing agent [8‐10]. A review by Laskowski and colleagues described that IV ketamine improved the quality of pain control, in addition to decreased opioid consumption with the particular benefit being observed in painful procedures, such as upper abdominal, thoracic, and major orthopedic surgeries [11]. While Carstensen and co‐workers in a qualitative review comparing PCA ketamine‐morphine with PCA morphine alone also described the superior efficacy of ketamine‐morphine in providing pain control with a significantly higher incidence of opioid‐related side effects in the morphine group [12]. In comparison to opioids, ketamine's lack of respiratory depressant effects also favors its use as an opioid adjunct in patients with airway and respiratory compromise, especially in morbid obesity and post‐thoracotomy patients [13, 14]. Despite the potential efficacy with published evidence of PCA ketamine‐morphine in postoperative pain management, its use is not well established in most Malaysian hospitals including the current study site. Hence, the aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of PCA ketamine‐morphine in comparison to conventional PCA morphine alone as postoperative analgesia in colorectal surgery patients in the current study site. METHODS This prospective double‐blind randomized controlled trial was conducted in Hospital Sultanah Aminah Johor Bahru from February to October 2018 after obtaining ethics approval from the local and institutional ethics committee (NMRR‐17‐1863‐37291 & JEP‐2018‐092). Sixty elective American Society of Anaesthesiologists (ASA) I or II patients scheduled for lower midline laparotomy colorectal surgery aged between 18‐70 years old were recruited and informed consents were obtained. Patients with a known allergy to morphine or ketamine, uncontrolled hypertension, past history of chronic pain on regular analgesics, psychiatric illness on psychiatric drugs, BMI more than 35 and creatine clearance less than 30 were excluded from the study. All patients who consented were taught the usage of a PCA machine and the potential side effects of ketamine and morphine preoperatively. They were randomly allocated into either Group A or Group B by computer‐generated randomization a day before planned surgery.

METHODS: Using 2947 publicly available online reports, we compared Ayahuasca and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT, analyzed together), ketamine, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin (mushroom), and antidepressant drug use experiences. We examined word frequencies related to various psychological states and processes and semantic proximity to psychedelic and mystical experience scales. RESULTS: Linguistic markers of psychological function indicated distinct effect profiles. For example, MDMA experience reports featured an emotionally intensifying profile accompanied by many cognitive process words and dynamic-personal language. In contrast, Ayahuasca and DMT experience reports involved relatively little emotional language, few cognitive process words, increased analytical thinking-associated language, and the most semantic similarity with psychedelic and mystical experience descriptions. LSD, psilocybin mushroom, and ketamine reports showed only small differences on the emotion-, analytical thinking-, psychedelic, and mystical experience-related language outcomes. Antidepressant reports featured more negative emotional and cognitive process-related words, fewer positive emotional and analytical thinking-related words, and were generally not similar to mystical and psychedelic language. CONCLUSION: This article addresses an existing research gap regarding the comparison of different psychedelic drugs on linguistic profiles of psychological states, processes, and experiences. The large sample of experience reports involving multiple psychedelic drugs provides valuable information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain.

RESULTS: Linguistic markers of psychological function indicated distinct effect profiles. For example, MDMA experience reports featured an emotionally intensifying profile accompanied by many cognitive process words and dynamic-personal language. In contrast, Ayahuasca and DMT experience reports involved relatively little emotional language, few cognitive process words, increased analytical thinking-associated language, and the most semantic similarity with psychedelic and mystical experience descriptions. LSD, psilocybin mushroom, and ketamine reports showed only small differences on the emotion-, analytical thinking-, psychedelic, and mystical experience-related language outcomes. Antidepressant reports featured more negative emotional and cognitive process-related words, fewer positive emotional and analytical thinking-related words, and were generally not similar to mystical and psychedelic language. CONCLUSION: This article addresses an existing research gap regarding the comparison of different psychedelic drugs on linguistic profiles of psychological states, processes, and experiences. The large sample of experience reports involving multiple psychedelic drugs provides valuable information that would otherwise be difficult to obtain. The results could inform experimental research into psychedelic drug effects in healthy populations and clinical trials for psychedelic treatments of psychiatric problems.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-022-06062-3", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35031816/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)", "annotation": "Substance(s)"}

Quantitative linguistic analysis is a powerful tool to examine such differences.

Specifically, its pharmacological efficacy in treatment refractory depression is considered a major breakthrough in the field. However, the mechanism of action of ketamine's rapid effect remains to be determined. In order to identify pathways that are responsible for ketamine's effect, a targeted metabolomic approach was carried out using a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design, with infusion order randomized with medication-free patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (29 subjects) and healthy controls (25 subjects).

In a pre-registered analysis, we tested whether changes in an a priori set of imaging measures from a target neural circuit were predictive of improvement in PTSD symptoms, using leave-one-out cross-validated elastic-net regression models (regions of interest in the target circuit consisted of the dorsal and rostral anterior cingulate cortex, ventromedial prefrontal cortex, anterior hippocampus, anterior insula, and amygdala).

Methods: In a cross-sectional design, 30 current and 31 ex-ecstasy users with ecstasy abstinence of at least 5 months, and 29 polydrug and 30 drug-naive controls were compared on measures of psychopathology, cognitive performance and serotonin transporter availability. Results: The groups did not differ significantly in age, gender distribution, education level and premorbid intelligence. The ecstasy groups did not differ significantly from polydrug controls on most of the relevant parameters of concomitant illegal drug use. Reported drug use was confirmed by hair and urine analyses. All three groups of drug users exhibited significantly elevated psychopathology compared with drug-naive controls. Only ex-ecstasy users were significantly impaired on verbal recall. Current ecstasy users showed significantly reduced distribution volume ratios of serotonin transporter availability in the mesencephalon and caudate nucleus. Regression analyses indicated that psychopathology and serotonergic alterations were best predicted by the number of ecstasy tablets taken on a typical event. Conclusion: The results indicate that verbal memory impairments were possibly aggravated after prolonged ecstasy abstinence while there was tentative evidence of serotonergic recovery. On the other hand, self-reported elevated psychopathology appeared to be associated with polydrug use in general and not specifically with ecstasy use.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-002-1383-9", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12632248/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks.

Use of MDMA (ecstasy), a serotonin neurotoxin, has been associated with memory impairment and psychological dysfunction. This study examined cognitive functioning in abstinent MDMA users and MDMA-naïve controls. Method. Participants completed measures of intelligence, motor function, attention, memory span, verbal fluency, immediate and delayed verbal memory, and working memory. They were also assessed for the presence of psychopathology. In addition to comparing cognitive function in MDMA users relative to controls, the possibility that clinically dysfunctional MDMA use increases the risk of cognitive impairment was examined. Results. MDMA users exhibited relative deficits in mnemonic and executive functions.

The Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments (CANMAT) convened a task force to review the evidence and provide a consensus recommendation for the clinical use of psychedelic treatments for major depressive disorder. METHODS: A systematic review was conducted to identify contemporary clinical trials of serotonergic psychedelics for the treatment of major depressive disorder and cancer-related depression. Studies published between January 1990 and July 2021 were identified using combinations of search terms, inspection of bibliographies and review of other psychedelic reviews and consensus statements. The levels of evidence for efficacy were graded according to the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments criteria. RESULTS: Only psilocybin and ayahuasca have contemporary clinical trials evaluating antidepressant effects. Two pilot studies showed preliminary positive effects of single-dose ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression (Level 3 evidence).

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2018-36570-001[/rid]). Ketamine is a popular recreational drug among young people in Hong Kong. Long-term abuse of ketamine can lead to acute urological and medical issues, which often require immediate care at emergency rooms. Many patients require short-term hospitalization for medical management. This opens a brief time window, within which mental health professionals could engage young people who abuses ketamine in psychosocial, functional, and lifestyle interventions. The Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) is a short-term hospitalization and community support program that addresses the health care needs of young people who abuse ketamine. During short-term hospitalization, the patient participates in a range of cognitive and psychosocial assessments, motivational interviewing, emotions management, and lifestyle re-design interventions. Upon discharge, social work professionals of non-government agencies continue to work with the patients on their action plans in the community. This evaluation study uses a quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design, in which the outcomes of the treatment group (n = 84) are compared with a comparison group (n = 34) who have a history of ketamine abuse but who have not joined the treatment program. The results confirm that the treatment group showed significant increases in motivation for treatment, reduction in drug use, improvement in cognitive screening tests, healthy lifestyle scores, and self-efficacy in avoidance of drugs over 13 weeks. When compared with the comparison group, the treatment group had significant decreases in anxiety and treatment needs and had moved from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage. However, there were no significant changes in outcome measures covering lifestyle or self-efficacy in drug avoidance. Overall, the CAP is effective in reducing drug use, anxiety, and helping patients to move from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage of change. The study results suggest that health care professionals can successfully engage young people who abuse ketamine to participate in a package of psychosocial interventions, motivational interviewing, and lifestyle re-design during their hospital stay for management of urological problems. The CAP also highlights the importance of collaboration between hospitals and community social services in the management of addiction.

We hypothesized that even lower doses of ketamine would be sufficient, with minimal side effects, when used as a component of multimodal perioperative pain management. METHODS: In this triple-blinded, randomized, active- and placebo-controlled clinical trial, patients undergoing elective major abdominal surgery were randomized to one of three treatment groups: low-dose S-ketamine (a 0.25 mg/kg bolus and 0.125 mg/kg/h infusion for 48 hours), minimal-dose S-ketamine (a 0.015 mg/kg/h infusion following a saline bolus), and placebo (saline bolus and infusion). Opioid consumption, pain levels, hyperalgesia at the incision site, and delirium scores were assessed 48 h postoperatively. RESULTS: Patients in the placebo group had the highest cumulative piritramide consumption and the largest normalized areas of hyperalgesia at the incisional site, while those in the low-dose group had the highest delirium scores.

Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent for participation, the day before infusion (Day ‐1), participants will complete a set of rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID; 30μg/kg over 40 minutes). We will randomize infusion sequences in a 1‐to‐1 ratio: KET followed by MID (K→M) or vice versa (M→K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and Day 21, separated by a 20‐day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. We will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Days ‐1, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41. Patients will provide daily self‐ratings of depressive symptoms (using the quick inventory of depressive symptoms 16‐item self‐rated version; QIDS 16‐SR). Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following the second infusion. Study Groups: Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30μg/kg of MID diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter reduces the response to ketamine.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT05625555", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Female users showed no impairments on any of the tasks. Conclusions: The present data suggest that a history of MDMA use selectively impairs executive function. In male users, cognitive flexibility was impaired and increased perseverative behavior was observed. The inability to adjust behavior rapidly and flexibly may have repercussions for daily life activities.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-004-1832-8", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15034712/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

The primary end point was the change from baseline to week 3 in the total score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS; range, 0 to 60, with higher scores indicating more severe depression). Secondary end points included response at week 3 (≥50% decrease from baseline in the MADRS total score), remission at week 3 (MADRS total score ≤10), and sustained response at 12 weeks (meeting response criteria at week 3 and all subsequent visits). RESULTS: A total of 79 participants were in the 25-mg group, 75 in the 10-mg group, and 79 in the 1-mg group. The mean MADRS total score at baseline was 32 or 33 in each group.

Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels.

These findings highlight marked changes in oscillatory activity and signal diversity with DMT that parallel broad and specific components of the subjective experience, thus advancing our understanding of the neurobiological underpinnings of immersive states of consciousness.", "doi": "10.1038/s41598-019-51974-4", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31745107/", "secondary_title": "Sci Rep", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Drugs of both classes are being pursued as novel treatments for mood disorders. While classic and dissociative hallucinogens have different pharmacologic mechanisms of action, they may have similar subjective and neuropsychological effects. The objective of this double‐blind, placebo controlled crossover study was to compare the neuropsychological effects of multiple doses of the classic hallucinogen psilocybin with the effects of a single high dose of the dissociative hallucinogen dextromethorphan. Methods: Twenty hallucinogen users (11 F, 9M) completed five drug administration sessions lasting 6 to 8 hours each. During each session, volunteers self‐administered capsules containing placebo, one of three doses (10, 20, and 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin, or a dose dextromethorphan (DXM; 400 mg/70 kg). Dose order was counter‐balanced across volunteers using a 5‐order Williams design. Before capsule administration and at peak drug effect, volunteers were assessed for overall cognitive impairment using the Mini‐ Mental State Examination. Computerized neuropsychological tasks measuring psychomotor performance (the Motor Praxis test), working (the Letter N‐Back test) and episodic memory (word encoding, recall, and recognition), executive function and associative learning (the Digit Symbol Substitution Task, or DSST), and visual perception (the Penn Line Orientation Task, or PLOT) were assessed at various points throughout the timecourse of drug effects. The DSST and episodic memory tasks were programmed within the Presentation software package. The Motor Praxis, Letter N‐Back, and PLOT tasks were administered as part of the Penn Computerized Neurocognitive Battery (CNB). Multiple task forms were administered in order to minimize learning effects. Task order was counterbalanced across participants, and orthogonalized in relation to dose order. Outcome measures for each task were analyzed using a mixed‐effects repeated measures ANCOVA using the lmer function of the lme4 library and the lmerTest library within the R statistical environment. Responses were nested within subject, testing a main effect of drug condition and using average mpraxis response times for the given assessment period as a covariate to control for general effects of psychomotor slowing on performance of each task. For the DSST and Letter N‐Back analyses, responses were also nested within drug condition and a main effect of time point (for the DSST) or task condition (for the Letter N‐Back) was included, as DSST was assessed at multiple timepoints within each session, and the Letter N‐Back contained multiple task conditions. Results: Overall cognitive impairment, as assessed with the Mini‐Mental State Examination, was not observed with psilocybin or DXM. Orderly and dose‐dependent effects of psilocybin were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, episodic memory, associative learning, and visual perception. Effects of a high dose of DXM were observed, and consisted of impairments of psychomotor performance, working memory, visual perception, and associative learning that were in the range of effects of a moderate to high dose (20 to 30 mg/ 70 kg) of psilocybin. Psilocybin had greater effects than DXM on measures of working memory. DXM had greater effects than all doses of psilocybin on measures of word recognition sensitivity, response inhibition, and executive control. Conclusions: Psilocybin exerted selective effects on working memory, whereas DXM selective effects on episodic memory, response inhibition, and executive control. Notably, this is the first time that dose‐dependent effects of psilocybin were demonstrated for measures related to verbal working memory, episodic memory, and executive function.

The current study, employing a larger sample (44 current Ecstasy users, and 59 non-Ecstasy users), together with more effective statistical controls for other drug use, failed to replicate previous findings. Ecstasy users were unimpaired on all measures of random generation performance. A significant difference was obtained on the computation span measure, with Ecstasy users scoring significantly lower than non-Ecstasy users. This difference remained statistically significant following control for various indicators of the use of other drugs including cannabis. The results are discussed in terms of the potential effects that Ecstasy might have on different component executive processes.", "doi": "10.1348/0007126042369785", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15527532/", "secondary_title": "Br J Psychol", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

This talk will review the typical therapeutic approach, along with some of the major findings in this area to date, with a focus on the results from a prospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with moderate to severe depression who received 2 doses of psilocybin in a supported setting. Methods: This randomized, waiting‐list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21 to 75 years with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID‐HAMD ≥17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received 2 doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty‐four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose. Results: All 24 participants attended all follow‐up visits through the 12‐month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID‐HAMD) scores were observed at 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (≥50% reduction in GRID‐HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long‐term follow‐up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after the sessions predicted increased well‐being at 12 months but did not predict improvement in depression. One‐third of the participants began treatment with an antidepressant medication during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients.
