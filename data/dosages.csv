 CONTEXT : Ketamine evokes psychosislike symptoms , and its primary action is to impair N - methyl - D - aspartate glutamate receptor neurotransmission , but it also induces secondary increases in glutamate release . OBJECTIVES : To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine . DESIGN : Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized , crossover , counterbalanced - order design . In the first experiment , the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level - dependent ( BOLD ) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo . In the second experiment , pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release . SETTING : Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility , Manchester , England . PARTICIPANTS : Thirty - three healthy , right - handed men were recruited by advertisements . INTERVENTIONS : In experiment 1 , participants were given intravenous ketamine ( 1 - minute bolus of 0.26 mg / kg , followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg / kg / h for the remainder of the session ) or placebo ( 0.9 % saline solution ) . In experiment 2 , participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1 . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES : Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale scores . RESULTS : Ketamine induced a rapid , focal , and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex , including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate , which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid - posterior cingulate , thalamus , and temporal cortical regions ( r = 0.90 ) . Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores . Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms . CONCLUSIONS : These 2 changes may underpin 2 fundamental processes of psychosis : abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive - emotional evaluation of their significance . The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release ."

0.5 mg / kg	6361	received a single subanesthetic ( 0.5 mg / kg ) ketamine infusion over 40	"Clinical predictors of ketamine response in treatment - resistant major depression.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : The N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and bipolar depression . Clinical predictors may identify those more likely to benefit from ketamine within clinically heterogeneous populations . METHOD : Data were analyzed from 4 studies of treatment - resistant inpatients with DSM - IV - TR - diagnosed MDD or bipolar I or II depression . Patients who were currently experiencing a moderate - to - severe major depressive episode were enrolled between November 2004 and March 2013 . All subjects received a single subanesthetic ( 0.5 mg / kg ) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes . Patients were analyzed at the 230 - minute postinfusion time point ( n = 108 ) , at day 1 ( n = 82 ) , and at day 7 ( n = 71 ) . Univariate Pearson correlations were performed for each variable with percent change from baseline in the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) . Multivariate linear regression was then conducted for statistically significant predictors ( P ≤ .05 , 2 - tailed ) . RESULTS : Higher body mass index correlated with greater HDRS improvement at 230 minutes ( standardized β = -0.30 , P = .004 ) and at day 1 ( standardized β = -0.37 , P = .001 ) , but not at day 7 ( standardized β = -0.18 , P = .10 ) . Family history of an alcohol use disorder in a first - degree relative was associated with greater HDRS improvement at day 1 ( standardized β = -0.27 , P = .014 ) and day 7 ( standardized β = -0.41 , P < .001 ) . No prior history of suicide attempt(s ) was associated with greater improvement only at day 7 ( standardized β = 0.28 , P = .01 ) . The overall statistical model explained 13 % , 23 % , and 36 % of HDRS percent change variance at 230 minutes , day 1 , and day 7 , respectively . CONCLUSIONS : Despite its post hoc nature , this study identified several clinical correlates of ketamine 's rapid and durable antidepressant effects . Further investigation of these relationships is critical for individualized treatment of depression ."

 IMPORTANCE : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a substantial public health burden , but current treatments have limited effectiveness and adherence . Recent evidence suggests that 1 or 2 administrations of psilocybin with psychological support produces antidepressant effects in patients with cancer and in those with treatment - resistant depression . OBJECTIVE : To investigate the effect of psilocybin therapy in patients with MDD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : This randomized , waiting list - controlled clinical trial was conducted at the Center for Psychedelic and Consciousness Research at Johns Hopkins Bayview Medical Center in Baltimore , Maryland . Adults aged 21 to 75 years with an MDD diagnosis , not currently using antidepressant medications , and without histories of psychotic disorder , serious suicide attempt , or hospitalization were eligible to participate . Enrollment occurred between August 2017 and April 2019 , and the 4 - week primary outcome assessments were completed in July 2019 . A total of 27 participants were randomized to an immediate treatment condition group ( n = 15 ) or delayed treatment condition group ( waiting list control condition ; n = 12 ) . Data analysis was conducted from July 1 , 2019 , to July 31 , 2020 , and included participants who completed the intervention ( evaluable population ) . INTERVENTIONS : Two psilocybin sessions ( session 1 : 20 mg/70 kg ; session 2 : 30 mg/70 kg ) were given ( administered in opaque gelatin capsules with approximately 100 mL of water ) in the context of supportive psychotherapy ( approximately 11 hours ) . Participants were randomized to begin treatment immediately or after an 8 - week delay . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : The primary outcome , depression severity was assessed with the GRID - Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( GRID - HAMD ) scores at baseline ( score of ≥17 required for enrollment ) and weeks 5 and 8 after enrollment for the delayed treatment group , which corresponded to weeks 1 and 4 after the intervention for the immediate treatment group . Secondary outcomes included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self Rated ( QIDS - SR ) . RESULTS : Of the randomized participants , 24 of 27 ( 89 % ) completed the intervention and the week 1 and week 4 postsession assessments . This population had a mean ( SD ) age of 39.8 ( 12.2 ) years , was composed of 16 women ( 67 % ) , and had a mean ( SD ) baseline GRID - HAMD score of 22.8 ( 3.9 ) . The mean ( SD ) GRID - HAMD scores at weeks 1 and 4 ( 8.0 [ 7.1 ] and 8.5 [ 5.7 ] ) in the immediate treatment group were statistically significantly lower than the scores at the comparable time points of weeks 5 and 8 ( 23.8 [ 5.4 ] and 23.5 [ 6.0 ] ) in the delayed treatment group . The effect sizes were large at week 5 ( Cohen d = 2.5 ; 95 % CI , 1.4 - 3.5 ; P < .001 ) and week 8 ( Cohen d = 2.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.5 - 3.7 ; P < .001 ) . The QIDS - SR documented a rapid decrease in mean ( SD ) depression score from baseline to day 1 after session 1 ( 16.7 [ 3.5 ] vs 6.3 [ 4.4 ] ; Cohen d = 2.6 ; 95 % CI , 1.8 - 3.5 ; P < .001 ) , which remained statistically significantly reduced through the week 4 follow - up ( 6.0 [ 5.7 ] ; Cohen d = 2.3 ; 95 % CI , 1.5 - 3.0 ; P < .001 ) . In the overall sample , 17 participants ( 71 % ) at week 1 and 17 ( 71 % ) at week 4 had a clinically significant response to the intervention ( ≥50 % reduction in GRID - HAMD score ) , and 14 participants ( 58 % ) at week 1 and 13 participants ( 54 % ) at week 4 were in remission ( ≤7 GRID - HAMD score ) . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : Findings suggest that psilocybin with therapy is efficacious in treating MDD , thus extending the results of previous studies of this intervention in patients with cancer and depression and of a nonrandomized study in patients with treatment - resistant depression .

 The proposed study is a double‐blind , controlled investigation of the effect of 1 high‐dose psilocybin ( 30 mg ) session compared to a very low dose session ( 1 mg ) following standard‐of‐care buprenorphine induction on drug abstinence , quality of life , craving , tobacco use , and treatment retention in healthy participants with an active OUD diagnosis . Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care , and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence , treatment adherence , quality of life , and mood . The study will consist of a brief ( 6‐8 day ) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration , an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings , and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after . During the inpatient phase , participants will be inducted onto sublingual ( SL ) buprenorphine ( using a buprenorphine / naloxone combination product ) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit . During this time , participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions , and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions , during which the participants will receive either a very low dose ( 1 mg ) or a single high ( 30 mg ) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions . At the end of the inpatient phase , participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase , during which participants will undergo visits at 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 6 , and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events , clinical status , treatment adherence , and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine . All buprenorphine procedures will be open label and will follow standard‐of‐care practices . This trial utilizes a Bayesian sequential methodology , employing a maximum sample size of 90 participants and calculating Bayes factors ( starting at 20 participants and assessed after each 10 ) to assess evidence for the null and experimental hypotheses , enabling potential early stopping for efficacy or futility based on predetermined thresholds ( Bayes factor of 6 and 1/6 ) . This will be calculated for the primary outcome of opioid abstinence at 8‐weeks"

0.1 to 0.5 mg / Kg	1364	studies , dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg / Kg of racemic ketamine and 0.5–1	"Subcutaneous ketamine in depression : A systematic review.^ 
 Background : Ketamine has been shown to produce a rapid and robust antidepressant effect . Though numerous routes of administration have been studied , subcutaneous ( SC ) has proven to be a convenient and cost - effective route making its use particularly relevant in developing countries . Here we provide a systematic review covering the use of SC racemic ketamine and esketamine in depression , including its efficacy , safety and tolerability . Methods : A systematic literature search was carried out , from inception through March , 2021 , using PubMed / MEDLINE , EMBASE and Web of Science , with no limits of language . After identifying 159 potentially relevant articles , 12 articles were selected after applying our inclusion / exclusion criteria . These comprised two randomized clinical trials , five case - reports and five retrospective studies . Given the small number of studies found and their heterogeneous nature , a meta - analysis was not considered appropriate . Here we provide a synthesis of these data including participant characteristics , dose range , efficacy , safety/ tolerability . Risk of bias was accessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool . Results : SC Ketamine was administered to unipolar and bipolar patients a single or multiple doses , weekly or twice - weekly , a dose - titration approach was made in major studies , dose ranged from 0.1 to 0.5 mg / Kg of racemic ketamine and 0.5–1 mg / Kg of esketamine . Across all studies , SC ketamine showed a rapid and robust antidepressant effect , with response/ remission rates from 50 to 100 % following both single or multiple doses , with transitory side effects .

25 mg	3492	two open - label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants	"Nature - themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin - assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^ 
 INTRODUCTION : Psychedelic - assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder ( AUD ) . Set and setting , particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature , may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes . But to date , randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic - assisted therapy are lacking . METHODS : This was a pilot randomized , controlled trial of Visual Healing , a nature - themed video intervention to optimize set and setting , versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open - label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD . For the first session , participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature - themed videos during the preparation session and the "" ascent "" and "" descent "" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session . For the second session 4 weeks later , participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures . Primary outcomes were feasibility , safety , and tolerability of Visual Healing . Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use , psychedelic effects , anxiety and stress . RESULTS : Nineteen of 20 ( 95 % ) randomized participants ( mean age 49 ± 11 years , 60 % female ) completed the 14 - week study . During the first psilocybin session , participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42 - min video and there were no video - related adverse events . Peak increase in post - psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures . Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects , stress , and anxiety were similar between groups . DISCUSSION : In this open - label pilot study , viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible , safe , and well - tolerated among participants with AUD . Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy , without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol - related treatment outcomes . Studies to replicate our findings as well as studies of different set and setting interventions with other psychedelic medications and indications are warranted ."
80 mg	2912	loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance	"Safety , pharmacokinetic , and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple - dose regimen in opioid - dependent subjects.^ 
 Opioid dependence is a significant public health issue . Improved non‐addictive , non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed . Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence , but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility . Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects . Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated , but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval . This study evaluated the safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , and pharmacodynamics ( PD ) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects . Background : The development of treatments for opioid dependence , a significant public health issue , is of high importance . Educational objectives include : ( 1 ) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive , non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence , ( 2 ) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation ( QTcF > 500 msec or ΔQTcF > 60 msec ) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval , ( 3 ) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population . Methods : This was a phase 1B , open‐label , titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit . A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing ( 10 , 20 , 30 , or 40 mg , q6h ) for up to 5 days . Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation ( QTcF > 500 msec or ΔQTcF > 60 msec was exclusionary ) . Standard safety evaluations , PK , and PD assessments ( eg , opioid withdrawal and mood scales ) were conducted . Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry . Results : Nine subjects ( 6 males ; mean age 31.2 years ) were enrolled . Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids . Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80 mg to 670 mg , with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses ( mean 653 mg , range 640‐670 mg ) . No serious adverse events ( AEs ) were reported . Of treatmentemergent AEs , 96 % were mild in severity , none were severe and 58 % were opioid withdrawal‐related . Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability , even between subjects with similar unit / daily / total doses . Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 ( mean 102 ) ng / mL. After oral administration of noribogaine , observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open , 2 compartment first‐order absorption model . Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects ( 5 ) and within 48 hours for the remaining ( 2 ) . The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec ( mean 33 msec ) . A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed , corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng / mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation . Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine , and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects . Mean ( SD ) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 ( 10.6 ) and declined to 16.8 ( 7.4 ) one hour after loading dose administration ; at 51 hours post‐loading dose , mean SOWS score was 10.4 ( 9.7 ) . Mean ( SD ) POMS total mood disturbance ( TMD ) score was 53.8 ( 22.2 ) at baseline and declined to 37.3 ( 43.3 ) at 57 hours post‐loading dose . Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal , 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration ( mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose ) , 2 of whom withdrew from the study . All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores ( SOWS : 4.8 ( 4.9 ) at 81 h ; POMS TMD : 0.8 ( 4.6 ) at 84 h ) . Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment , largely devoid of support ; 5 subjects relapsed , 3 were lost to follow‐up , and 1 remained abstinent ( 15 weeks ) . Conclusions : Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated . The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed , and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation ( i.e. , no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF > 60 msec ) . Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose . Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration . These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials . Educational Objectives : At the conclusions of this activity , participants should be able to : 1 . Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive , nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence . 2 . Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation . 3 .

 Opioid dependence is a significant public health issue . Improved non‐addictive , non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed . Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence , but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility . Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects . Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated , but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval . This study evaluated the safety , pharmacokinetics ( PK ) , and pharmacodynamics ( PD ) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects . Background : The development of treatments for opioid dependence , a significant public health issue , is of high importance . Educational objectives include : ( 1 ) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive , non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence , ( 2 ) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation ( QTcF > 500 msec or ΔQTcF > 60 msec ) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval , ( 3 ) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population . Methods : This was a phase 1B , open‐label , titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit . A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing ( 10 , 20 , 30 , or 40 mg , q6h ) for up to 5 days . Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation ( QTcF > 500 msec or ΔQTcF > 60 msec was exclusionary ) . Standard safety evaluations , PK , and PD assessments ( eg , opioid withdrawal and mood scales ) were conducted . Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry . Results : Nine subjects ( 6 males ; mean age 31.2 years ) were enrolled . Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids . Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80 mg to 670 mg , with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses ( mean 653 mg , range 640‐670 mg ) . No serious adverse events ( AEs ) were reported . Of treatmentemergent AEs , 96 % were mild in severity , none were severe and 58 % were opioid withdrawal‐related . Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability , even between subjects with similar unit / daily / total doses . Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 ( mean 102 ) ng / mL. After oral administration of noribogaine , observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open , 2 compartment first‐order absorption model . Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects ( 5 ) and within 48 hours for the remaining ( 2 ) . The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec ( mean 33 msec ) . A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed , corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng / mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation . Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine , and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects . Mean ( SD ) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 ( 10.6 ) and declined to 16.8 ( 7.4 ) one hour after loading dose administration ; at 51 hours post‐loading dose , mean SOWS score was 10.4 ( 9.7 ) . Mean ( SD ) POMS total mood disturbance ( TMD ) score was 53.8 ( 22.2 ) at baseline and declined to 37.3 ( 43.3 ) at 57 hours post‐loading dose . Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal , 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration ( mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose ) , 2 of whom withdrew from the study . All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores ( SOWS : 4.8 ( 4.9 ) at 81 h ; POMS TMD : 0.8 ( 4.6 ) at 84 h ) . Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment , largely devoid of support ; 5 subjects relapsed , 3 were lost to follow‐up , and 1 remained abstinent ( 15 weeks ) . Conclusions : Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated .

0.5mg / kg	6362	label infusion of ketamine ( 0.5mg / kg over 40 minutes ) ,	"Ketamine 's antidepressant efficacy is extended for at least four weeks in subjects with a family history of an alcohol use disorder.^ 
 BACKGROUND : A single subanesthetic infusion of the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid and potent antidepressant properties in treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( TRD ) . As a family history of an alcohol use disorder is a positive predictor of ketamine 's antidepressant response and the strength of the association increases over time , we hypothesized that depressed subjects with a family history of an alcohol use disorder would have greater antidepressant durability and that riluzole would augment and/or extend ketamine 's antidepressant efficacy . METHODS : Fifty - two TRD subjects received an open - label infusion of ketamine ( 0.5mg / kg over 40 minutes ) , and , four to six hours post - infusion , were randomized to either flexible - dose ( 100 - 200mg / day ) riluzole or placebo in the following proportions : Family History Positive ( FHP ) riluzole ( n = 10 ) , FHP placebo ( n = 9 ) , Family History Negative ( FHN ) riluzole ( n = 16 ) , and FHN placebo ( n = 17 ) . RESULTS : FHP subjects randomized to placebo had a greater antidepressant response than FHN subjects ; however , contrary to our initial hypothesis , there was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy with riluzole . Although potentially underpowered , there was no difference in overall time - to - relapse based on randomization status ( riluzole responders : n = 15 , placebo responders : n = 17 ) . Yet , time - to - relapse was longer in FHP placebo responders ( n = 8) compared to FHN placebo responders ( n = 9 ) with , again , no significant difference in time - to - relapse in FHP riluzole responders ( n = 6 ) compared to FHN riluzole responders ( n = 9 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine 's extended antidepressant durability in FHP TRD should be considered in the design and analysis of ketamine depression trials ."

 BACKGROUND : Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects . However , optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated . The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1 - minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg in treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . METHODS : Ten patients with TRD were included in an open , noncontrolled 4 - week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg . Main outcome measure was the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation . RESULTS : Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients , which all resolved without any intervention . Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40 - minute postinjection until day 15 . Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks . The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7 . Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks . CONCLUSIONS : This study suggests that in well - controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring , a single rapid 1 - minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD . These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD .

0.5 mg / kg	2605	weekly infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or the active comparator	"Ketamine Versus Midazolam for Depression Relapse Prevention Following Successful Electroconvulsive Therapy : A Randomized Controlled Pilot Trial.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Depression relapse after electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is common ( 40 % at 6 months ) . Ketamine has a robust antidepressant effect , but there are no reported studies of ketamine for depression relapse prevention . This pilot trial ( NCT02414932 ) was designed to assess feasibility of the proposed trial protocol , including examining reasons for nonrecruitment , nonrandomization , and dropout . METHODS : Patients with unipolar depression referred for ECT were monitored weekly for therapeutic response , using the 24 - item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression ( monitoring phase ) . Those who met standard response criteria were invited to be randomized to a course of 4 once - weekly infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or the active comparator , midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ) , over 40 minutes to examine trial processes ( treatment phase ) . Participants were followed up for 6 months after ECT to assess for relapse . RESULTS : One hundred seventy - five referrals were screened over 18 months , and 68 % of eligible participants ( n = 43 ) were recruited to the monitoring phase ; 60.5 % of participants met ECT response criteria ( n = 26 ) , but only 26 % ( 6 ) of these consented to take part in the treatment phase . These were randomized ( 3 to ketamine and 3 to midazolam ) , and no participant completed the 4 - week treatment protocol . Information was gathered on reasons for nonrecruitment , nonrandomization , and dropout , which included practical aspects of infusions and lack of interest in further treatment after response to ECT . CONCLUSIONS : The proposed treatment protocol is not suitable for a definitive trial in our center . Information collected on reasons for dropout may inform future clinical trials of intravenous ketamine . TRIAL REGISTRATION : www.clinicaltrials.gov NCT02414932 ."
0.5 mg / kg	2207	to receive either ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg 40 min ; N =	"Long term structural and functional neural changes following a single infusion of Ketamine in PTSD.^ 
 NMDA receptor antagonists have a vital role in extinction , learning , and reconsolidation processes . During the reconsolidation window , memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form . This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD . In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine , followed by brief exposure therapy , to enhance post - retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories . 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg 40 min ; N = 14 ) or midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ; N = 13 ) after retrieval of the traumatic memory . 24 h following infusion , participants received a four - day trauma - focused psychotherapy . Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment , at the end of treatment , and at 30 - day follow - up . Amygdala activation to trauma scripts ( a major biomarker of fear response ) served as the main study outcome . Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups , post - treatment , ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala ( -0.33 , sd = 0.13 , 95%HDI [ -0.56,-0.04 ] ) and hippocampus ( -0.3 ( sd = 0.19 ) , 95%HDI [ -0.65 , 0.04 ] ; marginal effect ) reactivation to trauma memories , compared to midazolam recipients . Post - retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus ( -0.28 , sd = 0.11 , 95%HDI [ -0.46 , -0.11 ] ) , with no change in amygdala - vmPFC connectivity . Moreover , reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi - lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients ( right : post - treatment : -0.01108 , 95 % HDI [ -0.0184,-0.003 ] ; follow - up : -0.0183 , 95 % HDI [ -0.02719,-0.0107 ] ; left : post - treatment : -0.019 , 95 % HDI [ -0.028,-0.011 ] ; follow - up : -0.017 , 95 % HDI [ -0.026,-0.007 ] ) . Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post - retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans . These preliminary findings show promising direction toward the capacity to rewrite human traumatic memories and modulate the fear response for at least 30 days post - extinction . When combined with psychotherapy for PTSD , further investigation of ketamine dose , timing of administration , and frequency of administration , is warranted ."

 BACKGROUND : The demands of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) change with experience . This report contains two studies designed to examine N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor contributions to the executive components of WCST performance . These aspects of WCST performance figure more prominently in the initial completion of this task than in subsequent task repetitions in healthy populations . METHODS : In the first study , healthy subjects ( n = 15 ) completed the WCST on two occasions separated by 1 week . In the second study , healthy subjects ( n = 22 ) completed two test days spaced by approximately 1 week , during which , they completed the WCST and other assessments after administration of the NMDA antagonist ketamine ( intravenous bolus 0.26 mg / kg followed by infusion of 0.65 mg / kg / hour ) or matched placebo . RESULTS : In the first study , subjects reduced the number of total and perseverative errors with a single repetition of the WCST . In the second study , ketamine significantly increased the number of total errors and the number and percent of perseverative errors on the first , but not the second test day . Similarly , it reduced the number of category criteria met on the first , but not second test day . Ketamine also increased distractibility , impaired recall , produced psychosis , altered perception , and had effects resembling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . However , only WCST performance showed order dependency . CONCLUSIONS : This order dependency further implicates NMDA receptors in executive cognitive functions associated with the frontal cortex ."

RESULTS : In the first study , subjects reduced the number of total and perseverative errors with a single repetition of the WCST . In the second study , ketamine significantly increased the number of total errors and the number and percent of perseverative errors on the first , but not the second test day . Similarly , it reduced the number of category criteria met on the first , but not second test day . Ketamine also increased distractibility , impaired recall , produced psychosis , altered perception , and had effects resembling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia . However , only WCST performance showed order dependency . CONCLUSIONS : This order dependency further implicates NMDA receptors in executive cognitive functions associated with the frontal cortex ."

0.5 to 1.25 mg / kg	5598	. Ketamine dosage varied from 0.5 to 1.25 mg / kg . The frequency of administration	"Oral ketamine for depression : An updated systematic review.^ 
 Objectives : Ketamine is a glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist that can be used to treat major depressive disorder by single or repeated infusions . However , the accessibility and scalability of oral ketamine make it preferred over intravenous ketamine . In this systematic review , we aim to evaluate the efficacy , tolerability , and safety of oral ketamine , esketamine and r - ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression . Materials and methods : Electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2022 to identify relevant articles . Results : Twenty - two studies , including four randomized clinical trials ( RCTs ) , one case series , six case reports , five open - label trials and six retrospective chart review studies involving 2336 patients with depression were included . All included studies reported significant improvement following ketamine administration . Ketamine was well tolerated without serious adverse events . However , RCTs had a high risk of bias due to analysis methods and adverse events monitoring . Ketamine dosage varied from 0.5 to 1.25 mg / kg . The frequency of administration was daily to monthly . Several important limitations were identified , most notably the small number of RCTs . Conclusions : Taken together , preliminary evidence suggests the potential for antidepressant effect of oral ketamine . However , further research with large sample size and long follow - up period is needed to better determine the antisuicidal effect and efficacy in treatment - resistant depression ."
5 - 15 µg	2118	schedule using a dose of 5 - 15 µg . Tolerability will be assessed	"An open - label pilot trial assessing tolerability and feasibility of LSD microdosing in patients with major depressive disorder ( LSDDEP1).^ 
 BACKGROUND : Globally , an estimated 260 million people suffer from depression [ 1 ] , and there is a clear need for the development of new , alternative antidepressant therapies . In light of problems with the tolerability and efficacy of available treatments [ 2 ] , a global trend is emerging for patients to self - treat depression with microdoses of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) and psilocybin [ 3 ] . Beyond anecdotal reports from those who self - medicate in this way , few clinical trials have evaluated this practice . In our recently published phase 1 study in healthy volunteers [ 4 ] , we determined that LSD microdosing was relatively safe and well tolerated in that cohort . Furthermore , the data demonstrated that conducting such microdosing trials is broadly feasible , with excellent adherence and compliance to the regimen observed . In this open - label pilot trial of patients with major depressive disorder ( LSDDEP1 ) , we will test the tolerability and feasibility of an 8 - week regimen of LSD microdosing in this patient group prior to a larger subsequent randomised controlled trial ( LSDDEP2 ) . METHODS : Twenty patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder will receive an 8 - week LSD microdosing treatment regimen . The treatment protocol will use a sublingual formulation of LSD ( MB-22001 ) delivered twice per week under a titration schedule using a dose of 5 - 15 µg . Tolerability will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of participants who withdraw from the trial due to adverse events attributable to the treatment regimen , while feasibility will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of attended clinic visits once enrolled . To determine whether there is any antidepressant response to the LSD microdosing regimen , MADRS scores will be assessed at baseline and 2 , 4 , 6 , and 8 weeks after the commencement of the regimen . DISCUSSION : The results of LSDDEP1 will provide valuable information regarding the tolerability and feasibility of a proposed LSD microdosing regimen in patients with MDD . Such information is critically important to optimise trial design prior to commencing a subsequent and more resource - intensive randomised controlled trial .

 BACKGROUND : A growing body of preclinical research suggests that brain glutamate systems may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants . This is the first placebo - controlled , double - blinded trial to assess the treatment effects of a single dose of an N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist in patients with depression . METHODS : Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride ( .5 mg / kg ) or saline solutions under randomized , double - blind conditions . RESULTS : Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion ( i.e. , mean 25 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 + /- SD 10 points vs. 0 + /- 12 points , respectively during active and sham treatment ) . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest a potential role for NMDA receptor - modulating drugs in the treatment of depression ."

 OBJECTIVE : The authors compared the efficacy of standard - of - care treatment plus intranasal esketamine or placebo for rapid reduction of symptoms of major depression , including suicidality , among individuals at imminent suicide risk . METHOD : In a double - blind , multicenter , proof - of - concept study , 68 participants were randomly assigned to receive esketamine ( 84 mg ) or placebo twice weekly for 4 weeks , in addition to comprehensive standard - of - care treatment . The primary efficacy endpoint was change in score from baseline to 4 hours after initial dose on the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Clinician global judgment of suicide risk ( from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool ) was also assessed . Secondary endpoints included these measures at 24 hours and double - blind endpoint at day 25 . RESULTS : A significantly greater improvement in MADRS score was observed in the esketamine group compared with the placebo group at 4 hours ( least - square mean difference=-5.3 , SE=2.10 ; effect size=0.61 ) and at ∼24 hours ( least - square mean difference=-7.2 , SE=2.85 ; effect size=0.65 ) , but not at day 25 ( least - square mean difference=-4.5 , SE=3.14 ; effect size=0.35 ) . Significantly greater improvement was also observed in the esketamine group on the MADRS suicidal thoughts item score at 4 hours ( effect size=0.67 ) , but not at 24 hours ( effect size=0.35 ) or at day 25 ( effect size=0.29 ) . Between - group reductions in clinician global judgment of suicide risk scores were not statistically different at any time point . The most common adverse events among participants in the esketamine group were nausea , dizziness , dissociation , unpleasant taste , and headache . CONCLUSIONS : These preliminary findings indicate that intranasal esketamine compared with placebo , given in addition to comprehensive standard - of - care treatment , may result in significantly rapid improvement in depressive symptoms , including some measures of suicidal ideation , among depressed patients at imminent risk for suicide ."

.5mg / kg	2232	infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( .5mg / kg ) over 40 min .	"Baseline delta sleep ratio predicts acute ketamine mood response in major depressive disorder.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Electroencephalographic ( EEG ) sleep slow wave activity ( SWA ; EEG power between 0.6 and 4Hz ) has been proposed as a marker of central synaptic plasticity . Decreased generation of sleep slow waves -- a core feature of sleep in depression -- indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease . Various measures of SWA have previously been used to predict antidepressant treatment response . This study examined the relationship between baseline patterns of SWA in the first two NREM episodes and antidepressant response to an acute infusion of the N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist ketamine . METHODS : Thirty patients ( 20 M , 10F , 18 - 65 ) fulfilling DSM - IV criteria for treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) who had been drug - free for two weeks received a single open - label infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( .5mg / kg ) over 40 min . Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) before and after ketamine infusion . Sleep recordings were obtained the night before the infusion and were visually scored . SWA was computed for individual artifact - free NREM sleep epochs , and averaged for each NREM episode . Delta sleep ratio ( DSR ) was calculated as SWA(NREM1)/SWA(NREM2 ) . RESULTS : A significant positive correlation was observed between baseline DSR and reduced MADRS scores from baseline to Day 1 ( r=.414 , p=.02 ) . LIMITATIONS : The sample size was relatively small ( N=30 ) and all subjects had treatment - resistant MDD , which may limit the generalizability of the findings . Further studies are needed to replicate and extend this observation to other patient groups . CONCLUSIONS : DSR may be a useful baseline predictor of ketamine response in individuals with treatment - resistant MDD ."

0.5 mg / kg	3820	single infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) from	"Effect of baseline anxious depression on initial and sustained antidepressant response to ketamine.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Patients with anxious depression are typically more difficult to treat with monoaminergic antidepressants compared to those with nonanxious depression . Although novel research has shown that the N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapidly acting , relatively sustained effects in treating depression , we predicted that , consistent with the existent literature on traditional antidepressants , patients with anxious depression would have a poorer antidepressant response . METHOD : Twenty - six inpatients with treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( MDD ) ( DSM - IV criteria ) received a single infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) from January 2006 - March 2013 and were followed for 28 days . A post hoc analysis compared treatment response and relapse using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) in patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression . Anxious depression was defined as MDD plus a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale anxiety / somatization factor score ≥ 7 . RESULTS : Both anxious and nonanxious depressed patients responded positively to ketamine . A linear mixed model controlling for baseline with the MADRS revealed a significant group main effect ( P = .03 ) and group - by - time interaction ( P = .01 ) . Post hoc tests indicated that patients with anxious depression had significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to those with nonanxious depression at days 1 through 5 , 9 through 12 , 15 through 17 , and 25 , with no significant group differences in dissociative ( P = .62 ) or psychotic ( P = .41 ) side effects . Regarding responders , patients with anxious depression relapsed significantly later than those with nonanxious depression ( median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 0.0 days to relapse , respectively ; χ² = 9.30 ; P = .002 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Unexpectedly , patients with anxious depression responded better to ketamine than those with nonanxious depression , with longer time to relapse and no side effect differences . This finding gives promise for the role of novel glutamatergic medications for the treatment of those with anxious depression , a traditionally difficult - to - treat subgroup of depressed patients .

 The feasibility of intravenous ketamine administration during the perioperative period of cesarean section to prevent postpartum depression ( PPD ) has not been determined by meta - analysis . To evaluate the efficacy , safety and dose of prophylactic ketamine in offsetting PPD , we retrieved the following databases in English or Chinese from inception to December 2020 : Pubmed , Embase , Web of Science , The Cochrane Library , CNKI , VIP and Wanfang . A total of 10 studies ( 9 RCTs and 1 retrospective study ) were included with 2087 cases . Meta - analysis showed that in ketamine group , the score and the prevalence of PPD within 1 week postpartum were significantly reduced , whereas PPD score after 4 weeks postpartum showed no superiority . There was no significant difference in terms of total adverse events rate , although vomiting occurred more frequently in the ketamine group . In addition , we found that ketamine efficacy emerged at 0.5 mg / kg . By meta - regression , we observed that : ( 1 ) Age and BMI are negatively associated with mood response to ketamine . ( 2 ) An analgesic pump containing ketamine for continuous 48 h postpartum administration was more efficacious than an intravenous injection of ketamine during cesarean section .

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low - dose ketamine / midazolam on anxiety , analgesia , amnesia and subjective feelings . METHODS . 140 out - patients ( ASA I ) were randomly divided into four groups . The double - blind study was prospective . CONTROL GROUP : Local anaesthesia ( LA ) , articaine 4 % plus epinephrine 1:200,000 ( n = 35 ) ; test group P / M : LA , additional pentazocine 0.40 mg / kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg / kg bw i.v .

( n = 35 ) , test group K50 / M : LA , additionally ketamine 0.5 mg / kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg / kg bw i.v . ( n = 35 ) . LA was injected 3 min after application of the systemic medication in the test groups or application of a placebo ( saline 0.9 % ) in the control group . Three further minutes later , operation was started . For evaluation questionnaires , visual analogue scales ( VAS ) and the state - trait anxiety inventory ( STAI ) were used . For testing retrograde and anterograde amnesia , acoustic sensations were delivered before application of the systemic medication ( a Christmas carol ) and during operation ( the German national anthem ) . RESULTS . The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data , duration of operation , applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation . The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild , in contrast to the control group . Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups . Retrograde amnesia was not found in any group . Complete anterograde amnesia was observed in all test groups with respect to the intraoperative sensation , but even in the control group 50 % of the patients did not remember having heard the national anthem .

84 mg	5968	were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice	"Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder : a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^ 
 Background : ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed , global , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies ( NCT03039192 , NCT03097133 ) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine ( ESK ) nasal spray vs placebo ( PBO ) nasal spray , given in the context of comprehensive standard of care ( SoC ; ie , hospitalization , initiation , or optimization of antidepressant therapy ) , in adults with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) who had active suicidal ideation with intent . These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior . To further understand the rapid effect of ESK + SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline , we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised ( CGI‐SS‐r ) scores after ESK treatment . Methods : The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of > 28 at baseline . Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks . For this post hoc analysis , a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score > 34 ( Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986 ) . Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose , 24 hours post‐first dose , and predose on day 25 ( ie , last day of double‐blind treatment phase ) . Differences between least squares mean ( LSM ) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures . Percentages of subjects achieving response ( ie , change in MADRS total score ≥50 % ) and remission ( ie , MADRS total score ≤12 ) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests . Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r ( ≥1‐point decrease ) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out . Results : Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials , 370 ( 82.2 % ) had severe MDD at baseline , as defined by MADRS score , and were included in this post hoc analysis ( n=189 , ESK+SoC ; n=181 , PBO + SoC ) . Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline ( mean age : 40.3 ; 61.4 % female ) . Mean ( SD ) MADRS total scores were 41.9 ( 4.62 ) and 42.5 ( 4.64 ) , respectively . The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose ( ‐12.6 vs ‐8.6 ; LSM difference [ 95 % CI ] ‐4.0 [ ‐5.9 , ‐2.1 ] ; P<0.001 ) , at 24 hourspost‐first dose ( ‐16.4 vs ‐11.7 ; LSM difference [ 95 % CI ] ‐4.7 [ ‐6.9 , ‐2.5 ] ; P<0.001 ) , and on day 25 ( ‐26.0 vs ‐22.8 ; LSM difference [ 95 % CI ] ‐3.2 [ ‐5.8 , ‐0.7 ] ; P=0.013 ) . Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose ( 24.5 % vs 11.1 % ; P<0.001 ) , at 24 hours post‐first dose ( 34.8 % vs 22.4 % ; P=0.009 ) , and on day 25 ( 76.7 % vs 58.3 % ; P<0.001 ) . The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose ( 8.5 % vs 2.8 % ; P=0.017 ) , at 24 hours post‐first dose ( 18.2 % vs 6.7 % ; P<0.001 ) , and on day 25 ( 51.3 % vs 36.1 % ; P=0.008 ) . Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78 % more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose ( odds ratio [ 95 % CI ] 1.78 [ 1.15 , 2.74 ] ; P=0.009 ) and 99 % more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose ( odds ratio [ 95 % CI ] 199 [ 1.24 , 3.20 ] ; P=0.005 ] than patients in the PBO+SoC group . Conclusions : Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent , patients with severe MDD , as defined by MADRS total score > 34 , demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK + SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose . Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase . Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments . ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression . Reference : Snaith RP et al .

 One of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence . We propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation . Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions , psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance ( Griffiths et al . , 2006 , 2008 ) . It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent . Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine , heroin , or alcohol . More specifically , we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine‐dependent cigarette smokers , who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts , and who continue to desire to quit smoking . Other than nicotine dependence , participants will be healthy . Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open‐label pilot‐study with no control condition . Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin ( n=40 ) , or nicotine patch ( n=40 ) treatment . Participants will receive a 13‐week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation , with Target Quit Date set for week 5 . After several preparation meetings with study monitors , participants will have either a single day‐long psilocybin session using a high dose ( 30 mg/70 kg ) , or a standard 8 to 10‐week course of nicotine patch treatment . Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date , including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples . Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3 , 6 , and 12 months after the Target Quit Date . Additionally , 50 of these participants ( 25 per treatment condition ) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain‐based mechanisms associated with these treatments . Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin session after completing the 6‐month follow‐up meeting ."

 PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person 's daily life . PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war , disaster , sexual abuse , violence , terrorism , and accidents . PTSD negatively impacts a person 's daily life , resulting in relationship difficulties , difficulty in finding and maintaining a job , reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning , substance abuse , high‐cost healthcare use , and increased depression and suicide risk . Available PTSD treatments , including medications and therapy , effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration .

1 mg / kg	8606	- month maintenance phase of 1 mg / kg ketamine dosed once or twice	"Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine , as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment - resistant obsessive compulsive , post - traumatic stress , generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders . OBJECTIVES : This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire ( FQ ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory ( SSAI ) . METHODS : This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open - label and double - blinded placebo - controlled study . A total of 24 patients received short - term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3 - month maintenance phase of 1 mg / kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly . FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between - dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance . RESULTS : Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose - related reduction in all three FQ subscales ( agoraphobia , social phobia and blood - injury phobia ) and in the SSAI . A progressive decrease in pre - dose rating - scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy . CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine demonstrated dose - related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI . Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment - resistant anxiety . Furthermore , ketamine appears to have broad , dose - related anti - phobic effects . These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states , such as specific phobia ."

Outcome measures included subjective , autonomic , and adverse effects , pharmacokinetics of DMT , and plasma levels of brain - derived neurotropic factor ( BDNF ) and oxytocin . Low ( 15 mg ) and high ( 25 mg ) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min . DMT infusions ( 0.6 or 1 mg / min ) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose - dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min . Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions . After stopping the infusion , all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min , consistent with a short early plasma elimination half - life ( t(1/2α ) ) of 5.0 - 5.8 min , followed by longer late elimination ( t(1/2β ) = 14 - 16 min ) after 15 - 20 min . Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min , despite further increasing plasma concentrations , thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration .

Methods : Midazolam 0.02 mg / kg was administered to all patients as premedication . Patients were randomly allocated in one of the following groups : Ketamine group and Control group . All patients received spinal anesthesia . Both groups received systemic i.v . analgesia with morphine 0.15 mg / kg plus ketoprophene 300 mg by elastomeric infusion pump at the rate of 2 ml / h for 24 h. The planned rescue analgesia was i.v . boluses of 2 mg of Morphine in order to obtain a VAS score ≤3 . All patients received paracetamol every 6 h and , after systemic morphine discontinuation , oxycodone 5 mg SR 1 tablet every 12 h. In the Ketamine group a bolus of 0.15 mg / kg of ketamine was given to the patients before the start of operation then an infusion of 0.2 mg / kg / h was maintained until the end of the operation . In all patients the level of sedation and any appearance of unpleasant psychotomimetic manifestations were recorded using Ramsay Sedation Scale during the surgical procedure . Postoperative pain score was evaluated using VAS scale at rest and during mobilization at 2‐4‐8‐12‐24‐48‐72 h after surgery . Rescue morphine requirement as well as incidences of adverse events were recorded at the same postoperative intervals . The length of hospital stay ( LOS ) and patient satisfaction were investigated in both groups . Results : Seventeen eligible patients completed the study protocol from April to June 2011 . A significant reduction in post‐operative pain score at rest and during patient mobilization , was observed in Ketamine group ( P < 0.05 ) , especially after 72 h ( P < 0.01 ) . No patients experienced psychotomimetic adverse effects ( Ramsay Sedation Scale 2 ) . Opioid requirement was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . LOS was significantly shorter in Ketamine group ( P < 0.01 ) . Conclusions : Preliminary results showed that , in the multimodal analgesic regime , the perioperative administration of i.v . sub‐anesthetic doses of ketamine provides opioid‐sparing effects , improves the quality of postoperative analgesia and accelerates patient recovery after THA surgery ."

 The present study is part of a research program designed to better understand the neurochemical mechanisms underlying the abuse liability of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) in humans . In these studies , MDMA will be compared to prototypical dopamine ( D - amphetamine ) and serotonin ( meta - chlorophenylpiperazine , mCPP ) releasing agents on a variety of measures related to dependence . In order to determine an acceptable dose range ( safe but active ) of MDMA and mCPP for these studies , moderate MDMA users were administered escalating doses of MDMA ( 75 , 110 and 145 mg/70 kg ) and mCPP ( 17.5 , 35 and 52.5 mg/70 kg ) . Each participant received a single dose under controlled laboratory conditions , i.e. this was a six - group design with a separate group for each dose . There were five participants tested in each group . MDMA increased blood pressure and heart rate whereas mCPP had no effect on these physiological measures . MDMA produced increases in subjective effects indicative of both stimulant ( increases in POMS Elation , ARCI Amphetamine , VAS High and Stimulated scale scores ) and hallucinogenic effects ( increases on five of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale ) . mCPP produced similar stimulant effects ( e.g. increases on POMS Elation , VAS High and Stimulated ) , as well as hallucinogenic effects ( four of the six scales of the Hallucinogenic Rating Scale ) , which has not been observed in previous studies ."

0.5mg / kg	2556	sub - anesthetic dose ( 0.5mg / kg ) of ketamine infused IV	"Low - dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Recent studies demonstrating a rapid , robust improvement in treatment resistant depression ( TRD ) following a single sub - anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement . However , these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity , concurrent medication , and level of suicide risk . This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub - anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real - world TRD treatment program within a major university health system . METHODS : The effects of a sub - anesthetic dose ( 0.5mg / kg ) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California , San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder ( MDD ) or Bipolar Disorder ( BD ) . RESULTS : Subjects were aged 48.6 , 78 % white , 36.6 % female , and 82.9 % had MDD . Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73 % . Average pre - infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 ( S.D ) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24 - h post - infusion ( p < 0.001 ) . The 24 - h response ( ≥ 50 % reduction from pre - infusion ) and remission ( BDI < 13 ) rates were 53.7 % and 41.5 % , respectively . Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7 - days . Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion . LIMITATIONS : Retrospective nature of this study , lack of control group and use of self - report depression ratings scales . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first published study of sub - anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real - world TRD population . The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population ."

 RATIONALE : Although both psilocybin and dextromethorphan ( DXM ) produce psychedelic - like subjective effects , rates of non - medical use of psilocybin are consistently greater than DXM . OBJECTIVE : New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non - medical use . METHODS : Single , acute oral doses of psilocybin ( 10 , 20 , 30 mg/70 kg ) , DXM ( 400 mg/70 kg ) , and placebo were administered under double - blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use . RESULTS : High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength . Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin : liking , visual effects , positive mood , insight , positive social effects , increased awareness of beauty ( both visual and music ) , awe / amazement , meaningfulness , and mystical experience . For most ratings , ( 1 ) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo ; ( 2 ) psilocybin showed dose - related increases ; 3 , DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin ; ( 4 ) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM . These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again . CONCLUSIONS : This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects ( alternatively described as the "" motivation "" to use ) . Observed differences on these domains between psilocybin and DXM are consistent with the relative rates of non - medical use of psilocybin and DXM ."
0.5 mg / kg	7903	assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg / kg intravenous ketamine on task -	"Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^ 
 At subanaesthetic doses , ketamine , an N - methyl - d - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment - resistant depression . The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood , with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high - frequency oscillatory power ( Wood et al . , 2012 ) noted in animal studies . Here we used magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) in a single blind , crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg / kg intravenous ketamine on task - related high - frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices . Consistent with animal findings , ketamine increased beta amplitudes , decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma - band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices . The amplification of gamma - band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition . This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans , which may underlie the anti - depressant actions of ketamine .

 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : Ketamine may work as an anti - inflammatory agent , and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) in patients with treatment - resistant depression . However , whether genes related to pro - inflammatory and anti - inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown . Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low - dose ketamine in patients with treatment - resistant depression . METHODS : Based on the genome data from our clinical trial , this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms . In total , 65 patients with treatment - resistant depression ( n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg / kg , 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg / kg , and 24 for normal saline ) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms . Genes associated with 80 cytokines ( i.e. , interleukin [ IL]-1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - α , and adiponectin ) and VEGF ( i.e. , VEGF and VEGF receptors ) were selected for the gene - based genome - wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion . RESULTS : Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms , including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC , were related to the rapid ( within 240 min ) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion ; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms , such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353 , rs8179353 , and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8 , were associated with the sustained ( up to 2 weeks ) antidepressant effect of low - dose ( combined 0.5 mg / kg and 0.2 mg / kg ) ketamine . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti - inflammatory and pro - inflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - α , C - reactive protein , and adiponectin ) and VEGF - FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment - resistant depression .

Genes associated with 80 cytokines ( i.e. , interleukin [ IL]-1 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - α , and adiponectin ) and VEGF ( i.e. , VEGF and VEGF receptors ) were selected for the gene - based genome - wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion . RESULTS : Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms , including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC , were related to the rapid ( within 240 min ) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion ; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms , such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353 , rs8179353 , and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8 , were associated with the sustained ( up to 2 weeks ) antidepressant effect of low - dose ( combined 0.5 mg / kg and 0.2 mg / kg ) ketamine . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti - inflammatory and pro - inflammatory cytokines ( i.e. , IL-1 , IL-2 , IL-6 , tumor necrosis factor - α , C - reactive protein , and adiponectin ) and VEGF - FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment - resistant depression . The synergic modulation of inflammatory and VEGF systems may contribute to the antidepressant effect of ketamine .

100 mg	5738	single dose of MDMA ( 100 mg ) or placebo ( Study	"The Effects of MDMA and Methamphetamine on Feelings of Closeness and Connection During Semi - Structured Conversations With Strangers.^ 
 Background : MDMA is classified as an “ empathogenic ” drug , as it increases feelings of empathy and closeness to others . These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission . Despite its prosocial effects , few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions . The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi‐structured dyadic conversation , and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels . To investigate pharmacological specificity , a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine . Methods : Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers . In within‐subject , double‐blind , placebocontrolled designs , subjects aged 18‐35 received a single dose of MDMA ( 100 mg ) or placebo ( Study 1 ; n = 18 ) , or a single dose of methamphetamine ( 20 mg ) or placebo ( Study 2 ; n = 19 ) , during two in‐lab sessions separated by 72 hours . During peak drug effect , they engaged in a 45 min semi‐structured conversation with a novel same‐sex partner . Subjective mood , physiological , and oxytocin levels were obtained at regular intervals , and subjects rated feelings of closeness and connection with their partners at the end of each session and one week later . Results : Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased ratings of feeling connected to the partner , and increased ratings of enjoyment and meaningfulness of the conversation , relative to placebo ( Study 1 MDMA ; p=0.009 and Study 2 methamphetamine p=0.01 ) . Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased subjective ratings of “ sociable , ” “ loving , ” and “ friendly . ” Only MDMA increased ratings of “ trusting , ” “ grateful , ” and “ appreciated , ” and only methamphetamine increased ratings of “ understood ” MDMA ( p=0.001 ) , and to a lesser extent methamphetamine ( p=0.02 ) increased salivary oxytocin levels . Notably , oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine ( Study 1 ; r=0.52 , p=0.03 ) . Conclusions : Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions , and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability . However , these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA , suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs . This study provides a model for future studies assessing effects of drugs on interpersonal interactions ."
0.5 mg / kg	7945	dose of intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) in the acute medical	"Ketamine Infusion After Suicide Attempt : new Frontiers in Treating Acute Suicidality in a “ real world ” Medical Setting.^ 
 Background / Significance : Suicide is a devastating public health crisis with few available treatments which quickly reduce the intensity of suicidality . In controlled , outpatient research settings , ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts as early as 2‐24 hours after a single infusion in patients with high suicide risk ( Price 2014 ) ( Murrough 2015 ) . In this IRB approved pilot study , we investigated ketamine ’s effects on suicidality in a real‐world sample of recent suicide attempters at imminent risk of suicide on a tertiary‐care Consultation‐Liaison ( CL ) psychiatry service . Through administration of a “ pre‐treatment ” prior to psychiatric hospital transfer , we hypothesized ketamine would rapidly impact suicidal ideation in patients who attempted suicide and synergistically confer enduring benefits to behavioral therapies . Methods : In an open‐label design , we recruited 16 transdiagnostic patients,18‐65 years old to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) in the acute medical setting , after CL consultation and informed consent . All were psychiatrically hospitalized post‐infusion . Baseline suicidality and depression measures [ Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale , Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale , Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire , hopelessness ( via Cognitive Triad Inventory ) ] were compared to 24‐hours , 5‐days , 12‐days , and 1‐ and 3‐months post‐infusion using paired t‐tests . Results : Across all measures , rapid , statistically significant decreases ( p’s<.001 ) were observed with large to very large effect sizes ( Cohen ’s d ’s : 1.7‐8.8 ) at acute timepoints ( 24‐hour ; 5‐day ) . These large gains were also uniformly maintained during follow‐up , continuously out to 3‐months post‐infusion . Discussion : Ketamine rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra‐high‐risk , heterogeneous , “ real world ” sample . Combined with standard care , ketamine might also synergistically enhance the durability of benefit observed following discharge , consistent with a growing literature examining ketamine as a pre‐treatment to behavioral therapies ( Dakwar 2020 ) . In forthcoming analyses , we will compare 6‐ and 12‐month rates of suicide re‐attempt and re‐hospitalization in ketamine‐treated patients to a matched case‐control sample of suicide attempters who did not receive ketamine pre‐treatment . Conclusion / Implications : Ketamine infusion is a safe , feasible , and viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among patients admitted to the medical hospital after suicide attempt , and could also have enduring benefits . By advancing knowledge of novel treatment methods in real‐world clinical services through completion of further studies , ketamine could become an important and novel tool in the treatment of high‐risk CL patients .

The MDMA - alcohol combination induced longer lasting euphoria and well being than MDMA or alcohol alone . MDMA reversed the subjective sedation induced by alcohol but did not reduce drunkenness feelings . MDMA did not reverse the actions of alcohol on psychomotor abilities . Combined use of MDMA and alcohol causes dissociation between subjective and objective sedation . Subjects may feel euphoric and less sedated and might have the feeling of doing better , but actual performance ability continues to be impaired by the effect of alcohol . Confirmation of these findings in further studies will be highly relevant in terms of road safety ."

 BACKGROUND : Postpartum depression ( PPD ) is a common complication of cesarean section . S - ketamine given intravenously during surgery can help prevent PPD . However , whether S - ketamine in patient - controlled intravenous analgesia ( PCIA ) can reduce the incidence of PPD is unknown . This study assessed the effect of S - ketamine as an adjuvant in PCIA for preventing PPD in women undergoing cesarean delivery . METHODS : A total of 375 parturients scheduled to undergo cesarean section and then receive PCIA were recruited from a single center and were randomly assigned to control ( C ) group ( sufentanil 2 μg / kg + tropisetron 10 mg ) or S - ketamine ( S ) group ( S - ketamine 0.5 mg / kg + sufentanil 2 μg / kg + tropisetron 10 mg ) . The primary outcome was the incidence of PPD measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale ( EPDS ) after surgery . The secondary outcomes were EPDS scores , visual analog scale ( VAS ) scores , Ramsay sedation scale ( RSS ) scores , and the rate of adverse events , including headache , nausea , dizziness , drowsiness , and vomit . RESULTS : A total of 275 puerperal women were included in the study . The rate of depression in parturient on postoperative days 3 , 14 , 28 in the C group and S group were 17.6 and 8.2 % ( p < 0.05 ) , 24.2 and 9.8 % ( p < 0.05 ) , and 19.0 and 17.2 % ( p = 0.76 ) respectively . EPDS scores in the C group and S group on postoperative days 3,14 , and 28 were 7.65 ± 3.14 and 6.00 ± 2.47 ( p < 0.05 ) , 7.62 ± 3.14 and 6.38 ± 2.67 ( p < 0.05 ) , and 7.35 ± 3.17 and 6.90 ± 2.78 ( p = 0.15 ) , respectively .

 Background : The resurgence of interest in therapeutic use of psychedelic drugs has raised interest in microdosing of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) . There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses , taken at 3‐4‐ day intervals , improve mood and cognition . However , these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions . Methods : We conducted a double‐blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD ( 13 or 26 μg ) or placebo , in healthy adults . Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo ( N = 18 ) , 13 μg LSD ( N = 19 ) , or 26 μg LSD(N = 19 ) during four 5‐hour laboratory sessions , separated by 3‐4 days . They also attended by a drug‐free followup session 3‐4 days after their last session . We assessed mood and subjective states , cognitive and emotional function , and cardiovascular function during the drug sessions and at followup . Results : LSD produced small increases in ratings of ' feeling a drug effect ' , including both stimulant‐like and LSD‐like effects , especially during the first administration of the drug . The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure , and no residual effects were detected on the drug‐free followup session . Conclusions : We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies , but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition . Future studies are needed with larger sample sizes , longer duration of dosing , additional measures of cognitive or affective function , and with participants who exhibit clinical symptoms of anxiety and depression ."

 Background : Preclinical research has demonstrated that psychedelic substances from different structural classes such as 2,5‐ dimethoxy‐4‐iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , N , N‐dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) , and psilocybin affect neuroplasticity after acute and chronic administration . While , these effects were similar across psychedelic classes and the dissociative ketamine , LSD was most potent . Additional experiments with DMT also showed these morphological changes , even after the administration of low DMT doses that are considered to be sub‐hallucinogenic . The latter is important in light of the increased scientific interest in using low psychedelic doses , also known as ' microdosing ' . Despite preclinical evidence for psychedelic‐induced neuroplasticity , confirmation in humans is grossly lacking . Given the interest in brain‐derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) as a key player in several neurodegenerative andneuropsychiatric disorders , and the preclinical data showing psychedelics‐induced neuroplasticity , even in low doses of psychedelics , the present , double‐blind placebo‐controlled , within‐subjects study aimed to investigate whether LSD in low doses ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg ) affects BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers . Methods : Participants were recreational psychedelic users ( N=24 , both sexes ) who provided informed consent , fell within the inclusion criteria , and passed medical screening including standard blood chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis , prior to inclusion . Test days were scheduled with minimally five days in between . LSD ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg LSD base , dissolved in 96 % Vol ethanol ) or placebo ( 1 mL of ethanol ) was administered orally in the morning ( 10:00 AM ) . Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six‐hour period , and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA . Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data . Four trapezoidal areas under the curve ( AUC ) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo . The study adhered to the code of ethics on human experimentation , it was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and Maastricht University , and registered in the Dutch Clinical Trial register ( number : NTR7102 https://www.trialregister.nl/ ) . A permit for obtaining , storing , and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration . Complete within‐subjects cases ( N(5 mcg)=10 ; N(10 mcg)= 9 ; N ( 20 mcg)=8 ) entered statistical analyses . Non‐parametric Wilcoxon signed‐rank ( S‐R ) tests for related samples ( placebo versus LSD dose ) were conducted on BDNF AUC 's , and on BDNF plasma levels at ‐0.5h , +2h , +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5 , 10 and 20 mcg LSD . Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo . In case of a main effect Dunn 's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h , 4h , and 6h , 2h‐4h , and 4h‐6h were conducted . Effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05 . The alpha level was corrected for multiple comparisons with sequential Bonferroni in case of Dunn 's tests . Results : Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank ( S‐R ) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 ( Z= ‐2.60 , p= 0.009 , r= 0.58 , 95 % CI [ 0.11‐1.06 ] ) and 20 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) compared to placebo ; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant ( Z= ‐1.01 , p=0.31 ) . Wilcoxon S‐R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 ( Z= ‐2.80 , p < 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.15‐1.11 ] ) and 10 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐1.95 , p= 0.05 , r= 0.46 , 95 % [ ‐0.04‐0.97 ] ) compared to placebo . The latter CI included zero , indicating non‐significance . Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 ( Z= ‐2.29 , p= 0.02 , = 0.51 , 95 % CI [ 0.03‐0.99 ] ) and 20 mcg ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) LSD compared to placebo . Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame . BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD ( 8.95 ng / mL ) , and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg ( 8.28 ng / mL ) and 20 mcg of LSD ( 11 49 ng / mL ) . Conclusions : This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration , suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations . This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca ( containing the psychedelic DMT ) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose , compared to placebo , which was related to fast antidepressant actions . Besides emphasizing the need to sample BDNF beyond the elimination stage , in addition to including behavioral and/or imaging measures , future studies could focus on similarities between underlying biological pathways of the well‐studied ketamine , and LSD , as it will contribute to understanding the scope of effects LSD , might have , based on ketamine findings ."

Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six‐hour period , and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA . Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data . Four trapezoidal areas under the curve ( AUC ) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo .

Complete within‐subjects cases ( N(5 mcg)=10 ; N(10 mcg)= 9 ; N ( 20 mcg)=8 ) entered statistical analyses . Non‐parametric Wilcoxon signed‐rank ( S‐R ) tests for related samples ( placebo versus LSD dose ) were conducted on BDNF AUC 's , and on BDNF plasma levels at ‐0.5h , +2h , +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5 , 10 and 20 mcg LSD . Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo . In case of a main effect Dunn 's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h , 4h , and 6h , 2h‐4h , and 4h‐6h were conducted . Effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05 .

Results : Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank ( S‐R ) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 ( Z= ‐2.60 , p= 0.009 , r= 0.58 , 95 % CI [ 0.11‐1.06 ] ) and 20 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) compared to placebo ; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant ( Z= ‐1.01 , p=0.31 ) . Wilcoxon S‐R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 ( Z= ‐2.80 , p < 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.15‐1.11 ] ) and 10 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐1.95 , p= 0.05 , r= 0.46 , 95 % [ ‐0.04‐0.97 ] ) compared to placebo .

Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 ( Z= ‐2.29 , p= 0.02 , = 0.51 , 95 % CI [ 0.03‐0.99 ] ) and 20 mcg ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) LSD compared to placebo . Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame . BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD ( 8.95 ng / mL ) , and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg ( 8.28 ng / mL ) and 20 mcg of LSD ( 11 49 ng / mL ) . Conclusions : This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration , suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations . This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca ( containing the psychedelic DMT ) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose , compared to placebo , which was related to fast antidepressant actions .

Results : Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank ( S‐R ) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 ( Z= ‐2.60 , p= 0.009 , r= 0.58 , 95 % CI [ 0.11‐1.06 ] ) and 20 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) compared to placebo ; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant ( Z= ‐1.01 , p=0.31 ) . Wilcoxon S‐R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 ( Z= ‐2.80 , p < 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.15‐1.11 ] ) and 10 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐1.95 , p= 0.05 , r= 0.46 , 95 % [ ‐0.04‐0.97 ] ) compared to placebo . The latter CI included zero , indicating non‐significance . Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 ( Z= ‐2.29 , p= 0.02 , = 0.51 , 95 % CI [ 0.03‐0.99 ] ) and 20 mcg ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) LSD compared to placebo . Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame . BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD ( 8.95 ng / mL ) , and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg ( 8.28 ng / mL ) and 20 mcg of LSD ( 11 49 ng / mL ) . Conclusions : This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration , suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations . This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca ( containing the psychedelic DMT ) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose , compared to placebo , which was related to fast antidepressant actions .

20 mcg	3765	ng / mL ) and 20 mcg of LSD ( 11 49	"Low doses of lsd acutely increase bdnf blood plasma levels in healthy volunteers : preliminary findings.^ 
 Background : Preclinical research has demonstrated that psychedelic substances from different structural classes such as 2,5‐ dimethoxy‐4‐iodoamphetamine ( DOI ) , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , N , N‐dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) , and psilocybin affect neuroplasticity after acute and chronic administration . While , these effects were similar across psychedelic classes and the dissociative ketamine , LSD was most potent . Additional experiments with DMT also showed these morphological changes , even after the administration of low DMT doses that are considered to be sub‐hallucinogenic . The latter is important in light of the increased scientific interest in using low psychedelic doses , also known as ' microdosing ' . Despite preclinical evidence for psychedelic‐induced neuroplasticity , confirmation in humans is grossly lacking . Given the interest in brain‐derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) as a key player in several neurodegenerative andneuropsychiatric disorders , and the preclinical data showing psychedelics‐induced neuroplasticity , even in low doses of psychedelics , the present , double‐blind placebo‐controlled , within‐subjects study aimed to investigate whether LSD in low doses ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg ) affects BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers . Methods : Participants were recreational psychedelic users ( N=24 , both sexes ) who provided informed consent , fell within the inclusion criteria , and passed medical screening including standard blood chemistry , hematology , and urinalysis , prior to inclusion . Test days were scheduled with minimally five days in between . LSD ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg LSD base , dissolved in 96 % Vol ethanol ) or placebo ( 1 mL of ethanol ) was administered orally in the morning ( 10:00 AM ) . Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six‐hour period , and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA . Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data . Four trapezoidal areas under the curve ( AUC ) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo . The study adhered to the code of ethics on human experimentation , it was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and Maastricht University , and registered in the Dutch Clinical Trial register ( number : NTR7102 https://www.trialregister.nl/ ) . A permit for obtaining , storing , and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration . Complete within‐subjects cases ( N(5 mcg)=10 ; N(10 mcg)= 9 ; N ( 20 mcg)=8 ) entered statistical analyses . Non‐parametric Wilcoxon signed‐rank ( S‐R ) tests for related samples ( placebo versus LSD dose ) were conducted on BDNF AUC 's , and on BDNF plasma levels at ‐0.5h , +2h , +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5 , 10 and 20 mcg LSD . Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo . In case of a main effect Dunn 's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h , 4h , and 6h , 2h‐4h , and 4h‐6h were conducted . Effect sizes and 95 % confidence intervals ( 95 % CI ) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05 . The alpha level was corrected for multiple comparisons with sequential Bonferroni in case of Dunn 's tests . Results : Wilcoxon Signed‐Rank ( S‐R ) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 ( Z= ‐2.60 , p= 0.009 , r= 0.58 , 95 % CI [ 0.11‐1.06 ] ) and 20 mcg LSD ( Z= ‐2.52 , p= 0.01 , r= 0.63 , 95 % CI [ 0.09‐1.17 ] ) compared to placebo ; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant ( Z= ‐1.01 , p=0.31 ) .

The latter CI included zero , indicating non‐significance .

 BACKGROUND : Several recent trials indicate low - dose ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects . However , uncertainty remains in several areas : dose response , consistency across patient groups , effects on suicidality , and possible biases arising from crossover trials . METHODS : A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized trials in Medline , Embase , and PsycINFO databases up to August 2014 . The primary endpoints were change in depression scale scores at days 1 , 3 and 7 , remission , response , suicidality , safety , and tolerability . Data were independently abstracted by 2 reviewers . Where possible , unpublished data were obtained on treatment effects in the first period of crossover trials . RESULTS : Nine trials were identified , including 201 patients ( 52 % female , mean age 46 years ) . Six trials assessed low - dose ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg i.v . ) and 3 tested very low - dose ketamine ( one trial assessed 50 mg intra - nasal spray , another assessed 0.1 - 0.4 mg / kg i.v . , and another assessed 0.1 - 0.5 mg / kg i.v . , intramuscular , or s.c . ) . At day 3 , the reduction in depression severity score was less marked in the very low - dose trials ( P homogeneity < .05 ) and among bipolar patients . In analyses excluding the second period of crossover trials , response rates at day 7 were increased with ketamine ( relative risk 3.4 , 95 % CI 1.6 - 7.1 , P=.001 ) , as were remission rates ( relative risk 2.6 , CI 1.2 - 5.7 , P=.02 ) . The absolute benefits were large , with day 7 remission rates of 24 % vs 6 % ( P=.02 ) . Seven trials provided unpublished data on suicidality item scores , which were reduced on days 1 and 3 ( both P<.01 ) but not day 7 . CONCLUSION : Low - dose ketamine appears more effective than very low dose . There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical response , with remission among one - fifth of patients at 1 week but most others having benefits that are less durable .

 OBJECTIVES : Ketamine offers a plausible mechanism with favorable kinetics in treatment of severe ethanol withdrawal . The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal . DESIGN : Retrospective observational cohort study . SETTING : Academic tertiary care hospital . PATIENTS : Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria . INTERVENTIONS : Pre and post guideline , all patients were treated in a symptom - triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital . Postguideline , standard symptom - triggered dosing continued as preguideline , plus , the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15 - 0.3 mg / kg / hr continuously until delirium resolved . Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation , a ketamine bolus ( 0.3 mg / kg ) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients . MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS : A total of 63 patients were included ( 29 preguideline ; 34 postguideline ) . Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated ( odds ratio , 0.14 ; p < 0.01 ; 95 % CI , 0.04 - 0.49 ) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days ( 95 % CI , -5.58 to -0.089 ; p = 0.043 ) .

( 0.5 mg / kg )	6364	single intravenous infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and randomized to double‐blind treatment	"Personal and family history of alcohol dependence alters antidepresant response to oral riluzole post - ketamine infusion.^ 
 Background : Family history of alcohol dependence is a positive predictor of ketamine 's antidepressant effects in unipolar and bipolar depression . As we recently suggested that the glutamatergic modulator riluzole may delay time to relapse after ketamine infusion in a 4 week trial , we investigated if a lifetime personal or family history of alcohol dependence mediated riluzole 's effect . Methods : Secondary analysis of randomized , double‐blind placebo controlled trial of treatment‐resistant unipolar depression ( 18‐65 , MADRS≥22 ) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and randomized to double‐blind treatment with riluzole ( 100‐200 mg / day ) or placebo for 4 weeks . Results : Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine ( p=.02 ) . In subjects randomized to placebo , the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response ( p=.002 ) . There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole ( p=.88 ) . No antidepressant difference was observed between placebo and riluzole in subjects with no family history of alcoholism ( p=.27 ) . Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism ( p=.04 ) . Past personal history had no main effect ( p=.057 ) . Conclusions : Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history . Personal history did not emerge as a significant factor . Although this study was not specifically powered based on family history , it is unlikely that riluzole extension post‐ketamine is a useful adjunct based on personal or family history of alcoholism ."
0.5 mg / kg	7554	a single ketamine infusion , 0.5 mg / kg body weight , in bipolar	"Ketamine augmentation rapidly improves depression scores in inpatients with treatment - resistant bipolar depression.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : To study the clinical effect of a single ketamine infusion , 0.5 mg / kg body weight , in bipolar depressive patients receiving mood - stabilising drugs , not improving on antidepressants . Previously , in such patients , we had found a correlation between clinical efficacy , serum brain - derived neurotrophic factor and vitamin B12 levels and a rapid improvement in neurocognitive performance . METHODS : The study included 53 patients ( 13 men , 40 women ) , aged 22 - 81 years , receiving ≥1 mood - stabilising medications of the first and/or second generation . Pre - infusion depression intensity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) was 23.4 ± 4.6 points and the assumed criterion for response was a reduction of ≥50 % in the HDRS score after 7 days . RESULTS : Twenty - seven subjects ( 51 % ) met a criterion for response , more frequently males ( 77 % ) than females ( 43 % ) . Responders did not differ from non - responders as to age , illness onset , duration of depressive episode , type of bipolar illness , family history of psychiatric illness , personal / family history of alcoholism or using lithium , quetiapine or a combination of these mood stabilisers . CONCLUSIONS : The results confirm a rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion in a considerable proportion of those patients with bipolar depression receiving mood - stabilising drugs . Apart from male gender , no other clinical factors were predictors of response ."

0.5mg / kg	4410	) and another infusion of 0.5mg / kg esketamine , with an interval	"Phase II , randomized , double - blind , crossover , placebo - controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Esketamine as an adjunct to standard care in patients with Obsessive - Compulsive Disorder- OCD.^ 
 INTERVENTION : D27.505.954.427.700.122 In a crossover design , all participants will receive an infusion of 0.045mg / kg midazolam ( active placebo ) and another infusion of 0.5mg / kg esketamine , with an interval of two weeks between procedures . All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump . Randomization will be performed in blocks , ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine . Crossing between the blocks will be performed , so that all patients receive both interventions . Participants will be randomly assigned into two distinct groups through a list of random numbers , keeping allocation concealment preserved . Regarding masking , the same investigator responsible for the allocation will prepare the drugs . Study solutions will be provided in identical 50mL syringes containing midazolam or escetamine with the additional volume of saline solution for a total of 50mL. Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9 % saline , making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection . The active placebo used , midazolam , is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms , that is , it does not worsen and does not treat . It is a short‐acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action , a short elimination half‐life , and a similar time course of dissociative and non‐specific behavioral effects ( eg , sedation , disorientation ) to escetamine , thus providing adequate blinding ( Shiroma , 2020 ) . Such medication is widely used in clinical trials ( Peyrovian , 2020 ; Dakwar , 2020 ; Rothberg , 2020 ) , with data in the literature proving the safety of its use in OCD patients ( Bloch 2012 , Rodriguez 2017 ) . The sample size can not be estima CONDITION : obsessive‐compulsive disorder PRIMARY OUTCOME : To compare of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms between the control group and the placebo group from the reduction in the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale score 24h after the infusion , compared to the score before each procedure . It is expected to find a significant reduction , i.e. greater than or equal to 35 % in the total score on the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale . A mixed linear fixed effects model will be used to examine the differences between esketamine and midazolam treatment . A composite symmetry covariance structure appears to be the best fit to the data . The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data . Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests . Significance is assessed at P < 0.05 , two‐tailed . SECONDARY OUTCOME : To assess changes from baseline scores for 24h , 7 , and 14 days after each infusion in the placebo and control groups on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity and Improvement and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale . We will use the same method described for the primary outcome ; To assess the change in the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale total score before each infusion to 7 and 14 days after the procedure between the placebo group and the control group . We will use the same method described for the primary outcome ; To assess the proportion of responders ( participants who achieved a reduction of at least 35 % of symptoms by the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale ) of the placebo group and the control group after 24h , 7 and 14 days after each infusion . To assess the proportion of individuals who respond or remit at each point , a McNemar test will be used at each point for the participants and the results will be Bonferroni corrected for the number of points examined . Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used to compare severity of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms , severity of depressive symptoms ( if any ) and percentage of cumulative reduction of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms compared to percentage of reduction of depressive symptoms ; To evaluate clinical and biological markers ( peripheral biomarkers such as BDNF , IL‐1 , IK6 , TNF‐alpha , IF , microRNAs and serum esketamine level ) and their correspondence with therapeutic response . We will use t‐tests to assess differences in the dosages of these markers at different collection periods and between treatment groups .

0.5 mg / kg	6449	cross - over trial of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine . MDD subjects showed	"Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^ 
 Ketamine 's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography ( MEG ) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized cross - over trial of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine . MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms , and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration . Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine . In MDD subjects , gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect . However , baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post - ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response ; specifically , higher post - ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma , with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma . This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD . This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine 's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone ."
25 mg	6137	use disorder undergoing open‐label psilocybin 25 mg therapy . In the Visual	"Pilot Trial of Visual Healing ® in Psilocybin - assisted Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder.^ 
 The objective of the study is to test a strategy for optimizing Set and Setting for psilocybin‐assisted therapy of alcohol use disorder . Psilocybin shows promise in early trials for alcohol use disorder , but initial results suggest that patients with alcohol use disorder may be less likely to achieve a mystical experience with standard doses of psilocybin . Optimizing Set and Setting for the psilocybin experience may improve outcomes without requiring higher drug doses . The current study will complete a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility , safety , and tolerability of Visual Healing Set and Setting ( N=10 ) versus standard Set and Setting procedures ( N=10 ) in participants with alcohol use disorder undergoing open‐label psilocybin 25 mg therapy . In the Visual Healing condition , participants will view nature‐themed video programs during the Prep session and during the Ascent phase of the psilocybin experience . Anecdotal reports and reviews suggest that viewing Visual Healing creates a tranquil and calming environment that fosters a stronger connection between the viewer and nature . Psilocybin increases the users feeling of connection to nature and having an intention to connect with nature during the psychedelic session is associated with better outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy in initial studies . Reducing pre‐dosing anxiety / apprehension and enhancing connections to nature with Visual Healing may improve outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy without the need for higher psilocybin doses ."

 Objective : Single - dose intravenous ( IV ) injection of ketamine has shown rapid but transient antidepressant effects . The strategy of repeated - dose ketamine infusions to maintain antidepressant effects has received little systematic study . This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of six ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with unipolar and bipolar depression . Methods : Ninety seven patients with unipolar ( n = 77 ) and bipolar ( n = 20 ) depression received repeated ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) with continuous vital sign monitoring . Depressive symptoms were measured by the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Suicidal ideation was assessed using the Scale for Suicidal Ideations ( SSI)-part 1 . Anxiety symptoms were evaluated with the 14 - item Hamilton Anxiety Scale ( HAMA ) . Adverse psychopathological and dissociative effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS)-positive symptoms and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) , respectively . Patients were assessed at baseline , 4 and 24 h , and 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 8 , 9 , 10 , 11 , 12 , 13 and 26 days . Results : After six ketamine infusions , the response and remission rates were 68.0 % and 50.5 % , respectively . There were significant decreases in MADRS , SSI - part 1 , and HAMA scores within four hours following the first ketamine infusion , and the decreases were sustained over the subsequent infusion period . The nonresponder subgroup manifested rapid significant improvement in suicidal ideations throughout the course of treatment . After the six ketamine infusions , the response was positively associated with the response at 24 h after the first infusion ( OR = 8.94 ) , personal income ≥4000 yuan / month ( OR = 3.04 ) , and no history of psychiatric hospitalization ( OR = 3.41 ) . Only CADSS scores had a mild but marginally significant increase after the first infusion but with a significant BPRS score decrease . Conclusion : Six ketamine infusions were safe and effective in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression . The rapid and robust antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion within four hours were sustained following the subsequent infusions ."

 Background : MDMA , in combination with psychotherapy , has shown promise in the treatment of multiple psychiatric disorders . However , it is not known how MDMA interacts with components of the therapeutic process to produce its beneficial effects . We tested the effects of MDMA on four measures of social experience to elucidate the behavioral components that underlie the efficacy of MDMA in combination with psychotherapy . Methods : Healthy volunteers participated in two double‐blind placebo‐controlled studies using a within‐subjects crossover design . In Study 1 ( N=36 ) , they received MDMA ( 0.75mg / kg and 1.5mg / kg ) , methamphetamine ( 20 mg ) , and placebo . In Study 2 ( N=18 of 36 ) , they received MDMA ( 125 mg ) , methamphetamine ( 20 mg ) , and placebo . During peak drug effect , they completed standardized tasks assessing social behavior . These tasks included a social attention bias task , an emotional response to social feedback task , an affective touch task , and a verbal task assessing synchrony of vocal pitch during a social interaction . Results : MDMA ( 1.5mg / kg ) increased attention to faces expressing positive emotions compared to neutral faces ( p<0.05 ) . During the social feedback task , MDMA dose‐dependently increased feelings of social acceptance following all types of social feedback ( p<0.05 ) , and similarly increased pleasantness ratings of affective touch ( p<0.05 ) . Methamphetamine did not produce these effects . Conclusions : These findings build on previous reports that MDMA reduces responses to negative social stimuli by showing that the drug also enhances responses to positive social stimuli .

100 mg	5274	assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo . All	"A randomized controlled trial of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) and fear extinction retention in healthy adults.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Fear conditioning and extinction are well - characterized cross - species models of fear - related posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms , and recent animal data suggest that 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) enhances fear extinction retention . AIMS : This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning , extinction training , and retention in healthy humans . METHODS : The study involved a randomized placebo - controlled , two - group , parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults , age 21 - 55 recruited from a major metropolitan area . The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24 hours later , and 2 hours after study drug administration . Fear extinction retention was measured 48 hours after extinction training . Participants ( N = 34 ; 70.6 % male and 29.4 % female ) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo . All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses . Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs . MDMA was well - tolerated with no serious adverse events . RESULTS : Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences . Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group ( χ(2 ) = 7.29 , p = 0.007 ) . CONCLUSION : Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention , the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention .

 MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ) or ' Ecstasy ' is a widely used recreational drug that produces a state of heightened mood but also cardiovascular and vegetative side - effects . In animals , MDMA releases serotonin and , to a lesser extent , dopamine and norepinephrine . The release of serotonin can be blocked by serotonin uptake inhibitors such as citalopram . It is unknown to what extent this mechanism is also responsible for the physiological side - effects of MDMA seen in humans . We investigated the effect of citalopram pretreatment ( 40 mg i.v . ) on vegetative and cardiovascular effects of MDMA ( 1.5 mg / kg p.o . ) in a double - blind placebo - controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers . MDMA moderately increased blood pressure and heart rate , slightly elevated body temperature and produced a broad range of acute and short - term side - effects . Citalopram reduced all these MDMA - induced physiological changes except for body temperature . These findings suggest that physiological effects of MDMA in humans are partially due to an interaction of MDMA with the serotonin carrier and a subsequent release of serotonin ."

 Research has shown that psychedelics , such as lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , have profound anti - inflammatory properties mediated by 5 - HT(2A ) receptor signaling , supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease . OBJECTIVE : This study evaluated the safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg , 10 μg , and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals . In the current paper , we present safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety , tolerability , and dose response . METHODS : This was a phase 1 double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized study . Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups ( 5 μg , 10 μg , 20 μg LSD , and placebo ) , and received their assigned dose on six occasions ( i.e. , every 4 days ) . RESULTS : Forty - eight older healthy volunteers ( mean age = 62.9 years ) received placebo ( n = 12 ) , 5 μg ( n = 12 ) , 10 μg ( n = 12 ) , or 20 μg ( n = 12 ) LSD . LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min . LSD was well tolerated , and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo . Assessments of cognition , balance , and proprioception revealed no impairment . CONCLUSIONS : Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg , 10 μg , and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21 - day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer 's disease ( AD ) ."

In the current paper , we present safety , tolerability , pharmacokinetics , and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety , tolerability , and dose response . METHODS : This was a phase 1 double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized study . Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups ( 5 μg , 10 μg , 20 μg LSD , and placebo ) , and received their assigned dose on six occasions ( i.e. , every 4 days ) . RESULTS : Forty - eight older healthy volunteers ( mean age = 62.9 years ) received placebo ( n = 12 ) , 5 μg ( n = 12 ) , 10 μg ( n = 12 ) , or 20 μg ( n = 12 ) LSD . LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min . LSD was well tolerated , and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo . Assessments of cognition , balance , and proprioception revealed no impairment .

 Eligible women for elective cesarean section admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit of Prentice Women 's Hospital will be approached for study participation immediately after the routine preanesthetic evaluation . This occurs shortly after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit . Women who agree to participate will give written , informed consent at this time . Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with intravenous ( IV ) access , aspiration prophylaxis and intraoperative monitoring . Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic medications will be used as per usual practice after delivery . The anesthesiologist will perform a spinal anesthetic per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3‐4 interspace ( ± one vertebral interspace ) . The spinal anesthetic will consist of 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl + 150 μg of morphine . The subject will be placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression . Cesarean section will commence after adequate anesthesia is assured to a T4 sensory level to pinprick . Vasopressors and IV fluids will be administered at the anesthesiologist 's discretion per usual practice . At the time of delivery , subjects will be randomized to one of two groups using a computer generated random number table . Randomization will be blocked based on whether the cesarean procedure is a primary or a repeat procedure . Randomization assignments will be kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes . The envelope will be opened by a research nurse who will prepare a 20 mL syringe labeled "" study drug "" . The syringe will be given to the anesthesiologist blinded to the treatment group who will subsequently administer the study drug . Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive ketamine 10 mg ( ketamine 10 mg / mL ) diluted to 20 mL with 0.9 % preservative free saline . Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive 20 mL preservative free saline . The study drug will be administered into the intravenous line via an infusion pump over 10 minutes . Five minutes after placebo or drug administration , the anesthesiologist will ask the subject if she has nausea , vomiting and pruritus . Nausea and pruritus will be graded as none , mild , moderate or severe ; and vomiting as present or absent . Any spontaneous complaints of psychedelic effects will be noted at this time . Sedation will be assessed via the Richmond agitation‐sedation scale ( RASS [ see Appendix 1 ] ) . Upon completion of the cesarean section , the subject will be transported to the post anesthesia recovery unit . Patients will receive ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hours time 4 doses beginning shortly after admission to the PACU . At 1 h , 4 h , 8 h , 12 h and at 24 h after administration of the study drug , the subject 's pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale for pain NRS 0‐10 ( see Appendix 2 ) . Patients may request rescue analgesia if they are experiencing discomfort . The time of first rescue analgesia request will be noted , and the NRS will be determined at the time of request for rescue analgesia . Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per os . An additional dose of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg will be provided after 1 hour if the pain is not relieved to the subject 's satisfaction . These are routine oral analgesic medications for postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia . Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and respiratory rate , and treatment of side effects ( nausea , vomiting , pruritus and respiratory depression ) . The total amount of rescue medication will be determined for each subject after 24 , 48 and 72 hours . The presence of nausea , vomiting , and pruritus will be assessed at the same time intervals as the NRS for pain : 1 h , 4 h , 8 h , 12 h and 24 h after IV infusion of ketamine or placebo . The subjective psychedelic effects of ketamine and morphine will be assessed using a set of true / false questions from the LSD and morphine short form of the Addiction Research Center In entory , ARCI ( Appendix 3 ) . These questions will be administered verbally by the anesthesiologist or researcher blinded to the treatment group upon admission to the PACU and at 4 h. The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and secondary outcome data : maternal age , height , weight , prepregnancy weight , gestational age and IV fluids administered during cesarean section . In addition , all intraoperative and postoperative medications will be recorded , including those administered for the treatment of side effects listed above . Protocol specific analgesia assessment ends 24 hours after administration of the study drug . At 72 hours the subject will be asked about her satisfaction with postoperative analgesia ( 100 mm scale , 0 mm = not satisfied at all , 100 mm = very satisfied ) . One telephone follow‐up evaluation 2 weeks after delivery will again , assess for satisfaction with analgesia and average pain ( NRS ) since the procedure ."
25 mg	56	dose of synthetic psilocybin , 25 mg , was administered . Psychotropic	"Single - Dose Synthetic Psilocybin With Psychotherapy for Treatment - Resistant Bipolar Type II Major Depressive Episodes : A Nonrandomized Controlled Trial.^ 
 IMPORTANCE : Bipolar II disorder ( BDII ) is a debilitating condition frequently associated with difficult - to - treat depressive episodes . Psilocybin has evidence for rapid - acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression . OBJECTIVE : To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : This was a 12 - week , open - label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital . Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII , a current depressive episode longer than 3 months , and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate . Of 70 approached , 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled . The trial was conducted between April 14 , 2021 , and January 5 , 2023 . INTERVENTIONS : A single dose of synthetic psilocybin , 25 mg , was administered . Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing . Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment , during the 8 - hour dosing day , and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating scale ( MADRS ) at 3 weeks posttreatment . Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment , the self - rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms - Self Rating ( QIDS - SR ) , and the self - rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire - Short Form ( Q - LES - Q - SF ) , each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits . Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale ( CSSRS ) and the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) completed at each visit . RESULTS : Of the 15 participants in this study ( 6 male and 9 female ; mean [ SD ] age , 37.8 [ 11.6 ] years ) , all had lower scores at week 3 , with a mean ( SD ) change of -24.00 ( 9.23 ) points on the MADRS , ( Cohen d = 4.08 ; 95 % CI , -29.11 to -18.89 ; P < .001 ) . Repeat measures analysis of variance showed lower MADRS scores at all tested posttreatment time points , including the end point ( Cohen d = 3.39 ; 95 % CI , -33.19 to -16.95 ; adjusted P < .001 ) . At week 3 , 12 participants met the response criterion ( 50 % decrease in MADRS ) , and 11 met remission criterion ( MADRS score ≤10 ) . At the study end point , 12 patients met both response and remission criteria . QIDS - SR scores and Q - LES - Q - SF scores demonstrated similar improvements . YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : The findings in this open - label nonrandomized controlled trial suggest efficacy and safety of psilocybin with psychotherapy in BDII depression and supports further study of psychedelics in this population ."

 BACKGROUND : Anecdotal reports suggest that psychedelic agents may relieve symptoms of obsessive - compulsive disorder ( OCD ) . This modified double - blind study investigated the safety , tolerability , and clinical effects of psilocybin , a potent 5 - HT(1A ) and 5 - HT(2A/2C ) agonist , in patients with OCD . METHOD : Nine subjects with DSM - IV - defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single - dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub - hallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic . Low ( 100 microg / kg ) , medium ( 200 microg / kg ) , and high ( 300 microg / kg ) doses were assigned in that order , and a very low dose ( 25 microg / kg ) was inserted randomly and in double - blind fashion at any time after the first dose . Testing days were separated by at least 1 week . Each session was conducted over an 8 - hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic ; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation . The Yale - Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale ( YBOCS ) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive - compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0 , 4 , 8 , and 24 hours post - ingestion . The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours , and vital signs were recorded at 0 , 1 , 4 , 8 , and 24 hours after ingestion . The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004 . RESULTS : Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses . One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms , but no other significant adverse effects were observed . Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions ( 23%-100 % decrease in YBOCS score ) . Repeated - measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda ( F = 9.86 , df = 3,3 ; p = .046 ) , but no significant effect of dose ( F = 2.25 , df = 3,3 ; p = .261 ) or interaction of time and dose ( F = 0.923 , df = 9,45 ; p = .515 ) . Improvement generally lasted past the 24 - hour timepoint . CONCLUSIONS : In a controlled clinical environment , psilocybin was safely used in subjects with OCD and was associated with acute reductions in core OCD symptoms in several subjects ."

 Glutamatergic dysfunction may play an important role in both the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , and impaired memory commonly observed in that disorder . NMDA receptor antagonists impair learning / memory in animal models , putatively based on its ability to block long - term potentiation ( LTP ) in the hippocampus . Although well studied in animal models , research in humans is limited and confounded by administration of NMDA antagonists before the learning experience . Based on presumed glutamatergic dysfunction , it was predicted that the NMDA antagonist ketamine would not effect memory in schizophrenic subjects . Bolus injections of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or placebo were given to seven patients with schizophrenia in this double - blind cross - over study . Immediately prior to injection , subjects were administered verbal and figural memory tests . Delayed recalls were obtained 30 - 45 min postinjection . In order to rule out drug - induced generalized cognitive impairments , other cognitive tasks were administered pre- and postinjection . The results indicate no differences between the drug and placebo conditions for either memory task , and no changes on the other cognitive tasks observed ."
0.3 mg / kg	8706	, in a dose of 0.3 mg / kg i.v . , on concurrent	"The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating , neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^ 
 Recently , much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N - methyl - D - aspartate receptors ( NMDA ) in sensory gating , such as prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential ( ERP ) . Currently , mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes . Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important , for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia . Therefore , the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine , in a dose of 0.3 mg / kg i.v . , on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers . Ketamine was administered in a pseudo - steady state model with a subacute loading dose . In addition , the effects of ketamine on behavior , vital signs , homovanillic acid ( HVA ) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone ( LH ) were also determined . Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP . A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) total scores and BPRS composite scores "" thinking disorder "" and "" withdrawal / retardation "" was observed . Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations , but complex hallucinations did not occur . Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems . In addition , ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion , while LH secretion was not affected . Finally , systolic and diastolic , blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion . Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction , the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment . However , using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine . Future studies should use the enantiomer S - ketamine , which is more specific to NMDA receptors , to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further ."

 Background : Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast - acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depression . How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole - brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized . Methods : Data - driven whole brain functional connectivity ( FC ) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . MDD patients ( N = 61 , mean age = 38 , 19 women ) completed baseline resting - state ( RS ) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales . Of these patients , n = 48 and n = 51 , completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg / kg intravenous ketamine infusions . Healthy controls ( HC ) ( n = 40 , 24 women ) completed baseline assessments with no intervention . Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis , time , and remitter status . Results : Significant differences ( p < 0.05 , corrected ) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks . These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment . Furthermore , following serial ketamine infusions , significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network ( SN ) ( p < 0.05 , corrected ) . Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment , whereas non - remitters showed the opposite pattern . Conclusion : Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients . Cortico - striatal - cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment . ( PsycInfo Database Record ( c ) 2022 APA , all rights reserved )"

 RATIONALE : Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness . Since 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders , a blinded , placebo - controlled pilot study was conducted . OBJECTIVES : To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA - assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population . METHODS : Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA ( 75 to 125 mg , n = 8) or inactive placebo ( 0 mg , n = 4 ) during two 8 - h psychotherapy sessions ( experimental sessions ) in a controlled clinical setting . Double - blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non - drug psychotherapy sessions following each . The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session . Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session . RESULTS : Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group ( P = 0.037 ) , and placebo - subtracted Cohen 's d effect size was very large ( d = 1.4 , CI - 0.074 , 2.874 ) . Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6 - month follow - up showed similar positive results ( P = 0.036 ) , with a Cohen 's d effect size of 1.1 ( CI - 0.307 , 2.527 ) . Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase . CONCLUSIONS : This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA - assisted psychotherapy . Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety .

0.5 mg / kg	791	assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg / kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions .	"Low - dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^ 
 Background : ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , “ ecstasy ” ) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness . These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use . Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli , such as social threat , rejection , and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces . In line with these findings , MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship . However , the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested . Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers . Methods : Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat , we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task . Healthy adult volunteers ( N = 26 ) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg / kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions . They attended two sessions , during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task ( Trier Social Stress Test ) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task . Throughout the sessions , the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug , their mood , and how stressful they found the task . Measures of salivary cortisol , heart rate , and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals , in addition to measures of autonomic activity ( high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography ) . Results : As expected , the stress task effectively increased heart rate , blood pressure , salivary cortisol , and subjective ratings of stress in both groups . Contrary to our hypothesis , MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress , and decreased participants ' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task . MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session . Conclusions : While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts , it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task . In fact , this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress . This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs , but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli . It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin , which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA 's prosocial effects . It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA , including doses that increase oxytocin levels , do dampen stress responses ."

 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , "" ecstasy "" ) is a recreational drug of increasing use among youth because of its apparent entactogenic properties , such as euphoria , friendliness , closeness , and empathy . However , experimental studies have shown MDMA to be neurotoxic . Data on pharmacologic actions of MDMA in humans are limited . The authors conducted a randomized , double - blind , crossover , controlled trial to assess psychomotor performance and subjective effects in eight healthy male volunteers . MDMA was given in the same range of doses used for recreational purposes ( 75 and 125 mg ) . Amphetamine ( 40 mg ) and placebo were used as reference compounds . For the digit - symbol substitution test ( DSST ) , MDMA-125 produced a mild decrease in responses , and amphetamine produced a mild improvement . For the Maddox wing device , MDMA-125 induced esophoria compared with the other drug conditions . MDMA-125 and MDMA-75 produced increases in feelings of euphoria and well - being , as noted by increases in scores on the Addiction Research Center Inventory ( ARCI ) MBG and A scales , as well as scores of "" stimulated , "" "" good effects , "" "" liking , "" and "" high "" on the visual analog scales . Amphetamine administration induced similar effects . At the same time , MDMA-125 enhanced sedation- and dysphoria - related effects ( ARCI - PCAG and LSD , "" confusion , "" "" drunken , "" and Profile of Mood States Confusion scale ) . Mild changes in some body perception - related feelings were also reported after MDMA use , but hallucinations or psychoses were not present . In summary , the short - term administration of MDMA produced marked euphoria , a slight impairment in the performance of psychomotor tasks , and mild changes in body perceptions without hallucinations . These data support the abuse liability of MDMA ."

 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ecstasy ) is a popular psychostimulant , frequently associated with multiple administrations over a short period of time . Repeated administration of MDMA in experimental settings induces tolerance and metabolic inhibition . The aim is to determine the acute pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics resulting from two consecutive 100 mg doses of MDMA separated by 4h . Ten male volunteers participated in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , placebo - controlled trial . The four conditions were placebo plus placebo , placebo plus MDMA , MDMA plus placebo , and MDMA plus MDMA . Outcome variables included pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetic parameters . After a second dose of MDMA , most effects were similar to those after a single dose , despite a doubling of MDMA concentrations ( except for systolic blood pressure and reaction time ) . After repeated MDMA administration , a 2 - fold increase was observed in MDMA plasma concentrations . For a simple dose accumulation MDMA and MDA concentrations were higher ( +23.1 % Cmax and +17.1 % AUC for MDMA and +14.2 % Cmax and +10.3 % AUC for MDA ) and HMMA and HMA concentrations lower ( -43.3 % Cmax and -39.9 % AUC for HMMA and -33.2 % Cmax and -35.1 % AUC for HMA ) than expected , probably related to MDMA metabolic autoinhibition . Although MDMA concentrations doubled after the second dose , most pharmacological effects were similar or slightly higher in comparison to the single administration , except for systolic blood pressure and reaction time which were greater than predicted . The pharmacokinetic - effects relationship suggests that when MDMA is administered at a 4h interval there exists a phenomenon of acute tolerance to its effects ."

0.5mg / kg	6357	single open‐label subanesthetic dose ( 0.5mg / kg ) ketamine infusion over 40	"Riluzole likely lacks antidepressant efficacy in ketamine non - responders.^ 
 Background : In our primary analysis of a four‐week riluzole extension trial after open‐label ketamine in treatment‐resistant major depressive disorder ( TRD ) , there was no significant difference in depression scores between riluzole and placebo extension ( Ibrahim et al . , 2012 ) . Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders , which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders ( Mathew et al . , 2010 ) . However , as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD , and , although glutamatergic , its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine 's , we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders . Methods : 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [ Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion ) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose ( 0.5mg / kg ) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes . 4‐6 hours post‐infusion , subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose ( 100‐200mg / day ) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks . Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis , and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule ( 50mg / week to a minimum of 100mg / day ) for intolerable side effects . The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure . Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50 % and<50 % improvement , respectively , from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes ( last pre‐randomization time point ) . Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor . MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate . All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model . Results : At 230 minutes post‐infusion , 32 patients were non‐responders , and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm . There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics ( including length of illness , length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials ) between groups . The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [ F(1,29)=0.62 , p=.44 ] or time [ F(27,231)=1.50 , p=.058 ] . There was also no interaction between drug and time [ F(27,231)=1.15 , p=.29 ] . This small sample size , however , may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect . In non‐responders , riluzole 's maximum effect was observed at day one ( d=.39 ) but was lost by day six . Yet , at the end of protocol , sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo : 8/16 ( 50 % ) drop‐outs ; riluzole : 6/16 ( 38 % ) dropouts . There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups ( p=.72 ) , and , with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea , the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications , i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood , anxiety or suicidal ideation . At day 28 , there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo ( 6 % ) and no responders randomized to riluzole ( drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders ) . Conclusions : Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect , riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders . There are several potential limitations , however , that may preclude broader generalization to other populations : our highly‐refractory cohort and insufficient trial duration ."

 OBJECTIVE : Intravenous ketamine , which displays rapid antidepressant properties , is posited to reverse depression by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity . The authors tested whether an automated , computer - based approach could efficiently leverage enhanced neuroplasticity to extend the durability of rapid clinical response . METHODS : A total of 154 adults ( ages 18 - 60 ) with treatment - resistant unipolar depression were randomized in a double - blind , parallel - arm design to receive an active / active treatment combination ( ketamine plus active "" automated self - association training "" [ ASAT ] ; N=53 ) or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug component ( saline plus active ASAT ; N=51 ) or the active behavioral component ( ketamine plus sham ASAT ; N=50 ) . One day after a single infusion of intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) or inert placebo ( saline ) , active ASAT - targeting self - worth through automated "" evaluative conditioning "" training delivered by computer - or sham ASAT ( consisting of identical computer tasks that included no positive or self - referential stimuli ) was given , delivered twice daily over 4 consecutive days ( eight sessions , ≤20 minutes per session ) . The prespecified primary outcome measure throughout the main ( 30 - day ) study period was score on the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . RESULTS : Ketamine rapidly and significantly reduced depression scores at 24 hours postinfusion ( group - by - time interaction : standardized beta [ β]=-1.30 , 95 % CI=-1.89 , -0.70 ; t=-4.29 , df=150 ) . In intent - to - treat linear mixed models , depression scores in the ketamine+ASAT group remained significantly and stably low over the 30 - day study period relative to those of the saline+ASAT group ( β=-0.61 , 95 % CI=-0.95 , -0.28 ; t=-3.62 , df=148 ) . By contrast , depression scores following ketamine+sham treatment followed a significant , increasing linear trajectory from 24 hours to 30 days , approaching the levels observed in the saline+ASAT group ( group - by - time interaction relative to the saline+ASAT group : β=0.015 , 95 % CI=0.003 , 0.03 ; t=2.35 , df=568 ) . CONCLUSIONS : After priming the brain with ketamine , training positive self - associations could provide an efficient , low - cost , portable , noninvasive , and highly dissemination - ready strategy for leveraging and extending ketamine 's rapid antidepressant effects ."

15 mg	6869	hospital observation , patients received 15 mg of intranasal ketamine every 6	"Intranasal ketamine for acute cluster headache attacks - Results from a proof - of - concept open - label trial.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : To investigate the safety and efficacy of intranasal ketamine for the treatment of a single cluster headache ( CH ) attack . BACKGROUND : Acute treatment options for patients with CH who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited . Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a CH attack . METHODS : We conducted an open - label pilot study enrolling 23 patients with chronic CH ( International Classification of Headache Disorders , 3rd edition ) , and of these , 20 patients treated a single CH attack with intranasal ketamine . Under in - hospital observation , patients received 15 mg of intranasal ketamine every 6 min a maximum of five times . The primary endpoint was a 50 % reduction in pain intensity within 15 min after initiating treatment . RESULTS : The primary endpoint was not met ; 15 min after the first ketamine administration , the mean reduction in pain intensity was 1.1 ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] : -0.6 to 2.7 , p = 0.188 ) on the numeric rating scale ( NRS ) , equivalent to a 15 % reduction in pain intensity . However , 30 min after the first application , the pain intensity was reduced by 59 % on an 11 - point NRS ( mean difference : 4.3 , 95 % CI : 2.4 - 6.2 , p < 0.001 , N = 16 ) and 11 out of 16 ( 69 % ) scored 4 or below on the NRS . Four patients received rescue medication 15 min after the first ketamine application and were therefore excluded from the analysis at 30 min . Half of the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection . No serious adverse events were identified during the trial . CONCLUSION : Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment for CH at 30 min but should be tested in a larger controlled design . Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine ."
0.5 mg / kg	4922	receiving a single infusion of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine or 0.045 mg /	"Right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex volumetric reduction is associated with antidepressant effect of low - dose ketamine infusion : A randomized , double - blind , midazolam - controlled PET - MRI clinical trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Evidence has shown a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of low - dose ketamine infusion among patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) and prominent suicidal ideation ( SI ) . The dorsolateral prefrontal cortex ( DLPFC ) plays a crucial role in the TRD pathomechanisms . OBJECTIVE : Whether the structural and functional changes of the DLPFC , particularly Brodmann area 46 , are associated with the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion among such patients is unknown . METHODS : We randomized 48 patients with TRD and SI into groups receiving a single infusion of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine or 0.045 mg / kg midazolam . The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale and the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale were used to assess symptoms . Positron emission tomography ( PET)-magnetic resonance imaging was conducted prior to infusion and on Day 3 postinfusion . We performed longitudinal voxel - based morphometry ( VBM ) analysis to evaluate the gray matter ( GM ) volume changes of the DLPFC . The standardized uptake value ratio ( SUVr ) of ( 18)F - fluorodeoxyglucose PET images was calculated using the SUV of the cerebellum as a reference region . RESULTS : The VBM analysis revealed a small but significant volumetric reduction in the right DLPFC in the ketamine group compared with that in the midazolam group . A greater reduction in depressive symptoms was associated with a smaller decrease in right DLPFC volumes ( p = 0.025 ) . However , we found no SUVr changes of the DLPFC between baseline and post - Day 3 ketamine infusion . DISCUSSION : The optimal modulation of the right DLPFC GM volumes may play an essential role in the antidepressant neuromechanisms of low - dose ketamine ."
0.5 mg / kg	9277	that involved ketamine administration at 0.5 mg / kg IV in addition to propofol	"Low - dose ketamine does not improve the speed of recovery from depression in electroconvulsive therapy : a randomized controlled trial.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a well - established therapeutic intervention for major depressive disorder . Recent literature has shown that the anesthetic agent ketamine has some antidepressant properties at low doses and may be an alternative therapy for treatment - resistant major depressive disorder . We hypothesized that the use of low - dose ketamine as an anesthetic adjunct in ECT would more rapidly improve depression while maintaining hemodynamic stability than ECT with propofol alone . METHODS : Institutional ethics approval was obtained , and the use of ketamine in this study was approved by Health Canada . This is a randomized , double - blinded , placebo - controlled trial that involved ketamine administration at 0.5 mg / kg IV in addition to propofol anesthesia for ECT . The primary outcome was the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50 % reduction in the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Secondary outcomes included the number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 25 % reduction in MADRS score , as well as any differences in the Clinical Global Impression Scale for Severity , hemodynamic variables , and seizure duration . Adverse events were recorded for safety assessment . RESULTS : A total of 45 patients completed the study . No difference was found between groups with respect to the primary or secondary outcomes . The ketamine group showed a trend towards a decreased dose of propofol required to achieve adequate anesthesia . No adverse events were reported . CONCLUSION : Low - dose ketamine does not improve psychiatric outcomes in the setting of propofol - based anesthesia for ECT . Specifically , ketamine did not reduce the number of ECT sessions necessary to achieve a 50 or 25 % reduction in MADRS scores . Reassuringly , the fact that no differences in hemodynamic variables or unexpected adverse events occurred suggests that low - dose ketamine may be safely used in this setting should clinical indications warrant its use .

 In animals , two - choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems . In order to delineate the relative role of these systems , three - choice paradigms have been used in animals , with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin . Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action . To parallel animal studies , the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist , d - amphetamine , a prototypic serotonergic agonist , meta - chlorophenylpiperazine ( mCPP ) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA .

 BACKGROUND : Ketamine is known to rapidly reduce depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation ( SI ) in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) , but evidence is limited for its acceptability and effectiveness in "" real - world "" settings . This case series examines serial ketamine infusions in reducing SI and depression scores in adults with MDD admitted to a tertiary care hospital . METHODS : Five inpatients with MDD and SI admitted to hospital in Toronto , Canada received six infusions of 0.5 mg / kg intravenous ( IV ) ketamine ( n = 5 ) over approximately 12 days , in addition to treatment - as - usual . Suicide and depression rating scores ( Scale for Suicidal Ideation , SSI ; Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale , MADRS ) were obtained at baseline , on treatment days , on days 14 and 42 ( primary endpoint ) . RESULTS : All patients experienced benefit with ketamine . SSI scores diminished by 84 % from 14.0 ± 4.5 at baseline to 2.2 ± 2.5 at study endpoint . MADRS scores diminished by 47 % from 42.2 ± 5.3 at baseline to 22.4 ± 8.0 . Two patients withdrew from the study , one to initiate electroconvulsive therapy and one due to an adverse event ( dissociative effects ) during the ketamine infusion . LIMITATIONS : The major limitation of this study is the small sample size . DISCUSSION : These preliminary pilot data are promising with a greater than two - fold reduction in SI following ketamine infusions . They demonstrate that six serial ketamine infusions may be safe and feasible . These findings support the need for large scale randomized controlled trials to confirm the efficacy of serial ketamine for treatment of SI in "" real - world "" settings ."
125 mg	8271	single placebo or MDMA ( 125 mg ) dose . Bupropion pretreatment	"Impact of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Function on the Chiral Blood Plasma Pharmacokinetics of 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) and Its Phase I and II Metabolites in Humans.^ 
 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ; ecstasy ) metabolism is known to be stereoselective , with preference for S - stereoisomers . Its major metabolic step involves CYP2D6 - catalyzed demethylenation to 3,4 - dihydroxymethamphetamine ( DHMA ) , followed by methylation and conjugation . Alterations in CYP2D6 genotype and/or phenotype have been associated with higher toxicity . Therefore , the impact of CYP2D6 function on the plasma pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its phase I and II metabolites was tested by comparing extensive metabolizers ( EMs ) , intermediate metabolizers ( IMs ) , and EMs that were pretreated with bupropion as a metabolic inhibitor in a controlled MDMA administration study . Blood plasma samples were collected from 16 healthy participants ( 13 EMs and three IMs ) up to 24 h after MDMA administration in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , four - period , cross - over design , with subjects receiving 1 week placebo or bupropion pretreatment followed by a single placebo or MDMA ( 125 mg ) dose . Bupropion pretreatment increased the maximum plasma concentration ( Cmax ) and area under the plasma concentration - time curve from 0 to 24 h ( AUC24 ) of R - MDMA ( 9 % and 25 % , respectively ) and S - MDMA ( 16 % and 38 % , respectively ) . Bupropion reduced the Cmax and AUC24 of the CYP2D6 - dependently formed metabolite stereoisomers of DHMA 3 - sulfate , DHMA 4 - sulfate , and 4 - hydroxy-3 - methoxymethamphetamine ( HMMA sulfate and HMMA glucuronide ) by approximately 40 % . The changes that were observed in IMs were generally comparable to bupropion - pretreated EMs . Although changes in stereoselectivity based on CYP2D6 activity were observed , these likely have low clinical relevance . Bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer pharmacokinetics were unaltered by MDMA co - administration . The present data might aid further interpretations of toxicity based on CYP2D6 - dependent MDMA metabolism ."

This study assessed the interactive effects of a ketamine ( i.v . bolus of 0.26 mg / kg followed by an infusion of 0.65 mg / kg per hour ) and lorazepam 2 mg . , PO , in humans . Twenty - three healthy subjects completed 4 test days involving the oral administration of lorazepam or matched placebo 2 h prior to the i.v . infusion of ketamine or placebo . Ketamine : 1 ) produced behaviors similar to the positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia as assessed by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) ; 2 ) evoked perceptual alterations as measured by the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) ; 3 ) impaired performance on the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test ( WCST ) and other tests sensitive to frontal cortical impairment ; and 4 ) had amnestic effects . Lorazepam produced attention impairments , concrete proverb interpretations , and recall impairments . Lorazepam reduced ketamine - associated emotional distress and there was a non - significant trend for it to decrease perceptual alterations produced by ketamine . However , it failed to reduce many cognitive and behavioral effects of ketamine , including psychosis . Further , lorazepam exacerbated the sedative , attention - impairing , and amnestic effects of ketamine . There was no evidence of pharmacokinetic interaction between these medications . These data suggest that subhypnotic lorazepam and ketamine show a spectrum of interactive effects , ranging from antagonism to potentiation ."
0.26 mg / kg	6643	360 min after psilocybin ( 0.26 mg / kg ) ingestion ) , brief	"The effects of psilocybin on brain EEG activity and connectivity in healthy volunteers - focus on the dynamics of the psychedelic state.^ 
 Introduction.‐ A serotonin 5‐HT2A / C agonist , psychedelic drug psilocybin , is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression . Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects , continuous data are lacking . Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters , brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin . Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers ( 10 M/10F , 28‐50yrs ) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial . A standard 19 channel EEG ( registered before and 60 , 90 , 180 and 360 min after psilocybin ( 0.26 mg / kg ) ingestion ) , brief psychiatric rating scale ( BPRS ) , plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session , a subjective scale “ altered scale of consciousness scale ( ASCs ) ” at the end of measurements . Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography ( LORETA ) . Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms , especially changes in perception and thought disturbances , peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels . Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects . The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band , but increased in all other frequency bands at peak , however , six hours after ingestion , the effects were inverted . Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end .

0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg	4356	which they received MDMA ( 0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg or placebo , double blind	"MDMA : a social drug in a social context.^ 
 RATIONALE : The drug ±3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , "" ecstasy , "" "" molly "" ) is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction . However , in most laboratory studies to date , the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions , which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings . METHODS : Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA ( 0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg or placebo , double blind ) . They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions , in which they were tested alone ( solitary ( SOL ) ; N = 10 ) , in the presence of a research assistant ( research assistant present ( RAP ) ; N = 11 ) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug ( other participant present ( OPP ) ; N = 11 ) . RESULTS : As expected , MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups . It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP . The social context affected certain responses to the drug . The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition , compared to the SOL or RAP conditions , on measures of "" feel drug , "" "" dizzy , "" and on cardiovascular . But responses to the drug on other measures , including social behavior , did not differ across the conditions . CONCLUSIONS : These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users . However , the influence of the social context was modest , and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs ."

 RATIONALE : The party drug ecstasy is frequently used in combination with other drugs like marihuana and alcohol . In addition , a substantial proportion of the MDMA users has claimed to drive a car when under the influence of MDMA and/or other drugs . OBJECTIVE : To assess the effects of MDMA and alcohol , combined and alone , on actual driving performance and laboratory tasks related to driving . METHODS : Eighteen healthy subjects participated in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , six - way cross - over study . Treatments consisted of MDMA 0 , 75 , and 100 mg with and without alcohol , aiming at 0.06 mg / ml BAC . Laboratory tests ( critical tracking task , object movement estimation task ) were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h postdrug ( 0.5 and 1 h postalcohol ) . Actual driving tests ( road tracking test , car - following test ) were conducted between 3 and 5 h postdrug ( 2 and 4 h postalcohol ) . Subjects completed the addiction research center inventory ( ARCI ) and rated their driving quality and mental effort during driving . RESULTS : Alcohol alone impaired critical tracking performance , as well as a number of actual driving performance parameters [ i.e. , standard deviation of lateral position ( SDLP ) , brake reaction time , and coherence ] . MDMA alone reduced SDLP and standard deviation of speed . MDMA significantly moderated alcohol induced impairment of road tracking performance but did not affect alcohol impairments of car - following and laboratory task performance . Subjective data seemed to support objective data . CONCLUSION : MDMA moderated the impairing effects of a low dose of alcohol on road tracking performance but it could not overcome alcohol - induced impairment on other aspects of driving behavior or driving related performance ."
84 mg	5828	sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered	"Effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants : a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study.^ 
 BACKGROUND : The effect of intranasal esketamine on cognitive functioning in healthy participants is assessed in this study . METHODS : Twenty - four participants ( 19 - 49 years ) were randomized to one of two treatment sequences in which either esketamine 84 mg or placebo was intranasally administered in a double - blind , two - period crossover design . Primary measures included five tests of Cogstate ( ® ) computerized test battery assessed at 1 h predose and 40 min , 2 , 4 , and 6 h postdose . Secondary measures included the Mental Effort Scale , Karolinska Sleepiness Scale ( KSS ) , and safety . RESULTS : Esketamine was associated with significant cognitive performance impairment at 40 min postdose for all five Cogstate ® tests ( Detection p = 0.0011 , Identification p = 0.0006 , One - Card Learning p = 0.0040 , One Back p = 0.0017 , and Groton Maze Learning Test p < 0.0001 ) versus placebo . In contrast , performance on these tests did not differ significantly between esketamine and placebo at 2 , 4 , or 6 h postdose . Secondary outcomes indicated a significant , transient increase from baseline under esketamine versus placebo at 40 min postdose on the Mental Effort Scale and at 40 min and 2 h postdose on KSS ( p < 0.0001 for both ) ; however , no significant difference was observed on these outcomes between esketamine and placebo at later timepoints . The most commonly reported adverse events were dizziness ( 67 % ) , nausea ( 37.5 % ) , disturbance in attention ( 29.2 % ) , and fatigue ( 29.2 % ) ; the majority were considered mild in severity . CONCLUSIONS : Esketamine was associated with cognitive performance decline , and greater effort was required to complete the test battery versus placebo at 40 min postdose , which returned to placebo - comparable levels by 2 h postdose .

 Background : Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users . Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA . The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments . The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known . We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol , implicated in the regulation of memory performance , can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA . In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor ( Metyrapone ) together with a single dose of MDMA . Methods : Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions . The treatments consisted of MDMA ( 75 mg ) and Metyrapone ( 750 mg ) , alone and in combination , and double placebo . A dose of 750 mg Metyrapone had previously been used in other studies and it was shown that it effectively suppresses the synthesis of cortisol within 2 hours post‐dose . Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration . Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests . Cortisol levels were determined in blood ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective . Results : Main findings indicated that whereas treatment withMetyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood , it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening . Conclusion : We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA ."
.5 mg / kg	9484	of either ketamine hydrochloride ( .5 mg / kg ) or placebo on 2	"Replication of ketamine 's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression : a randomized controlled add - on trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Currently , no pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression exist that exert rapid ( within hours ) antidepressant or antisuicidal effects . We previously reported that intravenous administration of the N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist ketamine produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment - resistant bipolar depression . The present study sought to replicate this finding in an independent sample . METHODS : In this double - blind , randomized , crossover , placebo - controlled study , 15 subjects with DSM - IV bipolar I or II depression maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride ( .5 mg / kg ) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart . The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale , which was used to rate overall depressive symptoms at baseline ; at 40 , 80 , 110 , and 230 minutes postinfusion ; and on days 1 , 2 , 3 , 7 , 10 , and 14 postinfusion . RESULTS : Within 40 minutes , depressive symptoms , as well as suicidal ideation , significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo ( d = .89 , 95 % confidence interval = .61 - 1.16 , and .98 , 95 % confidence interval = .64 - 1.33 , respectively ) ; this improvement remained significant through day 3 . Seventy - nine percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 0 % responded to placebo at some point during the trial . The most common side effect was dissociative symptoms , which occurred only at the 40 - minute time point . CONCLUSIONS : This study replicated our previous finding that patients with bipolar depression who received a single ketamine infusion experienced a rapid and robust antidepressant response . In addition , we found that ketamine rapidly improved suicidal ideation in these patients ."

 Introduction : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder . Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment - response times , while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects . In recent years , there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD . Therefore , this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate ( 15±5 mg/70 kg ) to high ( 25 ± 5 mg/70 kg ) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD . Methods : The review included a literature search using PubMed ( Medline ) , SCOPUS , Web of Science , and Medline ( Ovid ) databases from January 1 , 2013 , to February 28 , 2023 . Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( e.g. , moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment , peer - reviewed , moderate to severe depression , control / delayed treatment groups , and non - directive therapy during psilocybin sessions ) . Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists . Results : The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission ( e.g. , improved well - being and rumination scores , and decreased anxiety scores ) . Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single - dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses . A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin - induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms . Additionally , a dose - response relationship was found between moderate ( 15±5 mg/70 kg ) and high - dose psilocybin ( 25 ± 5 mg/70 kg ) , with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions . Discussion : This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD . Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression . The non - directive therapy approach during high - dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences , potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy . Reported side effects were minimal , and suggestions for future studies are provided . Conclusion : Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission , indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions .

25 ± 5 mg/70 kg	8795	high - dose psilocybin ( 25 ± 5 mg/70 kg ) , with greater improvements	"Psilocybin Therapy for Major Depressive Disorder : A Systematic Review.^ 
 Introduction : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is a prevalent and complex mood disorder . Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment - response times , while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects . In recent years , there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD . Therefore , this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate ( 15±5 mg/70 kg ) to high ( 25 ± 5 mg/70 kg ) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD . Methods : The review included a literature search using PubMed ( Medline ) , SCOPUS , Web of Science , and Medline ( Ovid ) databases from January 1 , 2013 , to February 28 , 2023 . Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria ( e.g. , moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment , peer - reviewed , moderate to severe depression , control / delayed treatment groups , and non - directive therapy during psilocybin sessions ) . Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists . Results : The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission ( e.g. , improved well - being and rumination scores , and decreased anxiety scores ) . Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single - dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses . A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin - induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms . Additionally , a dose - response relationship was found between moderate ( 15±5 mg/70 kg ) and high - dose psilocybin ( 25 ± 5 mg/70 kg ) , with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions .

0.5 mg kg(-1 )	5171	a single ketamine infusion ( 0.5 mg kg(-1 ) for 40 min ) .	"The role of adipokines in the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine.^ 
 We previously found that body mass index ( BMI ) strongly predicted response to ketamine . Adipokines have a key role in metabolism ( including BMI ) . They directly regulate inflammation and neuroplasticity pathways and also influence insulin sensitivity , bone metabolism and sympathetic outflow ; all of these have been implicated in mood disorders . Here , we sought to examine the role of three key adipokines - adiponectin , resistin and leptin - as potential predictors of response to ketamine or as possible transducers of its therapeutic effects . Eighty treatment - resistant subjects who met DSM - IV criteria for either major depressive disorder ( MDD ) or bipolar disorder I / II and who were currently experiencing a major depressive episode received a single ketamine infusion ( 0.5 mg kg(-1 ) for 40 min ) . Plasma adipokine levels were measured at three time points ( pre - infusion baseline , 230 min post infusion and day 1 post infusion ) . Overall improvement and response were assessed using percent change from baseline on the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale . Lower baseline levels of adiponectin significantly predicted ketamine 's antidepressant efficacy , suggesting an adverse metabolic state . Because adiponectin significantly improves insulin sensitivity and has potent anti - inflammatory effects , this finding suggests that specific systemic abnormalities might predict positive response to ketamine . A ketamine - induced decrease in resistin was also observed ; because resistin is a potent pro - inflammatory compound , this decrease suggests that ketamine 's anti - inflammatory effects may be transduced , in part , by its impact on resistin . Overall , the findings suggest that adipokines may either predict response to ketamine or have a role in its possible therapeutic effects ."
0.5 mg / kg	9182	received eight IV infusions of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine twice a week over	"Intravenous Ketamine Infusions in Treatment - Resistant Bipolar Depression : An Open - Label Naturalistic Observational Study.^ 
 PURPOSE : Bipolar disorder is a chronic and recurrent condition often associated with treatment resistance and suicidality . There is an unmet need for effective treatment in this group of patients . Ketamine has been demonstrated to have antidepressant and antisuicidal properties in unipolar depression . Most of the available studies concern unipolar depression . Here , we present the efficacy and safety of IV ketamine as an add - on treatment in patients with bipolar I and bipolar II depression . PATIENTS AND METHODS : Thirteen patients with treatment - resistant bipolar depression ( TRBD ) received eight IV infusions of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine twice a week over four weeks . This is an open - label naturalistic observational study . Ketamine is an add - on treatment . Depressive symptoms were measured with the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , and manic symptoms were measured with the Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) . Psychomimetic symptoms were assessed with the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) . RESULTS : The rates of response and remission after the seventh infusion of ketamine were 61.5 % and 46.2 % , respectively . A significant antisuicidal effect was observed in responders at the 7th infusion . Suicidality was measured with item 10 on the MADRS scale . The average time to respond was between 21.1 and 23.2 days to remission . There was an increase in the CADSS scores during the treatment compared to baseline and follow - up , but no differences between responders and non - responders were observed . No affective switch was observed according to the YMRS scale scores . Ketamine treatment was associated with a transient increase in arterial blood pressure . No serious adverse events , however , were observed . CONCLUSION : This report presents the preliminary results of IV ketamine effectiveness and safety in treatment - resistant bipolar depression . The findings suggest that it is a feasible , safe and well - tolerated treatment option in this group of patients . There is a definite need for more studies in this field ."
0.23 mg / kg	7186	pharmacological challenge ( racemic ketamine 0.23 mg / kg bolus over one min ;	"Attenuation of ketamine - induced impairment in verbal learning and memory in healthy volunteers by an AMPA receptor potentiator.^ 
 Background : Schizophrenia is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide . Current treatments do not fully address cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia ( CIAS ) . Several lines of evidence indicate that N‐methy‐ D‐aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) hypofunction may contribute to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia , and specifically to CIAS . One strategy to ameliorate NMDAR hypofunction is to stimulate alpha‐amino‐3‐hydroxy‐5‐ methyl‐4‐isoxazolepropionic acid receptors ( AMPAR ) . AMPAR opening depolarizes neuronal membranes to relieve the Mg2+block of colocalized NMDAR , which increases NMDAR‐mediated Ca2+gating that ultimately generates changes in the synaptic morphology and function thought to underlie learning and memory . Consistent with these theories , the AMPAR positive allosteric modulator ( “ potentiator ” ) PF‐04958242 attenuates spatial working memory deficits induced by the NMDAR antagonist ketamine in a rat radial arm maze task and a nonhuman primate spatial delayed response task . The primary aim of the reported study was to assess whether PF‐04958242 attenuated ketamine‐induced impairment in verbal learning and memory in healthy human volunteers . Secondary aims included assessing if PF‐04958242 modulated ketamineinduced impairments in working memory and spatial working memory and the clinical symptoms associated with ketamine . Methods : Healthy male subjects ( n=29 ) participated in this randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled , 2‐period , 2‐way crossover study . During each of the two periods in this study , subjects received a single oral loading dose of PF‐04958242 ( 0.35 mg ) or placebo on Day 1 . This was followed by a single daily dose of PF‐04958242 ( 0.25 mg ) or placebo for 4 subsequent days ( Day 2‐5).The effect of PF‐04958242 on ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment and associated subjective effects were assessed during a pharmacological challenge ( racemic ketamine 0.23 mg / kg bolus over one min ; and 0.58 mg / kg / hour for ∼ 70 min . ) 1 hour after PF‐ 04958242 or placebo administration on Day 5 . Subjects were housed on an inpatient unit from Day 0 ( pre‐dose ) to Day 6 ( post‐ketamine challenge ) of each test period . The two periods were separated by a 14‐day washout period . The cognitive battery consisted of the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test‐Revised ( HVLT‐R ) and tasks from the computerized test battery Cogstate . Ketamineinduced psychotomimetic effects were captured on a modified version of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) and the Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptom Scale ( CADSS ) . The primary efficacy endpoint , mean score of immediate recall trials 2 and 3 in HVLT R on Day 5 ( HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3 ) , was analyzed in subjects completing both treatment periods ( and without major protocol deviations ) with a linear crossover model including period , sequence , and treatment as fixed factors , baseline score as a continuous covariate , and subject as a random effect . Baseline was defined as the last pre‐dose measurement taken on Day 1 for each period separately . Results : A total of 29 subjects were randomized and 22 completed the study . The mean age of subjects was 33.9±6.8 years . The PF‐04958242 plasma exposures were within the expected range for testing the study hypotheses . Ketamine treatment resulted in a mean impairment of 2.96 words on the HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3 . Ketamine also induced transient psychotomimetic effects . Treatment with PF‐ 04958242 demonstrated a statistically significant attenuation of ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment , resulting in placebo‐adjusted mean reduction in ketamine‐induced impairment of 0.58 words on HVLT‐R‐IR2‐3 with a 2‐sided 90 % confidence interval ( CI ) of ( 0.04 , 1.12 ) words . In exploratory analyses of secondary endpoints , PF‐04958242 attenuated ketamine mediated impairment on the 2‐back and spatial working memory tasks , but not on the 1‐back task or one card learning task . There were no differences in PF‐04958242 vs. placebo on ketamine‐induced PANSS or CADSS scores Overall , PF‐04958242 was well tolerated with no serious adverse events . The most common adverse events ( AEs ) attributed to PF‐04958242 were mild gastrointestinal disorders . Non‐treatment‐related AEs were consistent with the well‐known AE profile of ketamine and were observed evenly across PF‐04958242 and placebo groups . Conclusions : Treatment with PF‐04958242 for 5 days significantly attenuated the ketamine‐induced cognitive impairment in verbal learning and memory ( HVLT‐R‐IR2‐ 3 ) in healthy volunteers , and resulted in similar effects on working memory tasks in exploratory analyses . These results suggest clinical translation of the findings with PF‐ 04958242 in rat and nonhuman primate models of ketamine‐mediated cognitive disruption . PF‐04958242 was well tolerated , consistent with prior clinical studies , and did not appear to exhibit any consistent differences in its safety profile in combination with ketamine ."
100 mg	2227	MDMA was given orally ( 100 mg ) and blood alcohol concentration	"Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol ( co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^ 
 RATIONALE : In Western societies , a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or "" ecstasy "" ) . Commonly , ecstasy is used in combination with other substances , in particular alcohol ( ethanol ) . MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects , whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant . OBJECTIVE : The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co - administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive , memory , psychomotor , visuomotor , visuospatial and attention function , as well as on subjective experience . MATERIALS AND METHODS : We performed a four - way , double - blind , randomised , crossover , placebo - controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers ( nine male , seven female ) between the ages of 18 - 29 . MDMA was given orally ( 100 mg ) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime . RESULTS : Co - administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single - drug conditions . Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions , whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions . CONCLUSIONS : Co - administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone . Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate , all induced significant impairment of cognitive function ."

 BACKGROUND : Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients . When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication , children tend to awaken when separated from their parents , and body movements occur during invasive procedures . We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients , while producing minimal adverse events . METHODS : A total of 135 children , aged 2 - 5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I - II , scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg / kg ( group D ) , oral ketamine 3 mg / kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg / kg ( group DK ) , or oral ketamine 6 mg / kg ( group K ) 30 min before surgery . Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation . Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively . The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation . RESULTS : The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47 % with dexmedetomidine alone , 68 % with ketamine alone , and 80 % with combined premedication ( P = 0.006 ) . The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups . The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups ( postoperative vomiting , P = 0.0041 ; respiratory - related complications during the perioperative period , P = 0.0032 ; and postoperative psychological / psychiatric adverse events , P = 0.0152 ) . CONCLUSION : The combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg / kg and oral ketamine 3 mg / kg produces satisfactory separation from parents and more successful venous cannulation , allowing children to smoothly accept induction of general anesthesia .

3 mg / kg	7113	/ kg and oral ketamine 3 mg / kg produces satisfactory separation from parents	"Pediatric premedication : a double - blind randomized trial of dexmedetomidine or ketamine alone versus a combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Preoperative anxiety is common in pediatric patients . When dexmedetomidine is used alone for sedation as premedication , children tend to awaken when separated from their parents , and body movements occur during invasive procedures . We tested the hypothesis that the combination of dexmedetomidine and ketamine may be a useful premedication to alleviate preoperative anxiety and improve cooperation during intravenous cannulation in pediatric patients , while producing minimal adverse events . METHODS : A total of 135 children , aged 2 - 5 years and American Society of Anesthesiologists status I - II , scheduled for eye surgery were randomly allocated to receive intranasal dexmedetomidine 2.5 μg / kg ( group D ) , oral ketamine 3 mg / kg and intranasal dexmedetomidine 2 μg / kg ( group DK ) , or oral ketamine 6 mg / kg ( group K ) 30 min before surgery . Sedation state was evaluated every 10 min after premedication and emotional state was assessed during separation from their parents and peripheral intravenous cannulation . Adverse events were recorded for 24 h postoperatively . The primary endpoint was the rate of successful intravenous cannulation . RESULTS : The rate of successful venous cannulation was 47 % with dexmedetomidine alone , 68 % with ketamine alone , and 80 % with combined premedication ( P = 0.006 ) . The rate of satisfactory separation from parents was not different among groups . The incidence of adverse events was higher in group K compared with the other two groups ( postoperative vomiting , P = 0.0041 ; respiratory - related complications during the perioperative period , P = 0.0032 ; and postoperative psychological / psychiatric adverse events , P = 0.0152 ) .

0.5 mg / kg	9570	intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . Post hoc analyses	"Antianhedonic effects of serial intravenous subanaesthetic ketamine in anxious versus nonanxious depression.^ 
 Objectives : Patents with anxious depression have poor treatment outcomes compared to their nonanxious counterparts . Ketamine has a rapid and robust antianhedonic effect , independent of depressive symptoms . The difference in the antianhedonic effect of ketamine between patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression remains unknown . Methods : One hundred thirty - five Chinese individuals with anxious depression ( n = 92 ) and nonanxious depression ( n = 43 ) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . Post hoc analyses compared changes in anhedonic symptoms , as measured by the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , between patients with anxious depression ( defined by a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety - Somatization score ≥7 ) and nonanxious depression . Results : In this study , 68.1 % of patients were found to have anxious depression . Anxious depressed patients were associated with a relatively lower antianhedonic response ( 47.8 % versus 51.2 % , p > 0.05 ) and remission ( 17.4 % versus 27.9 % , p > 0.05 ) than their nonanxious counterparts . When compared to baseline , a significant reduction in anhedonic symptoms was observed from the first infusion to the last infusion and 2 - week follow - up in both groups ( all p < 0.05 ) . A linear mixed model did not find a significant group main effect on the MADRS anhedonia subscale scores ( F = 0.5 , p = 0.46 ) . Conclusion : This preliminary study shows that repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine rapidly ameliorate anhedonic symptoms in individuals experiencing anxious depression , but these individuals displayed a weaker antianhedonic response to ketamine than nonanxious depressed patients .

 The effects of the indolehallucinogen psilocybin , a mixed 5 - HT2 and 5 - HT1 agonist , on regional cerebral glucose metabolism were investigated in 10 healthy volunteers with PET and [ F-18]-fluorodeoxyglucose ( FDG ) prior to and following a 15- or 20 - mg dose of psilocybin . Psychotomimetic doses of psilocybin were found to produce a global increase in cerebral metabolic rate of glucose ( CMRglu ) with significant and most marked increases in the frontomedial and frontolateral cortex ( 24.3 % ) , anterior cingulate ( 24.9 % ) , and temporomedial cortex ( 25.3 % ) . Somewhat smaller increases of CMRglu were found in the basal ganglia ( 18.5 % ) , and the smallest increases were found in the sensorimotor ( 14.7 % ) and occipital cortex ( 14.4 % ) . The increases of CMRglu in the prefrontal cortex , anterior cingulate , temporomedial cortex , and putamen correlated positively with psychotic symptom formation , in particular with hallucinatory ego disintegration . The present data suggest that excessive 5 - HT2 receptor activation results in a hyperfrontal metablic pattern that parallels comparable metabolic findings associated with acute psychotic episodes in chronic schizophrenics and contrasts with the hypofrontality in chronic schizophrenic patients ."

 The psychological effects of LSD were accidentally discovered at the Sandoz Laboratories by the chemist , A. Hofmann , in 1943 ( 13 ) . Recognizing the importance of LSD as a tool in experimental psychiatry , we introduced it to the United States in 1949 , and at the Massachusetts Mental Health Center ( Boston Psychopathic Hospital ) , at the suggestion of Dr. Harry C. Solomon , designed an experimental research project ( 5 , 7 , 14 , 15 , 16 , 17 , 18 , 19 , 20 , 21 , 22 , 26 ) . With many and various controls , experimental studies were done on 100 normal volunteers ( male and female ) who received LSD by mouth , usually in the amount of one microgram per kilogram body weight . In some instances less , in a few more , was given . Included in the study were also a few psychotic patients , and one female patient who was to undergo lobotomy because of a psychotic illness . The volunteers , after having received LSD , were at first clinically observed , individually , in a hospital room with daylight , which excluded partial sensory restriction in a darkened room . Later , Dr. Hyde and his associates used sociological techniques to study the behavior of LSD volunteers in a group or among psychotic hospital patients ( 10 , 23 ) . Neurological signs were recorded whenever they occurred ; the autonomic nervous system was systematically examined by pharmacological techniques and the use of the polygraph ; verbalizations were often recorded by tape or wire recording machines . In general , the LSD - induced mental manifestations seemed to be similar to those observed in the acute schizophrenic turmoil state . Specifically outstanding were dissociation of thought processes , inappropriate affect and catatonic features . Disturbances in the functions of the autonomic nervous system were present in all LSD subjects . ( PsycInfo Database Record ( c ) 2022 APA , all rights reserved )"

 OBJECTIVE : It has been proposed that the thalamocortical system is an important site of action of hallucinogenic drugs and an essential component of the neural correlates of consciousness . Hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD can be used to induce profoundly altered states of consciousness , and it is thus of interest to test the effects of these drugs on this system . METHOD : 100 μg LSD was administrated orally to 20 healthy participants prior to fMRI assessment . Whole brain thalamic functional connectivity was measured using ROI - to - ROI and ROI - to - voxel approaches . Correlation analyses were used to explore relationships between thalamic connectivity to regions involved in auditory and visual hallucinations and subjective ratings on auditory and visual drug effects . RESULTS : LSD caused significant alterations in all dimensions of the 5D - ASC scale and significantly increased thalamic functional connectivity to various cortical regions . Furthermore , LSD - induced functional connectivity measures between the thalamus and the right fusiform gyrus and insula correlated significantly with subjective auditory and visual drug effects . CONCLUSION : Hallucinogenic drug effects might be provoked by facilitations of cortical excitability via thalamocortical interactions . Our findings have implications for the understanding of the mechanism of action of hallucinogenic drugs and provide further insight into the role of the 5 - HT(2A ) -receptor in altered states of consciousness ."

 The glutamate N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( TRD ) within 24 h of a single dose . The current study utilized functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) and two separate emotion perception tasks to examine the neural effects of ketamine in patients with TRD . One task used happy and neutral facial expressions ; the other used sad and neutral facial expressions . Twenty patients with TRD free of concomitant antidepressant medication underwent fMRI at baseline and 24 h following administration of a single intravenous dose of ketamine ( 0.5 mg kg(-1 ) ) . Adequate data were available for 18 patients for each task . Twenty age- and sex - matched healthy volunteers were scanned at one time point for baseline comparison . Whole - brain , voxel - wise analyses were conducted controlling for a family - wise error rate ( FWE ) of P<0.05 . Compared with healthy volunteers , TRD patients showed reduced neural responses to positive faces within the right caudate . Following ketamine , neural responses to positive faces were selectively increased within a similar region of right caudate . Connectivity analyses showed that greater connectivity of the right caudate during positive emotion perception was associated with improvement in depression severity following ketamine . No main effect of group was observed for the sad faces task . Our results indicate that ketamine specifically enhances neural responses to positive emotion within the right caudate in depressed individuals in a pattern that appears to reverse baseline deficits and that connectivity of this region may be important for the antidepressant effects of ketamine ."

 This paper describes the results of a clinical study exploring the potential of a complex program of psychedelic therapy to alleviate the emotional and physical suffering of terminal cancer patients . A total of 50 cancer patients participated in this experimental treatment program , in which two psychedelic compounds were used as an adjunct to a brief course of intensive psychotherapy . In 40 of of these patients LSD was used perorally in dosages from 200 to 500 mcg , in 7 of these patients dipropyltryptamine ( DPT ) was administered intramuscularly in doses ranging from 60 to 105 mg . These patients received both LSD and DPT on different occasions . The therapeutic results were assessed by means of a clinical rating scale reflecting the degree of the patient 's depression , psychological isolation , anxiety , difficulty in management , acceptance of imminent death , fear of death and pain . The ratings were made by attending physicians , nurses , family members , LSD therapists and co therapists . In addition , the amount of physical pain and/or pain tolerance was assessed on the basis of the amount of narcotics required in the management of the patient . The comparison of the means of individual ratings from pre to post treatment showed significant improvement in all the measured parameters for most of the raters . There was a definite trend toward reduction of the narcotic medication ; it did not , however , reach the level of statistical significance . The pre to post treatment comparison of the Global Indexes grossly expressing the degree of emotional and physical distress indicated that approximately 36 % of the patients were dramatically improved , 36 % moderately improved and 19 % essentially unchanged .

 Background : Several small , single‐site studies or case series in unipolar and bipolar depression have suggested that ketamine ‐ A glutamatergic NMDA receptor antagonist ‐ may be associated with a rapid antidepressant effect . Previous controlled trials of intravenous ( IV ) ketamine utilized cross‐over designs with saline as the control condition . This methodological feature has raised concerns over the quality of the blind , given ketamine 's well known psychoactive effects , and consequently has limited our ability to draw firm conclusions regarding the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine . In the current study the investigators have conducted a two‐site , randomized , controlled , parallel‐arm clinical trial of IV ketamine versus IV midazolam in treatment‐resistant unipolar major depression ( TRD ) . Midazolam ‐ A short‐acting , water soluble benzodiazepine ‐ was selected as an “ active ” control condition due to its potential to mimic many of the transient psychoactive effects associated with ketamine . Here we report topline results from the largest clinical trial of ketamine in major depression conducted to date . Methods : Following a washout of concomitant antidepressants or other psychotropic medication , 73 patients , ages 21‐80 , with unipolar major depressive disorder , without psychotic features , and moderate‐to‐severe depressive symptoms ( IDS ≥ 32 ) , were eligible for randomization . All patients were treatment‐resistant , defined as a failure to response to at least three antidepressant trials with adequate doses and duration . Patients were randomized to receive a single 40‐minute IV infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ) in a 2:1 randomization scheme . 72 individuals comprised the intent‐to‐treat ( ITT ) sample and received study drug under triple‐blind conditions under the supervision of an anesthesiologist masked to drug identity along with the patient and rater . Patients were discharged 24 hours following the infusion , and received follow‐up outpatient evaluations at 48 hr , 72 hr , and 7 days post‐infusion , while remaining antidepressant medication‐free . The primary outcome was change in MADRS score from baseline to 24 hours post‐infusion and proportion of participants meeting response criteria at 24 hours , defined as ≥ 50 % reduction in MADRS score . Secondary outcomes included the ( 1 ) durability of antidepressant benefit over the subsequent 7‐day interval and ( 2 ) safety and tolerability of the interventions . Results : 52 % of the ITT sample was female with a mean age was 45.5±12.4 years . On average , patients had been ill for more than 20 years with an age of onset of the first major depressive episode of 21.0±9.6 years and a length of current episode of 11.7±13.4 years . Nearly one in three patients had experienced a prior suicide attempt ( 32.9 % ) . The baseline IDS‐C30 and MADRS scores were 48.1±9.0 and 32.07±5.9 , respectively . After controlling for site differences , treatment , and time , a treatment x time interaction demonstrated differential change for the two groups over the first 24 h period ( F(1,70)=9.62 , p≤0.003 ) . Ketamine demonstrated a 16.5 point decrease ( t(46)=‐10.31 , p≤0.0001 ) on the MADRS while midazolam showed an 8.8 point decrease ( t(24)=‐4.63 , p≤0.0001 ) . At 24 hours post‐infusion , the response rate in the ketamine arm was 63.8 % , compared to 28.0 % in the midazolam arm ( p=0.006 ) . Controlling for site differences , ketamine increased the odds of responding by a factor of 2.16 ( 95 % CI 1.31‐4.09 ) . The remission rate at 24 hours in the ketamine arm was 36.2 % , compared to 8.0 % in the midazolam arm ( p≤0.011 ) . Controlling for site differences , ketamine increased the odds of remitting by a factor of 2.58 ( 95 % CI 1.15‐8.14 ) . At Day 7 , the response rate in the ketamine arm was 45.7 % , compared to 18.2 % in the midazolam arm ( p≤0.034 ) . After controlling for site differences , ketamine increased the odds of responding by a factor of 1.97 ( 95 % CI 1.01‐4.34 ) . Remission rate at Day 7 was 34.8 % and 18.2 % for keta ine and midazolam respectively ( p≤0.26 ) . Controlling for site , ketamine increased the odds of remission by a factor of 1.93 ( 95 % CI 0.94‐4.79 ) relative to midazolam . Both study drugs were well‐tolerated ; ketamine was associated with a higher incidence of elevations in blood pressure compared to midazolam during the infusion period . Conclusions : In the largest clinical trial testing the efficacy of IV ketamine in mood disorders conducted to date , ketamine was associated with a rapid and large antidepressant effect at 24 hours , significantly superior to midazolam , and this superior efficacy was maintained seven days post‐infusion . Ketamine appears to possess rapid antidepressant effects independent of its transient psychoactive effects ‐ a conclusion validated by the novel use of midazolam as an active control condition in this study . Hemodynamic alterations associated with ketamine were observed in some patients , emphasizing the importance of appropriate cardiorespiratory monitoring during this procedure ."

 RATIONALE : Aberrant prefrontal - hippocampal ( PFC - HC ) connectivity is disrupted in several psychiatric and at - risk conditions . Advances in rodent functional imaging have opened the possibility that this phenotype could serve as a translational imaging marker for psychiatric research . Recent evidence from functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) studies has indicated an increase in PFC - HC coupling during working - memory tasks in both schizophrenic patients and at - risk populations , in contrast to a decrease in resting - state PFC - HC connectivity . Acute ketamine challenge is widely used in both humans and rats as a pharmacological model to study the mechanisms of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor hypofunction in the context of psychiatric disorders . OBJECTIVES : We aimed to establish whether acute ketamine challenge has consistent effects in rats and humans by investigating resting - state fMRI PFC - HC connectivity and thus to corroborate its potential utility as a translational probe . METHODS : Twenty - four healthy human subjects ( 12 females , mean age 25 years ) received intravenous doses of either saline ( placebo ) or ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg body weight ) . Eighteen Sprague - Dawley male rats received either saline or ketamine ( 25 mg / kg ) . Resting - state fMRI measurements took place after injections , and the data were analyzed for PFC - HC functional connectivity . RESULTS : In both species , ketamine induced a robust increase in PFC - HC coupling , in contrast to findings in chronic schizophrenia . CONCLUSIONS : This translational comparison demonstrates a cross - species consistency in pharmacological effect and elucidates ketamine - induced alterations in PFC - HC coupling , a phenotype often disrupted in pathological conditions , which may give clue to understanding of psychiatric disorders and their onset , and help in the development of new treatments ."

 BACKGROUND : The influence of psychoactive drugs on the central nervous system has been investigated with positron emission tomography and task - related functional magnetic resonance imaging . However , it is not known how these drugs affect the intrinsic large - scale interactions of the brain ( resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging connectivity ) . In this study , the effect of low - dose S(+)-ketamine on intrinsic brain connectivity was investigated . METHODS : Twelve healthy , male volunteers received a 2 - h intravenous S(+)-ketamine infusion ( first hour 20 mg/70 kg , second hour 40 mg/70 kg ) . Before , during , and after S(+)-ketamine administration , resting - state brain connectivity was measured . In addition , heat pain tests were performed between imaging sessions to determine ketamine - induced analgesia . A mixed - effects general linear model was used to determine drug and pain effects on resting - state brain connectivity . RESULTS : Ketamine increased the connectivity most importantly in the cerebellum and visual cortex in relation to the medial visual network . A decrease in connectivity was observed in the auditory and somatosensory network in relation to regions responsible for pain sensing and the affective processing of pain , which included the amygdala , insula , and anterior cingulate cortex . Connectivity variations related to fluctuations in pain scores were observed in the anterior cingulate cortex , insula , orbitofrontal cortex , and the brainstem , regions involved in descending inhibition of pain . CONCLUSIONS : Changes in connectivity were observed in the areas that explain ketamine 's pharmacodynamic profile with respect to analgesia and psychedelic and other side effects .

 Patients receiving ketamine for refractory depression and anxiety report dissociative symptoms in the first 60 min post - dose . The most commonly used instrument to assess this is the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) , developed based on the assessment of patients with dissociative symptoms . Its psychometric properties for ketamine - induced dissociation have not been reported . We evaluated these from a study using 0.25 - 1 mg / kg ketamine and midazolam ( as an active control ) in 18 patients with treatment - resistant anxiety . Dissociation ratings were increased by ketamine in a dose - dependent manner . In contrast , midazolam showed no effect on ratings of dissociation . For individual CADSS items , the magnitude of change and the ketamine dose at which changes were observed were not homogenous . The Cronbach alpha for the total scale was high ( 0.937 ) , with acceptable item - rest correlations for almost all individual items . Purposefully removing items to maximise alpha did not lead to meaningful improvements . Acceptable internal consistency was still observed after removing items which lacked evidence of responsiveness at lower doses . The high Cronbach alpha values identified in this study suggests that the CADSS is an internally consistent instrument for evaluating ketamine - induced dissociation in clinical trials in anxiety , although it does not capture symptoms such as thought disorder ."

 OBJECTIVES : Fear of Harm ( FOH ) is a pediatric onset phenotype of bipolar disorder ( BD ) characterized by BD plus treatment resistance , separation anxiety , aggressive obsessions , parasomnias , and thermal dysregulation . Intranasal ketamine ( InK ) in 12 youths with BD - FOH produced marked improvement during a two - week trial . Here we report on the open effectiveness and safety of InK in maintenance treatment of BD - FOH from the private practice of one author . METHODS : As part of a chart review , patients 18 years or older and parents of younger children responded to a clinical effectiveness and safety survey . Effectiveness was assessed from analysis of responses to 49 questions on symptomatology plus qualitative content analyses of written reports and chart review . Adverse events ( AEs ) were analyzed by frequency , duration and severity . Peak InK doses ranged from 20 to 360 mg per administration . RESULTS : Surveys were completed on 45 patients treated with InK for 3 months to 6.5 years . Almost all patients were "" much "" to "" very much "" improved clinically and in ratings of social function and academic performance . Significant reductions were reported in all symptom categories . There were 13 reports of persistent AEs , none of which resulted in discontinuation . Acute emergence reactions were sporadically observed in up to 75 % , but were mild and of brief duration . LIMITATIONS : Retrospective review from a single practice without placebo control with potential for response and recall bias . CONCLUSIONS : InK every 3 - 4 days at sub - anesthetic doses appeared to be a beneficial and well - tolerated treatment . Use of InK may be considered as a tertiary alternative in treatment refractory cases . Randomized control trials are warranted ."

0.5 mg / kg	9596	of 741 ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) .	"Cardiovascular effects of repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusion in depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine produces significant rapid - onset and robust antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder . However , this drug also has transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects , and there are limited data about potential predictors of these cardiovascular effects . METHODS : A total of 135 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression received a total of 741 ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) . Blood pressure and pulse were monitored every 10 min during the infusions and 30 min after the infusions . Depressive , psychotomimetic and dissociative symptom severity was assessed at baseline and 4 hours after each infusion . RESULTS : The maximum blood pressure and pulse values were observed at 30 - 40 min during infusions . The largest mean systolic / diastolic blood pressure increases were 7.4/6.0 mmHg , and the largest mean pulse increase was 1.9 beats per min . No significant change in blood pressure and pulse was found in the second to sixth infusions compared with the first infusion . Patients who were older ( age⩾50 years ) , hypertensive and receiving infusions while exhibiting dissociative symptoms showed greater maximal changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure than patients who were younger ( age<50 years ) , normotensive and without dissociative symptoms ( all p < 0.05 ) . Hypertensive patients had less elevation of pulse than normotensive patients ( p < 0.05 ) . Ketamine dosage was positively correlated with changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure ( all p < 0.05 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Blood pressure and pulse elevations following subanaesthetic ketamine infusions are transient and do not cause serious cardiovascular events . Older age , hypertension , large ketamine dosage and dissociative symptoms may predict increased ketamine - induced cardiovascular effects ."

 BACKGROUND : Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer , and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes . Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer - related anxiety and depression . METHODS : In this double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover trial , 29 patients with cancer - related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single - dose psilocybin ( 0.3 mg / kg ) or niacin , both in conjunction with psychotherapy . The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks . RESULTS : Prior to the crossover , psilocybin produced immediate , substantial , and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer - related demoralization and hopelessness , improved spiritual wellbeing , and increased quality of life . At the 6.5 - month follow - up , psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti - depressant effects ( approximately 60 - 80 % of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety ) , sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life , as well as improved attitudes towards death . The psilocybin - induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression . CONCLUSIONS : In conjunction with psychotherapy , single moderate - dose psilocybin produced rapid , robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti - depressant effects in patients with cancer - related psychological distress .

0.5mg / kg	7941	completed six IV infusions of 0.5mg / kg ketamine over 40min on a	"Augmentation of response and remission to serial intravenous subanesthetic ketamine in treatment resistant depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine has been showing high efficacy and rapid antidepressant effect . However , studies of ketamine infusion wash subjects out from prior antidepressants , which may be impractical in routine practice . In this study , we determined antidepressant response and remission to six consecutive ketamine infusions while maintaining stable doses of antidepressant regimen . We also examined the trajectory of response and remission , and the time to relapse among responders . METHODS : TRD subjects had at least 2 - month period of stable dose of antidepressants . Subjects completed six IV infusions of 0.5mg / kg ketamine over 40min on a Monday - Wednesday - Friday schedule during a 12 - day period participants meeting response criteria were monitored for relapse for 4 weeks . RESULTS : Fourteen subjects were enrolled . Out of twelve subjects who completed all six infusions , eleven ( 91.6 % ) achieved response criterion while eight ( 66.6 % ) remitted . After the first infusion , only three and one out of twelve subjects responded and remitted , respectively . Four achieved response and six remitted after 3 or more infusions . Five out of eleven subjects remain in response status throughout the 4 weeks of follow - up . The mean time for six subjects who relapsed was 16 days . LIMITATIONS : Small sample and lack of a placebo group limits the interpretation of efficacy . CONCLUSIONS : Safety and efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions were attained without medication - free state in patients with TRD . Repeated infusions achieved superior antidepressant outcomes as compared to a single infusion with different trajectories of response and remission . Future studies are needed to elucidate neural circuits involved in treatment response to ketamine ."
80‐160 mg	6262	dosing sessions with MDMA ( 80‐160 mg ) or placebo .	"A Randomised , Controlled Trial of MDMA - assisted Prolonged Exposure Therapy for Comorbid Alcohol Use Disorder and Post - traumatic Stress Disorder.^ 
 We urgently require new strategies for the treatment of comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence . Recent evidence has shown strong support for trauma‐focused integrated treatments ( namely COPE ) , however only 49 % demonstrate clinically significant improvements . MDMA may be a promising approach to improve response to COPE for this population . Emerging evidence suggests that MDMA‐assisted therapy may be of promise for PTSD , and has demonstrated a good safety profile and potential efficacy in alcohol dependence . This project will evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of MDMA‐assisted COPE relative to a placebo‐assisted COPE . We hypothesise that MDMA treated patients will be have a reduction in PTSD symptom severity as well as heavy drinking . We will utilise a double blind , randomised , controlled design . A sample of 120 individuals will receive 14 weeks of treatment including 12 COPE sessions and 2 dosing sessions with MDMA ( 80‐160 mg ) or placebo ."
56 or 84 mg	7011	to flexibly‐dosed intranasal esketamine ( 56 or 84 mg twice weekly ) and a	"Randomized , double - blind study of flexibly - dosed intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant vs. active control in treatment - resistant depression.^ 
 Background : About 30 % of the patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) fail to achieve remission despite treatment with multiple antidepressant medications , and are considered to have treatment‐resistant depression ( TRD ) . New treatment options for TRD patients are needed . Aim : To evaluate the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of switching adult patients with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment ( to which they had not responded ) to intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant ( active comparator ) plus intranasal placebo , in improving depressive symptoms . Methods : This was a Phase 3 , double‐blind , active‐controlled , multicenter study ( NCT02418585 ) using blinded raters , conducted at 39 sites in Spain , Germany , Czech Republic , Poland , and the United States from August 2015 to June 2017 . The study enrolled adults with moderate‐to‐severe , non‐psychotic , recurrent or persistent ( single episode ) depression , and history of non‐response to ≥2 antidepressants in the current episode of depression , with 1 of them assessed prospectively . The non‐responders to standard‐of‐care treatment were randomized ( 1:1 ) to flexibly‐dosed intranasal esketamine ( 56 or 84 mg twice weekly ) and a new oral antidepressant ( given daily ) or to a new oral antidepressant and intranasal placebo . The primary efficacy endpoint – change from baseline to endpoint ( day 28 ) in Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score – was assessed among patients who received ≥1 dose of ( intranasal and oral ) study medication by a mixed‐effects model using repeated measures . Remission rate , a secondary endpoint , was assessed using Generalized Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel ( CMH ) test , adjusting for country and class of oral antidepressant ( SNRI or SSRI ) as a post hoc analysis . Results : 435 patients were screened , 227 randomized , and 197 completed the double‐blind period . Change ( LS mean [ SE ] difference vs. placebo ) in MADRS total score with intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant was superior to oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo at day 28 ( ‐4.0 [ 1.69 ] , 95 % CI : ‐7.31 , ‐0.64 ; 1‐sided p=0.010 ) , as well as at earlier timepoints ( 1‐sided p≤0.009 at 24 hours postdose and days 8 and 22 ) . Remission rate ( MADRS total score ≤12 ) at day 28 was 52.5 % ( 53/101 ) and 31.0 % ( 31/100 ) for the respective groups ( 1‐sided p=0.001 ) , with the number needed to treat ( NNT ) ( 95 % CI ) for remission of 5 ( 1.8 ; 7.5 ) . The most common adverse events reported for the esketamine plus oral antidepressant group were dysgeusia , nausea , vertigo , and dizziness ; the incidence of each ( 20.9‐26.1 % ) was > 2‐fold higher than for the oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo group . Conclusions : Robust efficacy of intranasal esketamine and superiority to an active comparator were demonstrated on the primary efficacy endpoint result . More than half of the esketamine‐treated TRD patients achieved remission by the 4‐week endpoint . Favorable safety and tolerability of intranasal esketamine reported in this study suggest a positive risk‐benefit profile of intranasal esketamine .

100 mg	2223	and 29 . MDMA ( 100 mg ) was given orally while	"Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol ( co- ) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^ 
 In Western societies , a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or ' ecstasy ' ) . The use of alcohol ( ethanol ) in combination with ecstasy is common . The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of ( co- ) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics . We performed a four - way , double blind , randomized , crossover , placebo - controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers ( nine men , seven women ) between the ages of 18 and 29 . MDMA ( 100 mg ) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo - steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10 % intravenous ethanol clamp . MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal . Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation . Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol - induced sedation . Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90 - 150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration , with the exception of ethanol - induced sedation , which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped . In conclusion , results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo , but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired . These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy ."

In this randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled single ascending - dose study , we evaluated the safety , tolerability , and pharmacokinetics of noribogaine in 27 patients seeking to discontinue methadone OST who had been switched to morphine during the previous week . Noribogaine doses were 60 , 120 , or 180 mg ( n = 6 / dose level ) or matching placebo ( n = 3 / dose level ) . Noribogaine was well tolerated . The most frequent treatment - emergent adverse events were noneuphoric changes in light perception ∼1 hour postdose , headache , and nausea . Noribogaine had dose - linear increases for AUC and C(max ) and was slowly eliminated ( mean t(1/2 ) range , 24 - 30 hours ) .

0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 μg	4633	four oral LSD doses ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 μg , LSD base ) given	"Creative processes under the influence of a low dose of LSD : a placebo - controlled , double - blind trial in healthy volunteers.^ 
 Background : Previously scientific studies have shown the potential of psychedelics in full hallucinogenic doses to change creativity , with enhancing effects on divergent thinking specifically while under the influence of the substance . This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context , in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns , like depression . Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small , sub‐hallucinogenic doses ( microdosing ) might improve creativity , and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms . While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce , we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study . Methods : The study was conducted according to a doubleblind , randomized , placebo‐controlled , within‐subject design with four oral LSD doses ( 0 , 5 , 10 , and 20 μg , LSD base ) given on four separate test days , with minimally five days of washout in between . LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 μg LSD base in 1mL ethanol ( 96 % ) which resulted in 0.2 , 0.4 , and 0.8 mL LSD , for 5 , 10 , and 20 μg LSD . Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe . To mask the treatment condition , ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume . Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only ( 96 % ) . Participants were 24 healthy males ( N = 12 ) and females ( N = 12 ) aged 22.75 on average ( SD = 2.97 ) . All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs . Task‐based creativity was assessed three hours post‐treatment with the Alternate Uses Task ( AUT ) and five hours post‐treatment with the Story Writing task . In the latter participants were asked to write a ( non)‐fictive story around two given words . To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story , two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score . The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking . Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters . Dependent outcome variables are Fluency , Originality , the ratio of Fluency and Originality , Flexibility , and Elaboration . Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days . In addition , the participant selfrated how creative s / he felt on a visual analogue scale ( VAS ) . This was done eleven times during the test day , and daily , up to four days after treatment administration . Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations . The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments , which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers ( World‐Medical‐ Association , 2013 ) . A permit for obtaining , storing , and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration . The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register ( NTR7102 ) . All data entered SPSS version 24.0 , where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures ( GLM RM ) Analysis of Variance ( ANOVA ) was run on data of the AUT , the Story Writing Task , and the VAS . LSD ( four levels ) was included as a within‐subject factor ; additional within‐subject factors were Time ( ten levels ) or Day ( four levels ) for the VASs . In the case of a main LSD or Time effect , Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category . Partial eta squared ( partial η2 ) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude , and it is based on Cohen 's f , which defines small , medium , and large as respectively 0.10 , 0.25 , and 0.50 , which corresponds to partial η2 values of 0.01 , 0.06 , and 0.14 . Results : GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency ( F3,69 = 0.65 , p = 0.59 , partial η2 = 0.03 ) , Elaboration ( F3,69 = 0.09 , p = 0.99 , partial η2 = 0.004 ) , Flexibility ( F3,69 = 2.30 , p = 0.08 , partial η2 = 0.09 ) , Originality ( F3,69 = 0.28 , p = 0.84 , partial η2 = 0.01 ) , and Ra io ( F3,66 = 0.17 , p = 0.92 , partial η2 = 0.01 ) . RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect ( F3,69 = 1.31 , p = 0.28 , partial η2 = 0.05 ) on rater‐scored Creativity which was 2.76 ( 0.22 ) on average ( SEM ) on a scale from zero to five . GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD ( F3,57 = 1.22 , p = 0.31 , partial η2 = 0.06 ) or Day ( F3,57 = 0.14 , p = 0.93 , partial η2 = 0.008 ) , or their interaction ( F9,171 = 1.03 , p = 0.42 , partial η2 = 0.05 ) on the self‐rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration . At 3 hours post‐administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean ( SD ) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 ( 32 ) , 212 ( 70 ) , and 391 ( 146 ) pg / mL after LSD 5 , 10 , and 20 μg , respectively . Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration , when the Story Writing Task was performed , were 69 ( 21 ) , 137 ( 57 ) , and 258 ( 112 ) pg / mL after the 5 , 10 , and 20 μg dose , respectively . Conclusions : Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users , the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task‐based or self‐rated creative thinking . Nonetheless , findings stimulate further research in a placebo‐controlled setting , and eventually in patient populations , to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration , closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations , or after repeated administrations ."

84 mg	1238	) to intranasal ESK ( 84 mg ) or intranasal placebo ,	"Efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of symptoms of major depressive disorder , including suicidal ideation , in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide : a proof - ofconcept study.^ 
 Background : Patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have an increased risk of suicide that is 20 times greater than that of general population . The standard of care ( SoC ) for patients with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide includes hospitalization and treatment with conventional antidepressants for underlying depression . However , hospitalizations are temporary and do not eliminate the risk of suicide , and conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapies show a delayed onset of action that limits their utility in treating vulnerable patients . Recent clinical studies of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and one of its active isomers , esketamine ( ESK ) , have suggested rapid onset of antidepressant action . In addition , preliminary studies of intravenous ketamine demonstrated rapid reduction of suicidal ideation ( SI ) in patients with MDD . Intranasal ESK is currently in development for the rapid reduction in symptoms of MDD , including SI , in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Methods : The PeRSEVERe trial was a randomized , doubleblind ( DB ) , placebo‐controlled , multicenter , phase 2 , proofof‐concept study . Eligible patients ( aged 18 to 64 years ) who met the inclusion criteria of having a DSM‐IV diagnosis of MDD as well as active SI and intent as confirmed by the Mini International Psychiatric Interview ( MINI ) and of being in need of acute psychiatric hospitalization , were enrolled . The study consisted of a screening phase ( 24 to 48 hours ) , a DB treatment phase ( day 1 to 25 ) , wherein patients were randomized ( 1:1 ) to intranasal ESK ( 84 mg ) or intranasal placebo , administered 2 times / week , and a post‐treatment follow‐up phase ( day 26 to 81 ) . All patients received SoC treatment , including hospitalization and oral antidepressants . The primary endpoint for ESK 84 mg+SoC ( ESK 84 mg ) vs placebo+SoC ( placebo ) was change from baseline ( day 1 , predose ) to 4 hours postdose on day 1 in MADRS total score . Secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to day 2 ( ∼24 hours postdose ) in MADRS total score , change from baseline to 4 hours postdose and day 2 in MADRS suicide item and in Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk ( CGJ‐SR ) measured using the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool ( SIBAT ) , as well as response rate (= 50 % improvement on MADRS ) and remission rate ( MADRS total score = 12 ) at day 2 . Safety included assessment of treatment‐emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) , vital signs and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) total score . Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance models ; as a proofof‐concept study , a two‐sided 0.20 significance level was prespecified to indicate evidence of potential therapeutic effect . Results : Of the 68 patients randomized , 49 ( ESK : 27 ; placebo : 22 ) completed the DB treatment phase . Mean ( SD ) baseline MADRS total scores were : 38.5 ( 6.17 ) and 38.8 ( 7.02 ) for the ESK and placebo groups , respectively . The primary endpoint , change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 1 ( 4 hours postdose ) was significantly greater for ESK treatment compared with placebo ( Least‐square [ LS ] mean difference:‐5.3 [ SE : 2.10 ] ; 2‐sided p = 0.015 ) . Secondary endpoint findings showed significantly greater change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 2 for ESK treatment vs placebo ( LS mean difference:‐7.2 [ SE : 2.85 ] ; 2‐sided p = 0.015 ) . Patients in the ESK group showed significantly greater improvement vs placebo in the MADRS suicide item at day 1 ( 4 hours postdose ; 2‐sided p = 0.002 ) . The ESK treatment showed evidence of potential therapeutic effect vs placebo for the MADRS suicide item at day 2 ( 2‐sided p = 0.129 ) and CGJ‐SR change from baseline at 4 hours ( 2‐sided p = 0.112 ) and day 2 ( 2‐sided p = 0.150 ) . A greater proportion of patients in ESK group achieved resolution of suicide risk ( CGJ‐SR score of 0 or 1 ) vs placebo at 4 hours ( 21.2 % [ 7/33 ] vs 9.7 % [ 3/31 ] ) and day 2 ( 40 % [ 14/35 ] vs 6.5 % [ 2/31 ] ) . The response rate at day 2 was higher in ESK group ( 54.3 % ; 9/35 ) vs placebo group ( 29 % ; 9/31 ) . Similarly , the remission rate at day 2 was higher for patients treated with ESK ( 34.3 % ; 12/35 ) vs placebo ( 16.1 % ; 5/31 ) . During the DB phase , the most common (= 20 % ) TEAEs reported in the ESK group were nausea ( 37.1 % ) , dizziness ( 34.3 % ) , dysgeusia , headache and dissociation ( 31.4 % each ) and vomiting ( 20 % ) ; 4 patients experienced serious TEAEs during the DB phase ( suicide ideation : 2 , agitation : 1 , depressive symptoms : 1 ) . No death occurred in either group . In the ESK group , the dissociative / perceptual changes measured by CADSS had an onset shortly after the start of intranasal dosing and generally resolved by 2 hours post dose . Conclusions : In patients with MDD who were assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide , intranasal ESK 84 mg demonstrated statistically significant and clinically meaningful effects in reducing depressive symptoms compared with placebo at 4 hours ( day 1 ) and ∼24 hours ( day 2 ) after initial dose . A significant improvement in suicidality ( as measured by MADRS suicide item and the CGJ‐SR from SIBAT ) was also observed at these time points . Moreover , intranasal ESK treatment exhibited rapid onset of response and greater likelihood of remission in this vulnerable population .

84 mg	1238	ESK 84 mg+SoC ( ESK 84 mg ) vs placebo+SoC ( placebo	"Efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of symptoms of major depressive disorder , including suicidal ideation , in patients assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide : a proof - ofconcept study.^ 
 Background : Patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) have an increased risk of suicide that is 20 times greater than that of general population . The standard of care ( SoC ) for patients with MDD who are at imminent risk for suicide includes hospitalization and treatment with conventional antidepressants for underlying depression . However , hospitalizations are temporary and do not eliminate the risk of suicide , and conventional antidepressant pharmacotherapies show a delayed onset of action that limits their utility in treating vulnerable patients . Recent clinical studies of the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine and one of its active isomers , esketamine ( ESK ) , have suggested rapid onset of antidepressant action . In addition , preliminary studies of intravenous ketamine demonstrated rapid reduction of suicidal ideation ( SI ) in patients with MDD . Intranasal ESK is currently in development for the rapid reduction in symptoms of MDD , including SI , in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Methods : The PeRSEVERe trial was a randomized , doubleblind ( DB ) , placebo‐controlled , multicenter , phase 2 , proofof‐concept study . Eligible patients ( aged 18 to 64 years ) who met the inclusion criteria of having a DSM‐IV diagnosis of MDD as well as active SI and intent as confirmed by the Mini International Psychiatric Interview ( MINI ) and of being in need of acute psychiatric hospitalization , were enrolled . The study consisted of a screening phase ( 24 to 48 hours ) , a DB treatment phase ( day 1 to 25 ) , wherein patients were randomized ( 1:1 ) to intranasal ESK ( 84 mg ) or intranasal placebo , administered 2 times / week , and a post‐treatment follow‐up phase ( day 26 to 81 ) . All patients received SoC treatment , including hospitalization and oral antidepressants . The primary endpoint for ESK 84 mg+SoC ( ESK 84 mg ) vs placebo+SoC ( placebo ) was change from baseline ( day 1 , predose ) to 4 hours postdose on day 1 in MADRS total score . Secondary and exploratory endpoints included change from baseline to day 2 ( ∼24 hours postdose ) in MADRS total score , change from baseline to 4 hours postdose and day 2 in MADRS suicide item and in Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk ( CGJ‐SR ) measured using the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool ( SIBAT ) , as well as response rate (= 50 % improvement on MADRS ) and remission rate ( MADRS total score = 12 ) at day 2 . Safety included assessment of treatment‐emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) , vital signs and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) total score . Statistical analyses were performed using analysis of covariance models ; as a proofof‐concept study , a two‐sided 0.20 significance level was prespecified to indicate evidence of potential therapeutic effect . Results : Of the 68 patients randomized , 49 ( ESK : 27 ; placebo : 22 ) completed the DB treatment phase . Mean ( SD ) baseline MADRS total scores were : 38.5 ( 6.17 ) and 38.8 ( 7.02 ) for the ESK and placebo groups , respectively . The primary endpoint , change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 1 ( 4 hours postdose ) was significantly greater for ESK treatment compared with placebo ( Least‐square [ LS ] mean difference:‐5.3 [ SE : 2.10 ] ; 2‐sided p = 0.015 ) . Secondary endpoint findings showed significantly greater change from baseline in MADRS total score at day 2 for ESK treatment vs placebo ( LS mean difference:‐7.2 [ SE : 2.85 ] ; 2‐sided p = 0.015 ) . Patients in the ESK group showed significantly greater improvement vs placebo in the MADRS suicide item at day 1 ( 4 hours postdose ; 2‐sided p = 0.002 ) . The ESK treatment showed evidence of potential therapeutic effect vs placebo for the MADRS suicide item at day 2 ( 2‐sided p = 0.129 ) and CGJ‐SR change from baseline at 4 hours ( 2‐sided p = 0.112 ) and day 2 ( 2‐sided p = 0.150 ) . A greater proportion of patients in ESK group achieved resolution of suicide risk ( CGJ‐SR score of 0 or 1 ) vs placebo at 4 hours ( 21.2 % [ 7/33 ] vs 9.7 % [ 3/31 ] ) and day 2 ( 40 % [ 14/35 ] vs 6.5 % [ 2/31 ] ) . The response rate at day 2 was higher in ESK group ( 54.3 % ; 9/35 ) vs placebo group ( 29 % ; 9/31 ) . Similarly , the remission rate at day 2 was higher for patients treated with ESK ( 34.3 % ; 12/35 ) vs placebo ( 16.1 % ; 5/31 ) .

40 - 75 - mg	5628	the drug at home ( 40 - 75 - mg inhaled ) . In -	"An encounter with the self : A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^ 
 INTRODUCTION : N , N - Dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates , especially given the "" disconnected consciousness "" suggested by the "" breakthrough "" DMT state . Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience 's qualitative content , over and above the phenomenological structure . This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self , which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative . METHODS : This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis . Screened , healthy , anonymized , and experienced DMT users were observed during their non - clinical use of the drug at home ( 40 - 75 - mg inhaled ) . In - depth semi - structured interviews , inspired by the micro - phenomenological technique , were employed immediately after their experience . This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited , the "" self "" ; where analyses of the "" other "" were previously reported . A total of 36 post - DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian ( 83 % ) men ( eight women ) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded . RESULTS : Invariably , profound and highly intense experiences occurred . The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects , encompassing super - ordinate themes including sensory , emotion and body , and space - time shifts ; the second category comprised bodily effects , encompassing themes including pleasurable , neutral / both , and uncomfortable ; the third category comprised the sensorial effects , encompassing open - eye , visual , and cross - modal and other ; the fourth comprised the psychological effects , encompassing memory and language , awareness and sense of self , and time distortions ; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects , encompassing positive , neither / both , and challenging experiences . Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience . DISCUSSION : The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one 's personal and self - referential experiences of the body , senses , psychology , and emotions . The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences , such as the alien abduction , shamanic and near - death experiences , are also elaborated upon . Putative neural mechanisms and their promise as a psychotherapeutic agent , especially owing to deep emotional impact , are discussed ."

 BACKGROUND : Oral premedication with midazolam and ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce emotional trauma and ensure smooth induction . However , various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile . The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low - dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine . METHODS : We performed a prospective randomized double - blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups . Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1 ) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1 ) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1 ) oral ketamine . The preoperative sedation score , ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4 - point scale . The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted . RESULTS : Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups ( group M 95.9 % ; group MK 97.96 % ) , without any serious side effects . However , the combination offered significantly more children in an awake , calm and quiet state , who were easily separated from their parents ( 73.46 % in MK vs 41 % in group M ) . The induction scores were comparable between the groups . The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups . CONCLUSIONS : Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics . However , the combination provided more children in an awake , calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents ."

 LSD is a so‐called "" classic "" or serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic . The effects of LSD have been frequently investigated in the past in both healthy participants and patients . In these studies , LSD produced acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including visual perceptual alterations , audio‐visual synesthesia , derealization and depersonalization . Moreover , several of these studies described robust and sustained effects of LSD in patients suffering from addiction , anxiety and depression . Its psychedelic effects are mainly attributed to its potent partial 5‐HT2A receptor agonism . Consistently , administration the 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin ( 40 mg ) prior to the administration of LSD ( 100 μg ) almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD in another study of our research group ( NCT03321136 ) . The present study hypothesis is that ketanserin ( 40 mg ) administered 1h after LSD shortens and reduces the acute subjective effects of LSD ( 100 μg ) compared to LSD alone ( 100 μg ) followed by placebo in healthy humans . Such a finding would confirm a primarily competitive antagonism of ketanserin and LSD at the 5‐HT2A receptor in vivo and indicate that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when present at the receptor ."

50 µg	6247	and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD . Between each	"The Effect of LSD on Neural Synchrony , Prosocial Behavior , and Relationship Quality.^ 
 Evidence is growing that psychedelic substances such as psilocybin , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) and ayahuasca could be a potential alternative treatment option for common and difficult to treat psychiatric conditions . One proposed mechanism that psychedelics target , which is a hallmark of seemingly all psychiatric disorders , are deficits in social cognitive abilities . However , the neural underpinnings of psychedelic induced alterations in prosocial behavior are currently unknown . The investigators hypothesize psychedelics increase such prosocial behaviors by increasing neural synchrony , which is the coupling of brain‐to‐brain activity across two or more people ; it has been found to underlie social connection and various forms of shared prosocial behavior . The current project will primarily assess whether LSD enhances neural synchrony between romantic partners . Second , the investigators will assess whether LSD enhances prosocial behavior between members of a dyad , thus replicating previous studies which assessed prosocial behavior within one individual at a time . The investigators will also assess the relationship between neural synchrony and outcome variables of the prosocial behaviour tasks . Lastly , it will be assessed whether LSD‐induced changes in neural synchrony and/or prosocial behaviour affect persisting relationship quality . Oxytocin and cytokine concentrations , will also be quantified to investigate whether there is a relationship between these factors and changes in prosocial behaviour . The study design will be conducted according to a double‐blind , placebo‐controlled , 2‐way crossover design . Healthy participants ( N=60 ) who are in a relationship ( N=30 couples ) will receive placebo and an oral dose of 50 µg of LSD . Between each condition , there will be a minimum of 14 days washout . This leads to a total study duration of minimally four weeks , for a participant to go through the medical examination and both drug conditions ."
25 mg	1264	receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart	"Trial of Psilocybin versus Escitalopram for Depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Psilocybin may have antidepressant properties , but direct comparisons between psilocybin and established treatments for depression are lacking . METHODS : In a phase 2 , double - blind , randomized , controlled trial involving patients with long - standing , moderate - to - severe major depressive disorder , we compared psilocybin with escitalopram , a selective serotonin - reuptake inhibitor , over a 6 - week period . Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo ( psilocybin group ) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram ( escitalopram group ) ; all the patients received psychological support . The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16 - item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self - Report ( QIDS - SR-16 ; scores range from 0 to 27 , with higher scores indicating greater depression ) at week 6 . There were 16 secondary outcomes , including QIDS - SR-16 response ( defined as a reduction in score of > 50 % ) and QIDS - SR-16 remission ( defined as a score of ≤5 ) at week 6 . RESULTS : A total of 59 patients were enrolled ; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group . The mean scores on the QIDS - SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group . The mean ( ±SE ) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0±1.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0±1.0 in the escitalopram group , for a between - group difference of 2.0 points ( 95 % confidence interval [ CI ] , -5.0 to 0.9 ) ( P = 0.17 ) . A QIDS - SR-16 response occurred in 70 % of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48 % of those in the escitalopram group , for a between - group difference of 22 percentage points ( 95 % CI , -3 to 48 ) ; QIDS - SR-16 remission occurred in 57 % and 28 % , respectively , for a between - group difference of 28 percentage points ( 95 % CI , 2 to 54 ) . Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram , but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons . The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups . CONCLUSIONS : On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS - SR-16 at week 6 , this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients . Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram , but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons . Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants .

0.5 mg / kg	8481	effects between intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) and	"Ketamine for Social Anxiety Disorder : A Randomized , Placebo - Controlled Crossover Trial.^ 
 Many patients with social anxiety disorder ( SAD ) experience inadequate symptom relief from available treatments . Ketamine is a potent N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders . Therefore , we conducted a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with DSM-5 SAD and compared the effects between intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) and placebo ( normal saline ) on social phobia symptoms . Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28 - day washout period between infusions . Ratings of anxiety were assessed 3 - h post - infusion and followed for 14 days . We used linear mixed models to assess the impact of ketamine and placebo on anxiety symptoms . Outcomes were blinded ratings on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale ( LSAS ) and self - reported anxiety on a visual analog scale ( VAS - Anxiety ) . We also used the Wilcoxon signed - rank test to compare the proportion of treatment responders . Based on prior studies , we defined response as a greater than 35 % LSAS reduction and 50 % VAS - Anxiety reduction . We found ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety relative to placebo on the LSAS ( Time × Treatment : F(9,115)=2.6 , p=0.01 ) but not the VAS - Anxiety ( Time × Treatment : F(10,141)=0.4 , p=0.95 ) . Participants were significantly more likely to exhibit a treatment response after ketamine infusion relative to placebo in the first 2 weeks following infusion measured on the LSAS ( 33.33 % response ketamine vs 0 % response placebo , Wilcoxon signed - rank test z=2.24 , p=0.025 ) and VAS ( 88.89 % response ketamine vs 52.94 % response placebo , Wilcoxon signed - rank test z=2.12 , p=0.034 ) . In conclusion , this proof - of - concept trial provides initial evidence that ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety ."

 Meditation and psychedelics have played key roles in humankind 's search for self - transcendence and personal change . However , neither their possible synergistic effects , nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied . To elucidate these issues , we administered double - blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin ( 315 μg / kg PO ) or placebo to meditators ( n = 39 ) during a 5 - day mindfulness group retreat . Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self - dissolution along the perception - hallucination continuum , without concomitant anxiety . Openness , optimism , and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response . Compared with placebo , psilocybin enhanced post - intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4 - month follow - up , which were corroborated by external ratings , and associated with magnitude of acute self - dissolution experience . Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin 's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses . These findings highlight the interactions between non - pharmacological and pharmacological factors , and the role of emotion / attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states , as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes . A better comprehension of mechanisms underlying most beneficial psychedelic experiences may guide therapeutic interventions across numerous mental conditions in the form of psychedelic - assisted applications ."

 PURPOSE : Postpartum depression is a common complication of childbirth . In the last decade , it has been suggested that subdissociative - dose ketamine is a fast - acting antidepressant . We aimed to investigate the efficacy of low - dose ketamine administered during caesarean section in preventing postpartum depression . METHODS : Using a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled design , 330 parturients who were scheduled to undergo caesarean section were enrolled in this trial . The parturients were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg diluted to 10 mL with 0.9 % saline ) or placebo ( 10 mL of 0.9 % saline ) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord . The primary outcome was the degree of depression , which was evaluated using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) ( a threshold of 9/10 was used ) at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery . The secondary outcome was the numeric rating scale score of pain at 3 day and 6 week postpartum . RESULTS : No significant differences were found in the prevalence of postpartum depression between the two groups at 3 days and 6 weeks after delivery . The pain scores measured at 3 days postoperatively were not significantly different between the groups , whereas the scores measured at 6 week postpartum were significantly reduced in the treatment group compared with the saline group ( P = 0.014 ) .

50 mg	4729	with intranasal ketamine hydrochloride ( 50 mg ) or saline solution .	"A randomized controlled trial of intranasal ketamine in major depressive disorder.^ 
 BACKGROUND : The N - methyl - D - aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine , delivered via an intravenous route , has shown rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment - resistant depression . The current study was designed to test the safety , tolerability , and efficacy of intranasal ketamine in patients with depression who had failed at least one prior antidepressant trial . METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , crossover study , 20 patients with major depression were randomly assigned , and 18 completed 2 treatment days with intranasal ketamine hydrochloride ( 50 mg ) or saline solution . The primary efficacy outcome measure was change in depression severity 24 hours after ketamine or placebo , measured using the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale . Secondary outcomes included persistence of benefit , changes in self - reports of depression , changes in anxiety , and proportion of responders . Potential psychotomimetic , dissociative , hemodynamic , and general adverse effects associated with ketamine were also measured . RESULTS : Patients showed significant improvement in depressive symptoms at 24 hours after ketamine compared to placebo ( t = 4.39 , p < .001 ; estimated mean Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score difference of 7.6 ± 3.7 ; 95 % confidence interval , 3.9 - 11.3 ) . Response criteria were met by 8 of 18 patients ( 44 % ) 24 hours after ketamine administration compared with 1 of 18 ( 6 % ) after placebo ( p = .033 ) . Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with minimal psychotomimetic or dissociative effects and was not associated with clinically significant changes in hemodynamic parameters . CONCLUSIONS : This study provides the first controlled evidence for the rapid antidepressant effects of intranasal ketamine . Treatment was associated with minimal adverse effects . If replicated , these findings may lead to novel approaches to the pharmacologic treatment of patients with major depression ."
100 μg	2099	the administration of LSD ( 100 μg ) and placebo in a	"A Single Dose of LSD Does Not Alter Gene Expression of the Serotonin 2A Receptor Gene ( HTR2A ) or Early Growth Response Genes ( EGR1 - 3 ) in Healthy Subjects.^ 
 Rationale : Renewed interest has been seen in the use of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) in psychiatric research and practice . The repeated use of LSD leads to tolerance that is believed to result from serotonin ( 5 - HT ) 5 - HT(2A ) receptor downregulation . In rats , daily LSD administration for 4 days decreased frontal cortex 5 - HT(2A ) receptor binding . Additionally , a single dose of LSD acutely increased expression of the early growth response genes EGR1 and EGR2 in rat and mouse brains through 5 - HT(2A ) receptor stimulation . No human data on the effects of LSD on gene expression has been reported . Therefore , we investigated the effects of single - dose LSD administration on the expression of the 5 - HT(2A ) receptor gene ( HTR2A ) and EGR1 - 3 genes . Methods : mRNA expression levels were analyzed in whole blood as a peripheral biomarker in 15 healthy subjects before and 1.5 and 24 h after the administration of LSD ( 100 μg ) and placebo in a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , cross - over study . Results : LSD did not alter the expression of the HTR2A or EGR1 - 3 genes 1.5 and 24 h after administration compared with placebo . Conclusion : No changes were observed in the gene expression of LSD 's primary target receptor gene or genes that are implicated in its downstream effects . Remaining unclear is whether chronic LSD administration alters gene expression in humans ."

 The use of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) has frequently been associated with increased levels of impulsivity during abstinence . The effects of MDMA on measures of impulsivity , however , have not yet been studied during intoxication . The present study was designed to assess the acute effects of MDMA and alcohol , alone and in combination , on behavioral measures of impulsivity and risk - taking behavior . A total of 18 recreational users of MDMA entered a double - blind placebo - controlled six - way crossover study . The treatments consisted of MDMA 0 , 75 , and 100 mg with and without alcohol . Alcohol dosing was designed to achieve a peak blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) of about 0.06 g / dl during laboratory testing . Laboratory tests of impulsivity were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h post - MDMA and included a stop - signal task , a go / no - go task , and the Iowa gambling task . MDMA decreased stop reaction time in the stop - signal task indicating increased impulse control . Alcohol increased the proportion of commission errors in the stop - signal task and the go / no - go task . Signal detection analyses of alcohol - induced commission errors indicated that this effect may reflect impairment of perceptual or attentive processing rather than an increase of motor impulsivity per se . Performance in the Iowa gambling task was not affected by MDMA and alcohol , but there was a nonsignificant tendency towards improvement following alcohol intake . None of the behavioral measures of impulsivity showed a MDMA x alcohol interaction effect . The lack of interaction indicated that the CNS stimulant effects of MDMA were never sufficient to overcome alcohol - induced impairment of impulse control or risk - taking behavior ."
0.5 mg / kg	3592	RCTs examined racemic ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) given intravenously and found	"The rapid anti - suicidal ideation effect of ketamine : A systematic review.^ 
 In many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years - presenting a public health crisis . Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness , usually a depressive disorder . Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA - approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks - thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients . We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [ SI ] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome . A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [ preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta - analyses ] criteria . PubMed search inclusive of "" ketamine "" and "" suicide "" yielded 358 results . Papers ( N = 354 ) were then read by at least two authors , identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI . Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients . Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline . One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post - dose . Further research is warranted into : optimal dosing strategy , including number and frequency ; and long - term efficacy and safety . Ultimately , it remains to be shown that ketamine 's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior ."

 Background and objective : Acute treatment options for Cluster headache patients who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited . Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a Cluster headache attack but never systematically tested . Methods : We conducted an open‐label pilot study in which 20 chronic Cluster headache patients according to International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd were treated during one cluster headache attack with intranasal ketamine . Under in‐hospital observation patients received 15 mg ketamine by intranasal spray every six minutes a maximum of five times . The primary endpoint was a 50 % reduction of pain intensity within 15 minutes after initiating treatment . Results : The primary endpoint was not met . However , 30 minutes after first application the pain intensity was reduced by 59 % from 7.25 ± 1.24 to 2.94 ± 3.40 on a 1 1 points numeric rating scale ( mean , SD , p = 0.0002 ) and 11 out of 16 ( 69 % ) scored four or below on the numeric rating scale . Exactly , half the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection and complete relief was self‐reported by 8 out of 20 patients ( 40 % ) . No serious advense events were identified during the trial . Conclusion : Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment of cluster headache within 30 minutes but should be tested in a larger controlled design . Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine ."

 Tolerance of the behavioral effects of the short - acting , endogenous hallucinogen , N , N - dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) is seen inconsistently in animals , and has not been produced in humans . The nature and time course of responses to repetitive , closely spaced administrations of an hallucinogenic dose of DMT were characterized . Thirteen experienced hallucinogen users received intravenous 0.3 mg / kg DMT fumarate , or saline placebo , four times , at 30 min intervals , on 2 separate days , in a randomized , double - blind , design . Tolerance to "" psychedelic "" subjective effects did not occur according to either clinical interview or Hallucinogen Rating Scale scores . Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) , prolactin , cortisol , and heart rate responses decreased with repeated DMT administration , although blood pressure did not . These data demonstrate the unique properties of DMT relative to other hallucinogens and underscore the differential regulation of the multiple processes mediating the effects of DMT ."

 MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , "" Ecstasy "" ) mainly releases serotonin and dopamine . In animals , pretreatment with 5 - HT(2 ) antagonists has been shown to attenuate neurochemical and behavioral effects of MDMA . In humans , the role of 5 - HT(2 ) receptors in the action of MDMA has not been studied . We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the 5 - HT(2A / C ) antagonist ketanserin ( 50 mg p.o . ) on subjective responses to MDMA ( 1.5 mg / kg p.o . ) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double - blind placebo - controlled within - subject design . Subjective effects were rated by psychometric rating scales . Physiological effects measured were blood pressure , heart rate , and body temperature . Adverse effects were assessed during the sessions , and after one and three days . Ketanserin attenuated MDMA - induced perceptual changes , emotional excitation , and acute adverse responses but had little effect on MDMA - induced positive mood , well - being , extroversion , and short - term sequelae . Body temperature was lower under MDMA plus ketanserin compared to MDMA alone . The results suggest a contributing role for 5 - HT(2 ) receptors in the action of MDMA in humans ."

Ketamine produced positive symptoms , negative symptoms , emotional discomfort , and cognitive effects as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale ( PANSS ) in a dose - related fashion . The lower ketamine dose produced subjective effects similar to two standard ethanol drinks , whereas the higher ketamine dose produced effects similar to five standard drinks . Although naltrexone produced no significant behavioral effects , it significantly magnified the increase in the total PANSS score produced by the lower subperceptual dose of ketamine , but not the higher perception - altering dose of ketamine . These data suggest that the interplay of opiate receptor antagonism and NMDA receptor antagonism may be relevant to the protective effects of naltrexone on alcohol consumption via potentiation of dysphoric effects associated with the NMDA receptor antagonist effects of ethanol .

.16 mg / kg	4508	of the hallucinogen psilocybin ( .16 mg / kg ) versus placebo on amygdala	"Psilocybin - Induced Decrease in Amygdala Reactivity Correlates with Enhanced Positive Mood in Healthy Volunteers.^ 
 BACKGROUND : The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion - processing circuits . In healthy volunteers , acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states . However , it is little - known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change . METHODS : This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin ( .16 mg / kg ) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level - dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging . Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State - Trait Anxiety Inventory . A double - blind , randomized , cross - over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart . RESULTS : Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration . The psilocybin - induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin - induced increase in positive mood state . CONCLUSIONS : These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers . These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression ."
0.5mg / kg	5082	to receive either ketamine ( 0.5mg / kg ) or placebo ( saline	"Neuropsychological and mood effects of ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy : a randomised controlled trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) may be neuroprotective against cognitive impairment and have synergistic antidepressant effects . This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT , in a randomised , placebo - controlled , double - blind study . METHODS : Fifty - one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse - width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine ( 0.5mg / kg ) or placebo ( saline ) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT . Neuropsychological outcomes ( measured before ECT , after six treatments , and after the final ECT treatment ) and mood outcomes ( measured before ECT , and weekly after every three ECT treatments ) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition . RESULTS : Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups . The ECT - ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one - week follow up , though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course . No psychomimetic effects were detected . LIMITATIONS : The study was conducted in a clinical setting , so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled . Thiopentone doses differed slightly between groups , in order to accommodate the addition of ketamine to the anaesthetic . CONCLUSIONS : The addition of ketamine did not decrease cognitive impairment in patients having ultrabrief pulse - width right unilateral ECT , but was safe and slightly improved efficacy in the first week of treatment and at one - week follow up .

 The success of modern medicine creates a growing population of those suffering from life - threatening illnesses ( LTI ) who often experience anxiety , depression , and existential distress . We present a novel approach ; investigating MDMA - assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of anxiety in people with an LTI . Participants with anxiety from an LTI were randomized in a double - blind study to receive MDMA ( 125 mg , n = 13 ) or placebo ( n = 5 ) in combination with two 8 - h psychotherapy sessions . The primary outcome was change in State - Trait Anxiety Inventory ( STAI ) Trait scores from baseline to one month post the second experimental session . After unblinding , participants in the MDMA group had one open - label MDMA session and placebo participants crossed over to receive three open - label MDMA sessions . Additional follow - up assessments occurred six and twelve months after a participant 's last experimental session . At the primary endpoint , the MDMA group had a greater mean ( SD ) reduction in STAI - Trait scores , - 23.5 ( 13.2 ) , indicating less anxiety , compared to placebo group , - 8.8 ( 14.7 ) ; results did not reach a significant group difference ( p = .056 ) . Hedges ' g between - group effect size was 1.03 ( 95 % CI : - 5.25 , 7.31 ) . Overall , MDMA was well - tolerated in this sample . These preliminary findings can inform development of larger clinical trials to further examine MDMA - assisted psychotherapy as a novel approach to treat individuals with LTI - related anxiety .

 BACKGROUND : For a century , psychedelics have been investigated as models of psychosis for demonstrating phenomenological similarities with psychotic experiences and as therapeutic models for treating depression , anxiety , and substance use disorders . This study sought to explore this paradoxical relationship connecting key parameters of the psychotic experience , psychotherapy , and psychedelic experience . METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover design , 24 healthy volunteers received 50 μg d - lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) or inactive placebo . Psychotic experience was assessed by aberrant salience ( Aberrant Salience Inventory , ASI ) , therapeutic potential by suggestibility ( Creative Imagination Scale , CIS ) and mindfulness ( Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire , FFMQ ; Mindful Attention Awareness Scale , MAAS ; Experiences Questionnaire , EQ ) , and psychedelic experience by four questionnaires ( Altered State of Consciousness Questionnaire , ASC ; Mystical Experiences Questionnaire , MEQ ; Challenging Experiences Questionnaire , CEQ ; Ego - Dissolution Inventory , EDI ) . Relationships between LSD - induced effects were examined . RESULTS : LSD induced psychedelic experiences , including alteration of consciousness , mystical experiences , ego - dissolution , and mildly challenging experiences , increased aberrant salience and suggestibility , but not mindfulness . LSD - induced aberrant salience correlated highly with complex imagery , mystical experiences , and ego - dissolution . LSD - induced suggestibility correlated with no other effects . Individual mindfulness changes correlated with aspects of aberrant salience and psychedelic experience . CONCLUSIONS : The LSD state resembles a psychotic experience and offers a tool for healing . The link between psychosis model and therapeutic model seems to lie in mystical experiences . The results point to the importance of meaning attribution for the LSD psychosis model and indicate that psychedelic - assisted therapy might benefit from therapeutic suggestions fostering mystical experiences ."

 BACKGROUND : The antidepressant effect of low - dose ketamine infusion on Taiwanese patients with anxious vs nonanxious treatment - resistant depression ( ANX - TRD vs NANX - TRD ) has remained unknown . METHODS : In total , 71 patients with TRD were randomized to three groups . Each group had participants who received saline infusions mixed with 0 ( a normal saline infusion ) , 0.2 , and 0.5 mg / kg of ketamine . Participants were followed up for 2 weeks . Anxious depression was defined as major depressive disorder with a total score of 7 or more on the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale Anxiety - Somatization factor . Generalized estimating equation models were used to investigate the effects of treatment ( ketamine vs placebo ) and depression type ( ANX - TRD vs NANX - TRD ) in the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow - up period . RESULTS : Patients with ANX - TRD were less likely to respond to a single low - dose ketamine infusion than those with NANX - TRD . Among patients with NANX - TRD , low - dose ketamine infusion was significantly superior to placebo for reducing depressive symptoms . However , among patients with ANX - TRD , ketamine was not superior to placebo ; nonetheless , approximately 30 % of the patients responded to ketamine infusion compared to 13 % who responded to the placebo . CONCLUSIONS : Low - dose ketamine infusion was effective for Taiwanese patients with NANX - TRD but not so effective for those with ANX - TRD . A higher level of anxiety severity accompanying depression was related to greater depression severity . This may confound and reduce the antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion ."

 The Investigational New Drug SM‐001 is formulated as a hot water decoction of two proprietary clonal cultivars of the Peruvian plants , Banisteriopsis caapi ( BC ) and Psychotria viridis ( PV ) . It represents a modern formulation of an ancient Amazonian botanical medicine , "" ayahuasca "" ( "" vine of the soul "" ) that is used by many native South American indigenous and mestizo groups for both religious and medicinal purposes . This initial Phase 1 study is to be conducted as an open label , dose‐ranging safety assessment of a single dose of SM‐001 taken orally by healthy adult volunteers . Twelve adult men and women , ages 25‐65 years , will be consecutively assigned to one of three dose levels , 4 subjects per group ( 2 M ; 2 F ) . In the presence of the Clinical Investigator(s ) , each subject will receive a single dose of SM‐001 , administered at the Clinical Study Site as a liquid at one of three dose levels : 1 , 2 , or 3 ml SM‐001 per kg body weight . To assess systemic exposure to SM‐001 , plasma levels of the four biomarkers , dimethyltryptamine , harmine , tetrahydroharmine , and harmaline will be measured . Blood samples will be drawn at baseline , HR 0 ( pre‐Study Drug dose ) , and then at HR 1 , 2 , 4 , 8 , and 24 post dose . Subjects will return to the Clinical Study Site at Study Day 28 for a final in‐person assessment ."

 BACKGROUND : Clinical evidence that ketamine , a nonselective N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) antagonist , has therapeutic effects within hours in people suffering from depression suggests that modulating glutamatergic neurotransmission is a fundamental step in alleviating the debilitating symptoms of mood disorders . Acutely , ketamine increases extracellular glutamate levels , neuronal excitability , and spontaneous γ oscillations , but it is unknown whether these effects are key to the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine . METHODS : Twenty drug - free major depressive disorder patients received a single , open - label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( .5 mg / kg ) . Magnetoencephalographic recordings were made approximately 3 days before and approximately 6.5 hours after the infusion , whereas patients passively received tactile stimulation to the right and left index fingers and also while they rested ( eyes - closed ) . Antidepressant response was assessed by percentage change in Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores . RESULTS : Patients with robust improvements in depressive symptoms 230 min after infusion ( responders ) exhibited increased cortical excitability within this antidepressant response window . Specifically , we found that stimulus - evoked somatosensory cortical responses increase after infusion , relative to pretreatment responses in responders but not in treatment nonresponders . Spontaneous somatosensory cortical γ - band activity during rest did not change within the same timeframe after ketamine in either responders or nonresponders . CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest NMDAR antagonism does not lead directly to increased cortical excitability hours later and thus might not be sufficient for therapeutic effects of ketamine to take hold . Rather , increased cortical excitability as depressive symptoms improve is consistent with the hypothesis that enhanced non - NMDAR - mediated glutamatergic neurotransmission via synaptic potentiation is central to the antidepressant effect of ketamine ."

 The psychoactive drug ±3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is increasingly used for its perceived emotional effects ( eg , prosociality , empathy , psychotherapy ) , but surprisingly little research has been aimed at identifying the effect of the drug on emotional episodic memory in humans . Here , we report the first double - blind placebo - controlled study to examine the effects of MDMA on emotional memory separately during encoding and retrieval in healthy participants . Participants viewed emotionally negative , neutral , and positive pictures and their labels . Forty - eight hours later , they were given cued recollection and recognition memory tests designed to assess recollection and familiarity for the studied pictures . Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups who received MDMA ( 1 mg / kg ) either during encoding ( Encoding group ; N=20 ) , retrieval ( Retrieval group ; N=20 ) , or neither ( Placebo group ; N=20 ) . Although MDMA administered at either phase did not affect overall memory accuracy , it did alter the recollection of details associated specifically with emotional memories as estimated using a dual process signal detection analysis of confidence judgments and subjective ' remember ' judgments . In the Encoding group , MDMA reduced recollection estimates for negative and positive pictures but had little to no effect on neutral items or familiarity estimates . There was evidence for similar trends in the Retrieval group . These findings indicate that MDMA attenuates the encoding and retrieval of salient details from emotional events , consistent with the idea that its potential therapeutic effects for treating posttraumatic stress disorder are related to altering emotional memory ."
0.3 mg / kg	5249	single - dose psilocybin ( 0.3 mg / kg ) or niacin in conjunction	"Individual Experiences in Four Cancer Patients Following Psilocybin - Assisted Psychotherapy.^ 
 A growing body of evidence shows that existential and spiritual well - being in cancer patients is associated with better medical outcomes , improved quality of life , and serves as a buffer against depression , hopelessness , and desire for hastened death . Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin - assisted psychotherapy in treating cancer - related anxiety and depression . A double - blind controlled trial was performed , where 29 patients with cancer - related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned to treatment with single - dose psilocybin ( 0.3 mg / kg ) or niacin in conjunction with psychotherapy . Previously published results of this trial demonstrated that , in conjunction with psychotherapy , moderate - dose psilocybin produced rapid , robust , and enduring anxiolytic , and anti - depressant effects . Here , we illustrate unique clinical courses described by four participants using quantitative measures of acute and persisting effects of psilocybin , anxiety , depression , quality of life , and spiritual well - being , as well as qualitative interviews , written narratives , and clinician notes . Although the content of each psilocybin - assisted experience was unique to each participant , several thematic similarities and differences across the various sessions stood out . These four participants ' personal narratives extended beyond the cancer diagnosis itself , frequently revolving around themes of self - compassion and love , acceptance of death , and memories of past trauma , though the specific details or narrative content differ substantially . The results presented here demonstrate the personalized nature of the subjective experiences elicited through treatment with psilocybin , particularly with respect to the spiritual and/or psychological needs of each patient ."
0.5 mg / kg	2035	or six ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) in	"Ketamine infusions for treatment resistant depression : a series of 28 patients treated weekly or twice weekly in an ECT clinic.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine has a rapid antidepressant effect in treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . The effects on cognitive function of multiple ketamine infusions and of concurrent antidepressant medication on response rate and duration are not known . METHOD : Twenty - eight patients with uni- or bipolar TRD were treated over three weeks with either three or six ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) in the recovery room of a routine ECT clinic . Post - treatment memory assessments were conducted on day 21 ( 4 - 7 days after the final infusion ) . Patients were followed up for six months where possible , with severity of depression and side effects monitored throughout . RESULTS : Eight ( 29 % ) patients responded of whom four remitted . Only three ( 11 % ) patients had responded within six hours after a single infusion , but in all responders , the response had developed before the third infusion . The duration of response from the final infusion was variable ( median 70 , range 25 - 168 days ) . Discontinuations included two ( 7 % ) because of acute adverse reactions during the infusion and five ( 18 % ) because of failure to benefit and increasing anxiety . Ketamine was not associated with memory impairment . The ECT clinic was rated suitable by patients and offered appropriate levels of monitoring . CONCLUSION : This small , open label naturalistic study shows that up to six low dose ketamine infusions can safely be given within an existing NHS clinical structure to patients who continue their antidepressants . The response rate was comparable to that found in RCTs of single doses of ketamine in antidepressant - free patients but took slightly longer to develop ."

 BACKGROUND : Illicit MDMA use has been associated with hyponatremia , particularly in females . A previous study found that MDMA administration elevated plasma arginine vasopressin ( AVP , antidiuretic hormone ) levels in healthy volunteers . However , the study employed a lower dose than is commonly used by illicit users and only included males . We sought to measure AVP and serum sodium after a psychoactive dose of MDMA in both males and females . METHODS : Eight males and eight females , all healthy and MDMA‐experienced , received 1.5 mg / kg oral MDMA alone and in combination with the alpha‐1 adrenergic inverse agonist prazosin in a placebo‐controlled , within‐subjects randomized controlled trial . AVP and serum sodium were measured before and 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , and 6 hours after MDMA . Cmax were determined and analyzed using linear models . RESULTS : Despite having robust psychoactive effects , MDMA did not significantly affect AVP . Cmax was 5.000 ± 5.042 ( mean ± 95%CI ) after MDMA vs. 2.394 ± 5.042 after placebo ( p = 0.468 ) . Serum sodium at TMax for AVP was 139.50 ? 0.917 mmol / L for MDMA vs. 140.38 ± 0.917 mmol / L for placebo ( p = 0.182 ) . However , two male volunteers had brief large AVP elevations after MDMA ( 28.8 and 18.7 pg / mL at 1 hr post dose ) . CONCLUSION : AVP elevations in illicit MDMA users may represent an idiosyncratic response to MDMA . Additional mechanisms , including excessive water intake , may contribute to hyponatremia in illicit MDMA users . Supported by NIH DA 016776 ."
260 μg / kg	7124	. ) , psilocybin ( 260 μg / kg p.o . ) , or	"Psilocybin - induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition are attenuated by ketanserin in healthy human volunteers.^ 
 The serotonin-2A receptor ( 5 - HT(2A)R ) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related inhibitory gating and behavioral inhibition deficits of schizophrenia patients . The hallucinogen psilocybin disrupts automatic forms of sensorimotor gating and response inhibition in humans , but it is unclear so far whether the 5 - HT(2A)R or 5 - HT(1A)R agonist properties of its bioactive metabolite psilocin account for these effects . Thus , we investigated whether psilocybin - induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition in healthy humans could be attenuated by the 5 - HT(2A/2C)R antagonist ketanserin . A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo , ketanserin ( 40 mg p.o . ) , psilocybin ( 260 μg / kg p.o . ) , or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double - blind , randomized , and counterbalanced order . Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) of the acoustic startle response . The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire ( 5D - ASC ) , and the Color - Word Stroop Test . Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals ( 30 ms ) , increased all 5D - ASC scores , and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test . Stroop interference and Stroop effect of the response latencies were increased under psilocybin as well . Psilocybin - induced alterations were attenuated by ketanserin pretreatment , whereas ketanserin alone had no significant effects . These findings suggest that the disrupting effects of psilocybin on automatic and controlled inhibition processes are attributable to 5 - HT(2A)R stimulation . Sensorimotor gating and attentional control deficits of schizophrenia patients might be due to changes within the 5 - HT(2A)R system ."

 BACKGROUND : A rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine has repeatedly been documented in the literature , and identifying clinical features associated with a better response to this treatment is currently an essential question . Considering the relationship between rumination and depression and the need to identify potential predictors of response to ketamine , we analyzed the effect of a single injection of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg on rumination in treatment - resistant depressive ( TRD ) patients and explored whether baseline ruminative style and early improvements of rumination would predict a greater antidepressant effect of ketamine . METHODS : Ten TRD outpatients who participated in a 4 - week open study on the antidepressant effect of ketamine also completed the Ruminative Response Scale the day before , the day after , and a week after ketamine administration . RESULTS : We found that in our patients , a single rapid 1 - minute intravenous injection of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg was efficacious in reducing rumination , but neither severity of rumination at baseline nor early improvements of rumination after ketamine injection predicted antidepressant response . CONCLUSIONS : Our preliminary data suggest that a single injection of ketamine 0.5 mg / kg can be efficacious in reducing rumination in TRD patients but rumination does not seem to be a useful clinical predictor of response to ketamine .

 OBJECTIVE : The present study examined the efficacy , safety , and durability of repeated ketamine infusions for the treatment of comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) and treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) in a sample of veterans . METHODS : Individuals with comorbid DSM-5 - defined PTSD and DSM - IV - defined major depressive disorder ( N = 15 ) received 6 intravenous ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg ) on a Monday - Wednesday - Friday schedule over a 12 - day period from May 2015 to June 2016 . Data from outcome measures were collected before and 24 hours after each infusion and weekly for 8 weeks following the final infusion . RESULTS : Continuous measures of symptom change were significant for both disorders and were associated with large effect sizes ( mean decrease in PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 score = 33.3 points [ 95 % CI , 23.0 - 43.5 points ] , P < .0005 , sample size - adjusted Cohen d [ d ' ] = 2.17 ; mean decrease in Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale score = 26.6 points [ 95 % CI , 23.0 - 30.2 points ] , P < .0005 , d ' = 4.64 ) . The remission rate for PTSD was 80.0 % , and the response rate for TRD was 93.3 % . Participants in remission from PTSD after the infusion series ( n = 12 ) had a median time to relapse of 41 days . Similarly , participants whose depression symptoms responded to the infusion series ( n = 14 ) had a median time to relapse of 20 days . Repeated ketamine infusions were associated with transient increases in dissociative symptoms . No participant reported worsening of PTSD symptoms over the study duration . CONCLUSIONS : This study , the first open - label study of repeated ketamine infusions in a comorbid population , found rapid and sustained improvement in PTSD and depression symptoms . This report suggests that repeated ketamine treatments are safe and may represent an efficacious treatment for individuals with comorbid PTSD and TRD .

1,540 ± 920 mg	1083	a mean total dose of 1,540 ± 920 mg ibogaine HCl . Subjects used	"Treatment of opioid use disorder with ibogaine : detoxification and drug use outcomes.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ibogaine is a monoterpene indole alkaloid used in medical and nonmedical settings for the treatment of opioid use disorder . Its mechanism of action is apparently novel . There are no published prospective studies of drug use outcomes with ibogaine . OBJECTIVES : To study outcomes following opioid detoxification with ibogaine . METHODS : In this observational study , 30 subjects with DSM - IV Opioid Dependence ( 25 males , 5 females ) received a mean total dose of 1,540 ± 920 mg ibogaine HCl . Subjects used oxycodone ( n = 21 ; 70 % ) and/or heroin ( n = 18 ; 60 % ) in respective amounts of 250 ± 180 mg / day and 1.3 ± 0.94 g / day , and averaged 3.1 ± 2.6 previous episodes of treatment for opioid dependence . Detoxification and follow - up outcomes at 1 , 3 , 6 , 9 , and 12 months were evaluated utilizing the Subjective Opioid Withdrawal Scale ( SOWS ) and Addiction Severity Index Composite ( ASIC ) scores , respectively . RESULTS : SOWS scores decreased from 31.0 ± 11.6 pretreatment to 14.0 ± 9.8 at 76.5 ± 30 hours posttreatment ( t = 7.07 , df = 26 , p < 0.001 ) . At 1 - month posttreatment follow - up , 15 subjects ( 50 % ) reported no opioid use during the previous 30 days . ASIC Drug Use and Legal and Family / Social Status scores were improved relative to pretreatment baseline at all posttreatment time points ( p < .001 ) . Improvement in Drug Use scores was maximal at 1 month , and subsequently sustained from 3 to 12 months at levels that did not reach equivalence to the effect at 1 month . CONCLUSION : Ibogaine was associated with substantive effects on opioid withdrawal symptoms and drug use in subjects for whom other treatments had been unsuccessful , and may provide a useful prototype for discovery and development of innovative pharmacotherapy of addiction ."
100 mg	7050	, 2 ) placebo+LSD ( 100 mg po ) , or 3	"Lsd increases social adaptation to opinions similar to one 's own.^ 
 Background : Inferring value from the reactions of others and adapting one 's behavior to a social group norm is an essential process in every‐day decision making . However , the neuropharmacology of social influence processing is mostly unknown , although lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , acting at multiple 5‐HT2 receptors , has recently been shown to alter social perception . Methods : The role of the 5‐HT2A receptor on social influence on aesthetic judgements was investigated by assessing social feedback processing and subsequent decision making in 23 healthy participants via fMRI and behavioral ratings . Participants received 1 ) placebo+placebo , 2 ) placebo+LSD ( 100 mg po ) , or 3 ) ketanserin ‐ a selective 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist ( 40 mg po)+LSD in three different sessions . Results : Participants adapted their opinion more strongly to the group norm in the high conflict ( HC ) condition than the low conflict ( LC ) condition under placebo and ketanserin+LSD . This pattern was reversed by LSD ( all p<0.05 , Bonferroni corrected ) . Processing LC was associated with increased BOLD signal in the dorsal striatum in the LSD condition , while processing HC was associated with increased BOLD signal in the supplementary motor area in the placebo condition . No differences in BOLD signal were observed during decision making . Conclusions : LSD increases adaptation to opinions similar to one 's own , presumably via stimulation of 5‐HT2A receptors . FMRI results reveal that this is rather attributable to alterations in social feedback processing than to decision making . The data shed light on the role of the 5‐HT system in social influence processing and are important for the development of novel treatments in psychiatric disorders ."
0.5 mg / kg	5048	intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) over	"Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine : Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment - resistant depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions . METHOD : Patients with anxious ( n = 30 ) and nonanxious TRD ( n = 20 ) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) over 12 days . Speed of processing ( SOP ) , working memory ( WM ) , verbal learning and memory ( VBM ) , visual learning and memory ( VSM ) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline , one day after the last infusion ( day 13 ) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions ( day 26 ) . A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups . Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores . RESULTS : Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 ( both p < 0.001 ) , and in VBM on day 13 ( p = 0.028 ) . However , no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD . Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD , and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD .

 BACKGROUND : Whether pretreatment working memory and response inhibition function are associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low - dose ketamine among patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) and strong suicidal ideation is unclear . METHODS : We enrolled 65 patients with TRD , comprising 33 who received a single infusion of 0.5 mg / kg ketamine and 32 who received a placebo infusion . The participants performed working memory and go / no - go tasks prior to infusion . We assessed suicidal symptoms at baseline and on postinfusion Days 2 , 3 , 5 , and 7 . RESULTS : The full remission of suicidal symptoms persisted for 3 days after a single ketamine infusion and the ketamine - related antisuicidal effect persisted for 1 week . Lower cognitive impairment at baseline ( indicated by a higher rate of correct responses on a working memory task ) was associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low - dose ketamine in patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation . DISCUSSION : Patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation but low cognitive impairment may benefit the most from the antisuicidal effect of low - dose ketamine ."

100 mcg	4506	: placebo , LSD ( 100 mcg orally ) and LSD together	"LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^ 
 Rationale : Stimulation of serotonin 2A ( 5 - HT2A ) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early , implicit , associative , and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming . However , it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo - controlled , standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5 - HT2A receptor activation . Therefore , this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5 - HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects . Methods : Twenty - five healthy subjects performed an audio - recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions : placebo , LSD ( 100 mcg orally ) and LSD together with the 5 - HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin ( 40 mg orally ) . The main outcome variable in this study was primary index ( PI ) , a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports . State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness ( 5D - ASC ) rating scale . Results : LSD , compared with placebo , significantly increased primary index ( p < 0.001 , Bonferroni - corrected ) . The LSD - induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD - induced disembodiment ( p < 0.05 , Bonferroni - corrected ) , and blissful state ( p < 0.05 , Bonferroni - corrected ) on the 5D - ASC . Both LSD - induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin . Conclusion : LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5 - HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state . Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness ."

100 mg	8307	sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA , 0.42 mg /	"The acute effects of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine and d - methamphetamine on human cognitive functioning.^ 
 RATIONALE : This study investigated the acute ( 3 - h ) and 24 - h post - dose cognitive effects of oral 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) , d - methamphetamine , and placebo in a within - subject double - blind laboratory - based study in order to compare the effect of these two commonly used illicit drugs on a large number of recreational drug users . METHODS : Sixty - one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample , with 33 females and 28 males , mean age 25.45 years . The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA , 0.42 mg / kg d - methamphetamine , or a matching placebo . The drug administration was counter - balanced , double - blind , and medically supervised . Cognitive performance was assessed during drug peak ( 3 h ) and at 24 h post - dosing time - points . Blood samples were also taken to quantify the levels of drug present at the cognitive testing time - points . RESULTS : Blood concentrations of both methamphetamine and MDMA at drug peak samples were consistent with levels observed in previous studies . The major findings concern poorer performance in the MDMA condition at peak concentration for the trail - making measures and an index of working memory ( trend level ) , and more accurate performance on a choice reaction task within the methamphetamine condition . Most of the differences in performance between the MDMA , methamphetamine , and placebo treatments diminished by the 24 - h testing time - point , although some performance improvements subsisted for choice reaction time for the methamphetamine condition . CONCLUSIONS : Further research into the acute effects of amphetamine preparations is necessary to further quantify the acute disruption of aspects of human functioning crucial to complex activities such as attention , selective memory , and psychomotor performance ."
100 µg	698	1 hour after LSD ( 100 µg p.o . ) . Outcome	"Ketanserin Reverses the Acute Response to LSD in a Randomized , Double - Blind , Placebo - Controlled , Crossover Study in Healthy Participants.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) is currently being investigated in psychedelic - assisted therapy . LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8 - 11 hours . It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5 - hydroxytryptamine-2A ( HT2A ) receptor . Administration of the 5 - HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD . However , unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD . METHODS : We used a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14 - hour sessions and received ketanserin ( 40 mg p.o . ) or placebo 1 hour after LSD ( 100 µg p.o . ) . Outcome measures included subjective effects , autonomic effects , acute adverse effects , plasma brain - derived neurotrophic factor levels , and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours . RESULTS : Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD , thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours . Ketanserin also reversed LSD - induced alterations of mind , including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution . Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain - derived neurotrophic factor levels . Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD . CONCLUSIONS : These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5 - HT2A receptors . Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD - assisted therapy .

 Background : Intranasal esketamine demonstrates rapid improvement of depressive symptoms . However , transient adverse effects ( dissociation , sedation and dizziness ) may occur , which could impact driving performance . Aims : To evaluate the effects of 84 mg intranasal esketamine on driving performance in unipolar major depressive disorder ( MDD ) or persistent depressive disorder ( PDD ) patients . Methods : The study consisted of two parts . Part A was a single - blind , double - dummy , randomized three - period , cross - over study to compare effects of esketamine versus placebo on next morning driving , 18 ± 2 h post - treatment . Alcohol was administered to demonstrate assay sensitivity . In Part B , same - day driving , 6 ± 0.5 hours post - treatment , was assessed during twice weekly esketamine administration for 3 weeks . Twenty - seven patients with mild - to - moderate MDD or PDD without psychotic features completed a 100 km on - the - road driving test on a public highway in normal traffic . The primary outcome was standard deviation of lateral position ( SDLP ; cm ; weaving of car ) . Results : In Part A , alcohol impaired driving performance compared to placebo : Least - square means ( 95 % CI ) , p - value for delta SDLP ( cm ) compared with placebo : ( ΔSDLP = + 1.83 ( 1.03 ; 2.62 ) , p < 0.001 ) , whereas esketamine did not : ( ΔSDLP = −0.23 ( −1.04 ; 0.58 ) , p = 0.572 ) . In Part B , weekly driving tests showed no differences between placebo baseline SDLP and after esketamine administration over 3 weeks : Day 11 : ( ΔSDLP = −0.96 ( −3.72 ; 1.81 ) , p = 0.493 ) , Day 18 : ( ΔSDLP = −0.56 ( −3.33 ; 2.20 ) , p = 0.686 ) and Day 25 : ( ΔSDLP = −1.05 ( −3.82 ; 1.71 ) , p = 0.451 ) . Conclusions : In this study , esketamine did not impair on - road driving performance the next morning following a single dose , or on same day after repeated administration .

0.5 mg / kg	6108	ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg / kg IV over 40 minutes in	"Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression.^ 
 Worldwide , depression carries a significant burden . Although there are effective treatments for depression , many patients do not achieve remission , and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks . The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) . There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work‐up , general anaesthesia , and the possibility of memory loss . Further , access to ECT is often limited . Comparatively , the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine . The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours , and peaks within 24 . Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration . This longitudinal , multi‐centre , randomized , crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression ( CAN‐BIND ) research program . It will take place across five sites : the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre ( lead site ) , Douglas Mental Health University Institute , Providence Care Hospital , Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network . A total of 240 participants ( accounting for 20 % dropout ) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm . Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg / kg IV over 40 minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule . Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician . Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine months , or until they leave the study or the study is terminated . Throughout the study , clinical , neuroimaging , molecular , and cognitive assessments will be conducted . Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute 's Centre for Ontario Data Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five sites . The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT , ketamine treatment produces faster therapeutic action , has less side effects , requires fewer / shorter hospitalizations for patients , and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols . Through the discovery of biomarkers to predict ECT or ketamine response or non‐response , the anticipated effective treatment could be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients , thereby ensuring a more time‐efficient intervention . Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively . Following the randomization phase , responders may move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders may move to the crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy . During the crossover phase , participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively . Following the crossover phase , responders will move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders will exit the study . During the maintenance phase , participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for one month , treatment once every two weeks for two months , and monthly treatment for three months . Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment , they may return to treatments once every two weeks . Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in order to maintain a clinical response . Both treatment arms will have a follow‐up visit during month seven ."
0.2 mg / kg	4739	. bolus of ketamine ( 0.2 mg / kg ) over 1 - 2	"A preliminary naturalistic study of low - dose ketamine for depression and suicide ideation in the emergency department.^ 
 We examined the preliminary feasibility , tolerability and efficacy of single - dose , intravenous ( i.v . ) ketamine in depressed emergency department ( ED ) patients with suicide ideation ( SI ) . Fourteen depressed ED patients with SI received a single i.v . bolus of ketamine ( 0.2 mg / kg ) over 1 - 2 min . Patients were monitored for 4 h , then re - contacted daily for 10 d. Treatment response and time to remission were evaluated using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) and Kaplan - Meier survival analysis , respectively . Mean MADRS scores fell significantly from 40.4 ( s.e.m.=1.8 ) at baseline to 11.5 ( s.e.m.=2.2 ) at 240 min . Median time to MADRS score ≤10 was 80 min ( interquartile range 0.67 - 24 h ) .

 RATIONALE : Although psilocybin and dextromethorphan ( DXM ) are hallucinogens , they have different receptor mechanisms of action and have not been directly compared . OBJECTIVE : This study compared subjective , behavioral , and physiological effects of psilocybin and dextromethorphan under conditions that minimized expectancy effects . METHODS : Single , acute oral doses of psilocybin ( 10 , 20 , 30 mg/70 kg ) , DXM ( 400 mg/70 kg ) , and placebo were administered under double - blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use . Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects . Various subjective , behavioral , and physiological effects were assessed after drug administration . RESULTS : High doses of both drugs produced similar increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength , with similar times to maximal effect and time - course . Psilocybin produced orderly dose - related increases on most participant - rated subjective measures previously shown sensitive to hallucinogens . DXM produced increases on most of these same measures . However , the high dose of psilocybin produced significantly greater and more diverse visual effects than DXM including greater movement and more frequent , brighter , distinctive , and complex ( including textured and kaleidoscopic ) images and visions . Compared to DXM , psilocybin also produced significantly greater mystical - type and psychologically insightful experiences and greater absorption in music . In contrast , DXM produced larger effects than psilocybin on measures of disembodiment , nausea / emesis , and light - headedness . Both drugs increased systolic blood pressure , heart rate , and pupil dilation and decreased psychomotor performance and balance . CONCLUSIONS : Psilocybin and DXM produced similar profiles of subjective experiences , with psilocybin producing relatively greater visual , mystical - type , insightful , and musical experiences , and DXM producing greater disembodiment ."
0.5 mg / kg	8746	a single ketamine infusion ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) .	"Antisuicidal Response Following Ketamine Infusion Is Associated With Decreased Nighttime Wakefulness in Major Depressive Disorder and Bipolar Disorder.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Insomnia and disrupted sleep are associated with increased risk of suicide . The N - methyl - d - aspartate antagonist ketamine has been associated with reduced suicidal thoughts , but the mechanism of action is unknown . This study sought to evaluate differences in nocturnal wakefulness in depressed individuals who did and did not have an antisuicidal response to ketamine . METHODS : Thirty - four participants with baseline suicidal ideation diagnosed with either DSM - IV major depressive disorder ( n = 23 ) or bipolar depression ( n = 11 ) between 2006 and 2013 completed nighttime electroencephalography ( EEG ) the night before and the night after a single ketamine infusion ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) . Suicidal ideation was assessed at baseline and the morning after ketamine infusion via several measures , including the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale suicide item , the suicide item of the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale , and the first 5 items of the Scale for Suicide Ideation . A generalized linear mixed model evaluated differences in nocturnal wakefulness , as verified by EEG , between those who had an antisuicidal response to ketamine and those who did not , controlling for baseline nocturnal wakefulness . Results were also compared to the sleep of healthy controls ( n = 22 ) . RESULTS : After analyses adjusted for baseline sleep , participants with an antisuicidal response to ketamine showed significantly reduced nocturnal wakefulness the night after ketamine infusion compared to those without an antisuicidal response ( F₁,₂₂ = 5.04 , P = .04 ) . Level of nocturnal wakefulness after antisuicidal response to ketamine did not differ significantly from nocturnal wakefulness in the control sample but did differ at a trend level ( F₁,₄₀ = 3.15 , P = .08 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Reductions in wakefulness following ketamine may point to a biological mechanism underlying the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation .

84 mg	3818	1:1 ) to ESK ( 84 mg ) or placebo nasal spray	"P.607 Esketamine nasal spray for rapid reduction of major depressive disorder symptoms in patients at imminent risk for suicide : ASPIRE-2 study.^ 
 Introduction : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) greatly increases the likelihood of suicide [ 1 ] . Available antidepressants often fail to provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation ( SI ) in acutely suicidal patients with MDD and there are currently no approved treatments for this population . In 2016 , esketamine ( ESK ) was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for MDD patients at imminent risk for suicide based on data suggesting rapid reduction in depressive symptoms , including SI observed at 4 hours after an initial dose of ESK nasal spray in a phase 2 study [ 2 ] . The efficacy and safety of ESK nasal spray is being further evaluated in ASPIRE‐2 , one of two phase 3 studies in the first global registration program in an understudied population of MDD patients , assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Methods : ASPIRE‐2 ( NCT03097133 ) is an ongoing double‐blind ( DB ) , randomised , placebo‐controlled study being conducted in Argentina , Austria , Belgium , Brazil , Canada , Czech Republic , France , Lithuania , Poland , Spain , Turkey and the United States . Adult patients ( 18 to 64 years ) with MDD ( DSM‐5 criteria , confirmed by Mini‐International Neuropsychiatric Interview [ MINI ] ) , with active SI and intent and in need of psychiatric hospitalisation were eligible . All patients received optimized standard‐of‐care ( SoC hospitalisation and initiation / optimisation of antidepressant treatment ) . Patients were randomised ( 1:1 ) to ESK ( 84 mg ) or placebo nasal spray twice‐weekly for 4 weeks , in addition to SoC. Change from baseline ( day 1 , predose ) to 24 hours after first dose in Montgomery‐Ǻsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score ( primary endpoint ) and Clinical Global Impression – Severity of Suicidality – Revised ( CGI‐SS‐R ) from the Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Assessment Tool ( SIBAT ) were assessed for efficacy . Treatment‐emergent adverse events ( TEAEs ) , potential suicidal events from the SIBAT and dissociative effects ( Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale [ CADSS ] ) were monitored for safety . Results : In total , 230 patients have been randomised to ESK+SoC or placebo+SoC ; 184 ( 80 % ) patients completed the DB treatment ( Table 1 ) . Conclusions : MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent represent a vulnerable group in need of rapid treatment of their symptoms . ASPIRE‐2 , along with ASPIRE‐1 , comprise a novel program that focuses on addressing depressive symptoms including SI in MDD patients , assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide who are typically excluded from clinical studies of antidepressants . Key efficacy and safety results from ASPIRE‐2 will be presented at the ECNP 2019 along with results from ASPIRE‐1 .

0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg	4353	which they received MDMA ( 0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg or placebo ; double blind	"The acute effects of MDMA in social contexts.^ 
 Background : The drug±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , “ ecstasy ” , “ molly ” ) is reportedly used because it increases feelings of sociability and interpersonal closeness and enhances social interaction . However , in most laboratory studies the participants are tested under relatively isolated social conditions , which may not simulate the effects of this drug in the naturalistic social setting . Methods : Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA ( 0.5 or 1.0 mg / kg or placebo ; double blind ) in one of three social conditions : solitary ( SOL , tested alone ; N=10 ) , in the presence of a research assistant ( RAP ; N=11 ) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug ( OPP ; N=11 ) . Participants were randomly assigned to the three social conditions . Cardiovascular measures and subjective effects were assessed before drug administration and repeatedly thereafter . In the RAP and OPP groups , measures of social interaction were also obtained . Results : The effects of MDMA differed across the three conditions on several measures . The drug produced the greatest effects in the OPP condition , including higher ratings of “ feel drug ” , “ dizzy ” and “ confident ” , and greater increases in cardiovascular measures , compared to the SOL or RAP conditions ( p<0.05 for all comparisons ) . Regardless of group condition , MDMA increased ratings of attractiveness of another person ( Main Effect of Dose : F(2,57)=3.6 , p<0.05 ) and increased social interaction in the RAP and OPP groups ( Main Effect of Dose : F(2,253)=8.3 , p<0.001 ) . Conclusions : These findings support a growing body of evidence showing that effects of drugs are greater when the drug is used in the presence of other drug users . It remains to be determined how MDMA and social context interact to modify its acute subjective , behavioral , and reinforcing effects ."
0.5 mg / kg	9565	intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) administered over 40 min	"Comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^ 
 Objectives : Anhedonia is a common , persistent , and disabling phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and bipolar depression ( BD ) . This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD . Methods : Ninety - seven individuals suffering from MDD ( n = 77 ) or BD ( n = 20 ) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) administered over 40 min . Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50 % and ≥ 75 % reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion , respectively . Results : Anti - anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6 % ) and 30.9 % ( 95 % confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3 % ) , respectively . When compared to baseline , a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point ( all Ps < 0.05 ) . The anti - anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups . Conclusion : This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia , with similar efficacy in MDD and BD .

 OBJECTIVE : A model has been proposed to explain the pathophysiology of mood disorders based on decreased neurotrophin levels during mood episodes ; treatment with antidepressants and mood stabilizers is associated with clinical improvement . This study investigated whether changes in brain - derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) levels are associated with the initial antidepressant effects of ketamine , a high - affinity N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist . METHOD : Twenty - three subjects aged 18 to 65 years with DSM - IV major depressive disorder ( treatment resistant ) participated in this study , which was conducted between October 2006 and May 2008 . The subjects were given an open - label intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and rated using various depression scales at baseline and at 40 , 80 , 120 , and 230 minutes postinfusion . The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale score . BDNF levels were obtained at the same time points as depression rating scale scores . RESULTS : Despite a significant ( P < . 001 ) improvement in MADRS scores after subjects received ketamine treatment , no changes in BDNF levels were observed in subjects after they received ketamine compared to baseline . Also , no association was found between antidepressant response and BDNF levels . CONCLUSIONS : This study demonstrates that ketamine 's rapid initial antidepressant effects are not mediated by BDNF . Further studies are necessary to shed light on the neurobiological basis of these effects . TRIAL REGISTRATION : clinicaltrials.gov Identifiers : NCT00024635 and NCT00088699 ."

 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , "" ecstasy "" ) is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects . MDMA releases serotonin ( 5‐HT ) , norepinephrine ( NE ) , and dopamine . It is unknown which of these monoamines mainly contributes to the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA in humans . Clonidine is a centrally acting alpha2‐receptor agonist and sympatholytic which attenuates the release of NE from presynaptic nerve terminals and also lowers NE plasma concentration . To determine the role of NE in the response to MDMA in humans we test the effects of a clonidine pretreatment on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA . We use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions . Clonidine ( 150 μg ) or placebo will be administered 1 h before the administration of MDMA ( 125 mg ) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers . Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics . We hypothesize that clonidine will significantly attenuate predominantly the cardiovascular response to MDMA ."

 IMPORTANCE : Few pharmacotherapies have demonstrated sufficient efficacy in the treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , a chronic and disabling condition . OBJECTIVE : To test the efficacy and safety of a single intravenous subanesthetic dose of ketamine for the treatment of PTSD and associated depressive symptoms in patients with chronic PTSD . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : Proof - of - concept , randomized , double - blind , crossover trial comparing ketamine with an active placebo control , midazolam , conducted at a single site ( Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai , New York , New York ) . Forty - one patients with chronic PTSD related to a range of trauma exposures were recruited via advertisements . INTERVENTIONS : Intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ) . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity , measured using the Impact of Event Scale - Revised . Secondary outcome measures included the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale , the Clinical Global Impression - Severity and -Improvement scales , and adverse effect measures , including the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale , the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale , and the Young Mania Rating Scale . RESULTS : Ketamine infusion was associated with significant and rapid reduction in PTSD symptom severity , compared with midazolam , when assessed 24 hours after infusion ( mean difference in Impact of Event Scale - Revised score , 12.7 [ 95 % CI , 2.5 - 22.8 ] ; P = .02 ) . Greater reduction of PTSD symptoms following treatment with ketamine was evident in both crossover and first - period analyses , and remained significant after adjusting for baseline and 24 - hour depressive symptom severity . Ketamine was also associated with reduction in comorbid depressive symptoms and with improvement in overall clinical presentation .

0.5 mg / kg	9173	double - infusion protocol ( 0.5 mg / kg for 40 minutes intravenously )	"Acute and Longer - Term Outcomes Using Ketamine as a Clinical Treatment at the Yale Psychiatric Hospital.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Ketamine has emerged as a rapid - acting antidepressant , though controversy remains whether sufficient data exist to justify its use outside of research protocols . In October 2014 , the authors ' institution began providing ketamine as an off - label therapy on a case - by - case basis for patients unable to participate in research protocols . Here , the participant experience during 29 months of providing ketamine as a clinical treatment for severe and treatment - resistant mood disorders through February 2017 is described . METHODS : Patients were initially treated with a single- or double - infusion protocol ( 0.5 mg / kg for 40 minutes intravenously ) and were later transitioned to a 4 - infusion protocol over 2 weeks . RESULTS : Fifty - four patients received ketamine , with 518 total infusions performed . A subset of 44 patients with mood disorders initiated the 4 - infusion protocol , of whom 45.5 % responded and 27.3 % remitted by the fourth infusion . A subsample ( n = 14 ) received ketamine on a long - term basis , ranging from 12 to 45 total treatments , over a course of 14 to 126 weeks . No evidence was found of cognitive decline , increased proclivity to delusions , or emergence of symptoms consistent with cystitis in this subsample . CONCLUSIONS : In general , ketamine infusions were tolerated well . The response and remission rates in this clinical sample were lower than those observed in some research protocols . The small number of patients who were treated on a maintenance schedule limits the conclusions that can be drawn regarding the long - term safety of ketamine ; however , no long - term adverse effects were observed in this sample ."

 Objective : To describe the tolerability of esketamine nasal spray based on the adverse event profile observed during treatment sessions occurring early and later over the course of treatment . Methods : In 2 long - term , phase 3 studies ( NCT02493868 , October 1 , 2015 - February 16 , 2018 ; NCT02497287 , September 30 , 2015 - October 28 , 2017 ) , patients with treatment - resistant major depressive disorder ( per DSM-5 ) and nonresponse to ≥ 2 oral antidepressants received esketamine nasal spray ( 56 or 84 mg ) twice weekly during a 4 - week induction phase , weekly for weeks 5 - 8 , and weekly or every 2 weeks thereafter as maintenance treatment , in conjunction with a new oral antidepressant . A post hoc analysis using descriptive statistics evaluated occurrence ( incidence , frequency , severity ) and recurrence ( incidence and severity ) of events of specific interest . Results : In patients treated with esketamine nasal spray plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant ( n = 928 ) , spontaneously reported adverse events of dizziness , nausea , sedation , vertigo , and increased blood pressure were more likely to recur after the first week of treatment if they occurred more frequently ( twice > once > none ) during the first week . The same pattern was observed when these events were assessed by structured instruments . Incidences of dizziness , dissociation , increased blood pressure , nausea , vertigo , and sedation were highest in week 1 of treatment ( 20.6 % , 16.7 % , 4.3 % , 14.0 % , 12.1 % , and 3.8 % , respectively ) and decreased thereafter . Initial occurrences and subsequent recurrences of events were mostly mild or moderate in severity . Conclusions : Adverse events during treatment with esketamine nasal spray plus an oral antidepressant generally become less frequent with ongoing treatment , and the majority are mild or moderate in severity .

1.0 mg / kg	6321	or placebo , followed by 1.0 mg / kg of IV ketamine . Adverse	"Psychotomimetic effects of single - dose ketamine in children : exploring effects of age and alpha-2 agonist pretreatment.^ 
 Background : Sub‐anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonist drugs have been used for conscious sedation and treatment of pain and depression in humans , including clinical use in children for burn management and fracture reductions where ketamine offers less respiratory depression than a commonly used combination of midazolam‐fentanyl . However , NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent , transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children . Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade ‐along with limited clinical observations‐ suggest 1 ) that NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent ( i.e. , expressed postpuberty ) and 2 ) that certain treatments ‐like alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists‐ may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity , with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha‐2 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects . We report on a double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study of the effect of the alpha‐2 agonist , dexmedetomidine , on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single‐dose , sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department ( ED ) setting . The study hypothesized 1 ) ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects , and 2 ) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a ) younger age and b ) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine . Methods : Children ages 7‐17 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized ( stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of < 12 vs. > 12 years‐of‐age children in each group ) to co‐administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures . Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone ( 0.2 mg / kg ) , medical assessments , patient stabilization , and informed consent , participants were administered dexmedetomidine ( 0.7 mcg / kg ) or placebo , followed by 1.0 mg / kg of IV ketamine . Adverse events were recorded using a clinician‐administered adverse events and side effects scale . The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children ( BPRSC ) was administered prior to ketamine dose , during ketamine treatment , and again prior to discharge from the emergency room , with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre‐ketamine to on‐ketamine condition . Cognitive testing was obtained following on‐ketamine BPRS ratings . Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA ( ANCOVA when baseline values were non‐zero ) , using time as the repeated measure ( pre‐ vs. during ketamine ) , and treatment condition ( dexmedetomidine vs. saline ) and age ( < 12 vs. > 12 ) as independent variables . Results : Forty children ( mean age : 11.0 years ( SD = 2.3 years ) , 70.0 % male , 22.5 % black ) were randomized to ketamine+saline ( n = 18 ) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine ( n= 22 ) . Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects , consistent with prior reports of dose‐dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans . BPRS positive symptoms ( hallucinations , delusions , peculiar fantasies ) , absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment , were manifested during ketamine treatment , as indicated by a significant main effect of time ( F[1,36 ] = 19.98 , p<0.0001 ) . A trend‐level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed ( F[1,36]=3.93 , p = 0.055 ) , explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre‐treatment . Frequently reported ( > 5 % , baseline‐corrected ) side effects were sedation ( 56.3 % ) , dizziness ( 50.0 % ) , “ pleasant ” dreams ( 31.4 % ) and visual hallucinations ( 29.7 % ) . Conclusions : The results of this study indicate that singledose , sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well‐controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures , with generally well‐tolerated adverse events , consistent with prior reports . However , ketamine treatment in children , as in adults , is associated with psychotomimetic effects . Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1 ) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2 ) that pretreatment with alpha‐2 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain . Future studies are needed to better characterize these effects ."

 BACKGROUND : Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial impact on daily functioning that lacks sufficient treatment options . Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA - assisted psychotherapy for PTSD . METHODS : Six randomized , double - blind , controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017 . Active doses of MDMA ( 75 - 125 mg , n = 72 ) or placebo / control doses ( 0 - 40 mg , n = 31 ) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8 - h sessions spaced a month apart . Three non - drug 90 - min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure , and three to four followed each experimental session . RESULTS : After two blinded experimental sessions , the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS - IV total scores from baseline than the control group [ MMRM estimated mean difference ( SE ) between groups - 22.0 ( 5.17 ) , P < 0.001 ] . The between - group Cohen 's d effect size was 0.8 , indicating a large treatment effect . After two experimental sessions , more participants in the active group ( 54.2 % ) did not meet CAPS - IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group ( 22.6 % ) . Depression symptom improvement on the BDI - II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group , although only trended towards significant group differences [ MMRM , estimated mean difference ( SE ) between groups - 6.0 ( 3.03 ) , P = 0.053 ] . All doses of MDMA were well tolerated , with some expected reactions occurring at greater frequency for the active MDMA group during experimental sessions and the 7 days following . CONCLUSIONS : MDMA - assisted psychotherapy was efficacious and well tolerated in a large sample of adults with PTSD .

 Decision - making , i.e. selecting an action from a number of alternatives when the outcome is uncertain , is a complex process that is important for everyday life . 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) , also known as ' Ecstasy ' , is a widely used recreational drug that is known to increase serotonin ( 5 - HT ) and , to a lesser extent , dopamine ( DA ) in animals . This study examined whether MDMA alters decision - making in a way that depends on the degree of success and outcome . Forty - two normal , healthy volunteers were given placebo or 1.5mg / kg p.o . MDMA in a randomized crossover design . Subjects completed the two - choice prediction task 120min after administration of the drug . Decision - making characteristics were obtained at 20 % error rate , 50 % error rate or 80 % error rate . MDMA affected decision - making via a process that is dependent on success or failure . Administration of MDMA increased the degree to which the previous response predicted the current response ( mutual information ) and the average response sequence predictability ( average dynamical entropy ) at low error rates . MDMA increased the degree to which the previous stimulus influenced the selection of the current response at 20 % , 50 % or 80 % error rate . MDMA did not significantly alter basic response characteristics such as response latency or switching . Self - assessment of the psychological state induced by MDMA did not predict the MDMA induced decision - making patterns . These results support the hypothesis that acute administration of MDMA affects success - related response selection during decision - making ."

 INTRODUCTION : Misattribution of distorted self - generated speech in patients with schizophrenia has been associated with increased lateral temporal activation . As a pharmacological model of schizophrenia , we tested whether ketamine would induce the same effects in healthy individuals . METHODS : Participants were 8 healthy male volunteers who were naïve to ketamine ( mean age : 28 years ) . Ketamine ( 0.23 mg / kg bolus followed by 0.64 mg / kg / h ) and placebo infusions were administered in a double - blind , randomised order , during 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) sessions . Each fMRI session consisted of a verbal self - monitoring task in which auditory feedback was experimentally modified . RESULTS : Ketamine was associated with psychotic and dissociative symptoms . Participants made more misattributions of distorted self - generated speech ( P < 0.02 ) during the ketamine infusion . Ketamine led to reduced activation in the left superior temporal cortex during self - distorted speech , regardless of whether the speech was identified correctly or not , as compared to the placebo infusion . Misidentification of speech that had been distorted was not associated with any increase in brain activation in during the placebo infusion , however ketamine - induced misattributions were associated with a relative increase in left superior temporal cortex activation . DISCUSSION : These data are consistent with the notion that self - monitoring impairments underlie psychotic symptoms and suggest that N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor dysfunction may mediate self - monitoring deficits and psychotic phenomena in schizophrenia ."

 BACKGROUND : Stress is prevalent in people experiencing suicidality and is a major contributor to the development of mental disorders . Evidence suggests ketamine shows capacity to reverse stress - induced brain changes . Though stress and ketamine have been explored individually for suicidality , this study is the first to examine ketamine treatment for self - reported stress in adults with chronic suicidality , building on pre - clinical evidence of ketamine 's capacity to normalize stress - induced responses and contributing to our understanding of oral ketamine in clinical populations . METHODS : Thirty two adult participants ( 22 - 72 years ; 17 female ) with chronic suicidality completed 6 weeks of active treatment , receiving low ( 0.5 mg / kg - 3.0 mg / kg ) doses of oral ketamine once per week , with a 4 - week follow - up phase , to assess the effect of ketamine on their perceived stress . Stress was measured via self - report utilizing the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale-21(DASS-21 ) , and analysed at pre - treatment ( week 0 ) , post - treatment ( week 6 ) and at follow - up ( week 10 ) . RESULTS : Repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant reduction in stress ( p<.001 ) post - treatment and Reliable Change Index calculations confirmed this to be clinically significant . Furthermore , those classified as ' prolonged responders ' demonstrated a sustained reduction in stress at follow - up ( i.e. after 4 weeks of nil ketamine ) . LIMITATIONS : Small sample size , open label design , expectancy , secondary analysis CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine showed the capacity to produce a robust and sustained improvement in stress symptoms , in people with chronic suicidality .

 This study evaluates the effects of ketamine on healthy and schizophrenic volunteers ( SVs ) in an effort to define the detailed behavioral effects of the drug in a psychosis model . We compared the effects of ketamine on normal and SVs to establish the comparability of their responses and the extent to which normal subjects might be used experimentally as a model . Eighteen normal volunteers ( NVs ) and 17 SVs participated in ketamine interviews . Some ( n = 7 NVs ; n = 9 SVs ) had four sessions with a 0.1 - 0.5 mg / kg of ketamine and a placebo ; others ( n = 11 NVs ; n = 8 SVs ) had two sessions with one dose of ketamine ( 0.3 mg / kg ) and a placebo . Experienced research clinicians used the BPRS to assess any change in mental status over time and documented the specifics in a timely way . In both volunteer groups , ketamine induced a dose - related , short ( < 30 min ) increase in psychotic symptoms . The scores of NVs increased on both the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) psychosis subscale ( p = .0001 ) and the BPRS withdrawal subscale ( p = .0001 ) , whereas SVs experienced an increase only in positive symptoms ( p = .0001 ) . Seventy percent of the patients reported an increase ( i.e. , exacerbation ) of previously experienced positive symptoms . Normal and schizophrenic groups differed only on the BPRS withdrawal score . The magnitude of ketamine - induced changes in positive symptoms was similar , although the psychosis baseline differed , and the dose - response profiles over time were superimposable across the two populations . The similarity between ketamine - induced symptoms in SVs and their own positive symptoms suggests that ketamine provides a unique model of psychosis in human volunteers . The data suggest that the phencyclidine ( PCP ) model of schizophrenia maybe a more valid human psychosis / schizophrenia drug model than the amphetamine model , with a broader range of psychotic symptoms .

 Recently , low - dose ketamine has been proposed as a rapid - acting treatment option for suicidality . The majority of studies to date have utilised intravenous ( IV ) ketamine , however , this route of administration has limitations . On the other hand , oral ketamine can be administered in a range of settings , which is important in treating suicidality , although studies as to safety and feasibility are lacking . n = 32 adults ( aged 22 - 72 years ; 53 % female ) with chronic suicidal thoughts participated in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality ( OKTOS ) , an open - label trial of sub - anaesthetic doses of oral ketamine over 6 weeks . Participants commenced with 0.5 mg / kg of ketamine , which was titrated to a maximum 3.0 mg / kg . Follow - up assessments occurred at 4 weeks after the final dose . The primary outcome measure was the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation ( BSS ) and secondary measures included scales for suicidality and depressive symptoms , and measures of functioning and well - being . Mean BSS scores significantly reduced from a high level of suicidal ideation at the pre - ketamine ( week 0 ) timepoint to below the clinical threshold at the post - ketamine ( week 6 ) timepoint .

 Recently , low - dose ketamine has been proposed as a rapid - acting treatment option for suicidality . The majority of studies to date have utilised intravenous ( IV ) ketamine , however , this route of administration has limitations . On the other hand , oral ketamine can be administered in a range of settings , which is important in treating suicidality , although studies as to safety and feasibility are lacking . n = 32 adults ( aged 22 - 72 years ; 53 % female ) with chronic suicidal thoughts participated in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality ( OKTOS ) , an open - label trial of sub - anaesthetic doses of oral ketamine over 6 weeks . Participants commenced with 0.5 mg / kg of ketamine , which was titrated to a maximum 3.0 mg / kg . Follow - up assessments occurred at 4 weeks after the final dose . The primary outcome measure was the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation ( BSS ) and secondary measures included scales for suicidality and depressive symptoms , and measures of functioning and well - being . Mean BSS scores significantly reduced from a high level of suicidal ideation at the pre - ketamine ( week 0 ) timepoint to below the clinical threshold at the post - ketamine ( week 6 ) timepoint . The proportion of participants that achieved clinical improvement within the first 6 weeks was 69 % , whereas 50 % achieved a significant improvement by the follow - up ( week 10 ) timepoint . Six weeks of oral ketamine treatment in participants with chronic suicidality led to significant reduction in suicidal ideation .

 The N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid onset activity in treatment - resistant depression , post - traumatic stress disorder and obsessive compulsive disorder . Due to similarities in brain network activity in depression and anxiety disorders , we hypothesized that ketamine might also be active in other refractory anxiety disorders . We evaluated the efficacy and safety of ketamine in 12 patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder who were not currently depressed , using an ascending single dose study design ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 mg / kg administered subcutaneously ) at weekly intervals . Within 1 h of dosing , patients reported reduced anxiety , which persisted for up to seven days . A dose - response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects , dissociative side effects , and changes in blood pressure and heart rate , with minor changes at 0.25 mg / kg , and progressively greater and more durable changes at the higher doses . Ten of 12 patients were treatment responders at 0.5 - 1 mg / kg . Ketamine was safe and well tolerated in this population . Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic alternative for patients with refractory generalized anxiety disorder / social anxiety disorder . Along with its demonstrated effectiveness in patients with treatment - resistant depression , obsessive compulsive disorder and post - traumatic stress disorder , these data raise the intriguing possibility that ketamine may have broad efficacy in disorders characterized by negative emotional states , and that these disorders may share a common precipitating neurobiology ."

 BACKGROUND : The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression . Thus , modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression , though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood . METHODS : This double - blind , crossover , placebo - controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug - free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v . infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) as well as an i.v . saline placebo . Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions . During scanning , participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger . Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale . Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α - amino-3 - hydroxy-5 - methyl-4 - isoxazole propionic acid ( AMPA)- and N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses . RESULTS : Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine - mediated NMDA - blockade sensitization , with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model . Within our major depressive disorder subject group , ketamine efficacy , as measured by improved mood ratings , correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network . CONCLUSIONS : These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA - mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and , further , that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA - mediated connectivity in vivo .

 Objectives : Migraine is a common presentation in adolescents and children in emergency departments ( EDs ) and inpatient visits . It is often treated with nonsteroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs , dopamine receptor antagonists , triptans , or dihydroergotamine . Some cases , however , are refractory to traditional medications and options become narrowed [ 1,2 ] . Restricting therapy further , dihydroergotamine is currently on indefinite shortage [ 3 ] . Ketamine , a lipophilic , rapid‐acting , N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist , has emerged as a promising therapeutic option [ 4,5 ] . Excitatory glutamate signaling may be inhibited by ketamine via NMDA antagonism . This action could suppress cortical spreading depression(CSD ) and alleviate migraines with and without aura [ 5 ] . Reports in mixed migraine patient populations described statistically significant pain score reductions ( 7.1 to 3.8 ; p<0.0001 ) with intermittent intravenous ketamine[6 ] and diminished severity with ketamine infusions ( 0.12‐0.42 mg / kg / hour)[7 ] without serious adverse effects ( AEs ) [ 6,7 ] . Intranasal ( IN ) ketamine 25 mg in migraine patients with prolonged aura demonstrated statistically significant reduced aura severity ( p=0.032 ) [ 4 ] . Reports of efficacy and safety with IN ketamine ( 0.3‐0.5 mg / kg / dose ) in pediatric patients with various pain diagnoses have been published [ 8‐13 ] , but pediatric migraine data with IN ketamine is lacking . Given minimal evidence and therapeutic options , our experience with IN ketamine was recorded to better understand potential efficacy and safety . Methods : A retrospective case series was performed in 8 pediatric patients ( 12‐17 years old ) with refractory migraine who received IN ketamine between December 2016 and February 2017 . In total , 11 encounters were recorded . Pain scores were obtained utilizing a 0‐10 numeric pain scale [ 14 ] . Ketamine 0.1‐0.2 mg / kg / dose ( mean=0.15 mg / kg / dose ) was administered intranasally every 15 minutes ( maximum : 5 doses ) . Results : Migraine resolution was seen in 63.6 % of encounters ( n=7/11 ) ; most responders achieved their lowest pain score with dose four or five ( n=5/7 ; 71.4 % ) . Mean pain reduction from admission to ketamine completion for responders was‐6.8 . Non‐responders ( n=4 ) saw only‐0.5 reduction . Mean migraine duration at presentation was longer in responders versus non‐responders ( 44.6 versus 4 days ) . Responders also had a nearly 50 % shorter mean length of stay ( LOS ) compared to non‐responders ( 2.4 versus 4.75 days , respectively ) . Ketamine was initiated in the ED for 7 encounters ; 3 ( 42.9 % ) avoided inpatient admission . Vitals were monitored during and 1 hour post‐ketamine administration . The following transient abnormalities were noted : prehypertensive blood pressure[15 ] ( n=8 ; 72.7 % ) ; mild tachycardia[16 ] ( n=4 ; 36.4 % ) ; dizziness ( n=2 ; 18.2 % ) ; and dysphoria ( n=1 ; 9.1 % ) . No serious AEs or readmissions within 72 hours were reported . Conclusion : Intranasal ketamine appears to be safe and effective for pediatric migraine treatment , particularly in patients with prolonged migraine .

 BACKGROUND : Psilocybin has shown promise as a treatment for depression but its therapeutic mechanisms are not properly understood . In contrast to the presumed actions of antidepressants , we recently found increased amygdala responsiveness to fearful faces one day after open - label treatment with psilocybin ( 25 mg ) in 19 patients with treatment - resistant depression , which correlated with treatment efficacy . AIMS : Aiming to further unravel the therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin , the present study extends this basic activation analysis . We hypothesised changed amygdala functional connectivity , more precisely decreased amygdala - ventromedial prefrontal cortex functional connectivity , during face processing after treatment with psilocybin . METHODS : Psychophysiological interaction analyses were conducted on functional magnetic resonance imaging data from a classic face / emotion perception task , with the bilateral amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex time - series as physiological regressors . Average parameter estimates ( beta weights ) of significant clusters were correlated with clinical outcomes at one week . RESULTS : Results showed decreased ventromedial prefrontal cortex - right amygdala functional connectivity during face processing post- ( versus pre- ) treatment ; this decrease was associated with levels of rumination at one week . This effect was driven by connectivity changes in response to fearful and neutral ( but not happy ) faces . Independent whole - brain analyses also revealed a post - treatment increase in functional connectivity between the amygdala and ventromedial prefrontal cortex to occipital - parietal cortices during face processing . CONCLUSION : These results are consistent with the idea that psilocybin therapy revives emotional responsiveness on a neural and psychological level , which may be a key treatment mechanism for psychedelic therapy . Future larger placebo - controlled studies are needed to examine the replicability of the current findings ."

 IMPORTANCE : A single subanesthetic dose of ketamine produces an antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) within hours , but the mechanism of antidepressant effect is uncertain . OBJECTIVE : To evaluate whether ketamine dose and brain glutamate and glutamine ( Glx ) and γ - aminobutyric acid ( GABA ) level responses to ketamine are related to antidepressant benefit and adverse effects . DESIGN , SETTING , AND PARTICIPANTS : This randomized , parallel - group , triple - masked clinical trial included 38 physically healthy , psychotropic medication - free adult outpatients who were in a major depressive episode of MDD but not actively suicidal . The trial was conducted at Columbia University Medical Center . Data were collected from February 2012 to May 2015 . Data analysis was conducted from January to March 2020 . INTERVENTION : Participants received 1 dose of placebo or ketamine ( 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 , or 0.5 mg / kg ) intravenously during 40 minutes of a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan that measured ventro - medial prefrontal cortex Glx and GABA levels in 13 - minute data frames . MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES : Clinical improvement was measured using a 22 - item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-22 ) 24 hours after ketamine was administered . Ketamine and metabolite blood levels were measured after the scan . RESULTS : A total of 38 individuals participated in the study , with a mean ( SD ) age of 38.6 ( 11.2 ) years , 23 ( 60.5 % ) women , and 25 ( 65.8 % ) White patients . Improvement in HDRS-22 score at 24 hours correlated positively with ketamine dose ( t36 = 2.81 ; P = .008 ; slope estimate , 19.80 [ 95 % CI , 5.49 to 34.11 ] ) and blood level ( t36 = 2.25 ; P = .03 ; slope estimate , 0.070 [ 95 % CI , 0.007 to 0.133 ] ) . The lower the Glx response , the better the antidepressant response ( t33 = -2.400 ; P = .02 ; slope estimate , -9.85 [ 95 % CI , -18.2 to -1.50 ] ) . Although GABA levels correlated with Glx ( t33 = 8.117 ; P < .001 ; slope estimate , 0.510 [ 95 % CI , 0.382 to 0.638 ] ) , GABA response did not correlate with antidepressant effect . When both ketamine dose and Glx response were included in a mediation analysis model , ketamine dose was no longer associated with antidepressant effect , indicating that Glx response mediated the relationship . Adverse effects were related to blood levels in men only ( t5 = 2.606 ; P = .048 ; estimated slope , 0.093 [ 95 % CI , 0.001 to 0.186 ] ) , but Glx and GABA response were not related to adverse effects . CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE : In this study , intravenous ketamine dose and blood levels correlated positively with antidepressant response . The Glx response correlated inversely with ketamine dose and with antidepressant effect . Future studies are needed to determine whether the relationship between Glx level and antidepressant effect is due to glutamate or glutamine .

 Antidepressants require several weeks for the onset of action , a lag time that may exceed life expectancy in palliative care . Ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects , but has been minimally studied in cancer and palliative care populations . Herein , the objective was to determine the feasibility , safety , tolerability and preliminary efficacy of intranasal racemic ketamine for major depressive disorder ( MDD ) in patients with advanced cancer . We conducted a single - arm , open - label phase II trial at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto , ON , Canada . Participants with advanced cancer with moderate to severe MDD received three flexible doses of intranasal ( IN ) ketamine ( 50−150 mg ) over a one - week period . The primary efficacy outcome was an antidepressant response and remission rates as determined by the Montgomery−Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) from baseline to the Day 8 primary endpoint . Twenty participants were enrolled in the trial , receiving at least one dose of IN ketamine , with fifteen participants receiving all three doses . The Day 8 antidepressant response ( MADRS decreased by > 50 % ) and remission ( MADRS < 10 on Day 8) rates were high at 70 % and 45 % , respectively . Mean MADRS scores decreased significantly from baseline ( mean MADRS of 31 , standard deviation 7.6 ) to Day 8 ( 11 + /− 7.4 ) with an overall decrease of 20 points ( p < 0.001 ) . Antidepressant effects were partially sustained in the second week in the absence of additional ketamine doses , with a Day 14 mean MADRS score of 14 + /− 9.9 . Common adverse effects included fatigue , dissociation , nausea , dysgeusia and headaches ; almost all adverse effects were mild and transient , resolving within 2 h of each ketamine dose with one dropout related to adverse effects ( negative dissociative episode ) . Given these promising findings , larger , controlled trials are merited ."
0.5 mg / kg	2538	infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and one infusion of	"Ketamine as a rapid treatment for chronic ptsd : clinical effects and potential biological mechanisms.^ 
 Background : Chronic stress and posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) have been linked to glutamate system dysfunction . A sub‐anesthetic dose of ketamine , an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor antagonist , previously shown to be rapidly effective for treatment‐resistant depression , has been proposed as a potential PTSD treatment . Methods : In a randomized , double‐blind , crossover trial , 41 patients with chronic PTSD , assessed with the SCID‐P and CAPS , were assigned to receive one intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) and one infusion of midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ) , two weeks apart , in randomized counterbalanced order . The primary outcome was improvement on the Impact of Event Scale‐Revised ( IES‐R ) 24 hours post‐infusion . Additional measures included the CAPS , Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , Clinical Global Severity Scales ( CGI ) , among others . Results : PTSD symptom improvement after ketamine infusion was rapid and significantly better than after midazolam , measured 24 hours post‐infusion ( mean difference in IES‐R score = 12.7 [ 95 % CI : 2.5‐22.8 ] , p = .02 , in analysis of crossover data ) . Analyses of PTSD symptom improvement after the first infusion , and after adjusting for baseline and 24‐hour depressive symptoms , paralleled this finding . Ketamine infusion was also associated with improvement in comorbid depressive symptoms and GCI scores , with short‐lived , non‐clinically significant dissociative symptoms . Conclusions : Results provide the first evidence of rapid improvement in core PTSD symptoms after ketamine infusion in chronic PTSD patients . Implications for future pharmacologic approaches in patients with chronic PTSD will be discussed , as well as potential biological mechanisms underlying the effects of ketamine in this disabling chronic condition ."

1.5 mg / kg	9446	In session 2 , a 1.5 mg / kg MDMA dose was given at	"Sex differences in 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^ 
 BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE : 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ; ecstasy ) is a ring - substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes . MDMA is predominantly O - demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 ( CYP ) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism - based inhibitor of the enzyme . This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half - life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration . These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects . STUDY DESIGN : Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions . Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days , with a minimum of 3 days between sessions . In session 1 , subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg . In session 2 , a 1.5 mg / kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours , followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days . METHODS : Plasma concentration - time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan ( DOR ) , 3 - methoxymorphinan ( MM ) and hydroxymorphinan-3 - ol ( HM ) were measured . RESULTS : MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10 - fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration ( C(max ) ) and area under the plasma concentration - time curve ( AUC ) , with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters . The mean ± SD C(max ) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng / mL , with a time to reach C(max ) ( t(max ) ) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h / mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9 % with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1 % after 1.5 mg / kg of MDMA ( p = 0.0001 ) . The metabolic ratio ( MR ) increased almost 60 - fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration , with 100 % of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor - metabolizer phenotype . Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan / DOR MR in the 0- to 8 - hour ( session 1 ) and 4- to 12 - hour ( session 2 , post MDMA ) collection periods ( p = 0.032 and p = 0.01 , respectively ) . CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90 % of baseline activity , with a recovery half - life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours . Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half - life ( 27.6 ± 25.1 hours ) . The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non - significant increase in C(max ) and AUC values of MM after drug intake , but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan / MM MR in both sexes , although the difference was more pronounced in women . Dextromethorphan / MM MR increased almost 3 - fold from baseline . DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION : In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance . CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90 % of baseline activity . Regarding CYP3A4 activity , there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use . In women , MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs , some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates . MDMA - induced mechanism - based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance , and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6 ."
0.215 mg / kg	8923	single , moderate dose ( 0.215 mg / kg body weight ) of psilocybin	"Single - dose psilocybin - assisted therapy in major depressive disorder : A placebo - controlled , double - blind , randomised clinical trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel , rapid - acting treatment for depression . Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open - label setting or when compared to a waiting list group . To date , to our knowledge , no other trial compared a single , moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition . METHODS : In this double - blind , randomised clinical trial , 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single , moderate dose ( 0.215 mg / kg body weight ) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support . MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity , while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints . The trial took place between April 11th , 2019 and October 12th , 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich , Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT03715127 ) . FINDINGS : The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition ( 95 % CI -15.0 to -1.3 ; Cohens ' d = 0.97 ; P = 0.0011 ; MADRS ) and -13.2 points ( 95 % CI ; -13.4 to -1.3 ; Cohens ' d = 0.67 ; P = 0.019 ; BDI ) 14 days after the intervention . 14/26 ( 54 % ) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition . INTERPRETATION : These results suggest that a single , moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks . No serious adverse events were recorded . Larger , multi - centric trials with longer follow - up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm . FUNDING : The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation , Crowdfunding , the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation , and the Heffter Research Institute ."

0.5 mg / kg	9566	with six ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . Levels of anhedonia	"Association of VEGF with antianhedonic effects of repeated - dose intravenous ketamine in treatment - refractory depression.^ 
 Objectives : To first explore the role of plasma vascular endothelial growth factor ( VEGF ) concentrations in ketamine 's antianhedonic effects , focusing on Chinese patients with treatment - refractory depression ( TRD ) . Methods : Seventy - eight patients with treatment - refractory major depressive disorder ( MDD ) or bipolar disorder ( BD ) were treated with six ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg ) . Levels of anhedonia were measured using the Montgomery – Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) anhedonia item at baseline , day 13 and 26 . Plasma VEGF concentrations were examined at the same time points as the MADRS . Results : Despite a significant reduction in anhedonia symptoms in individuals with treatment - refractory MDD ( n = 59 ) or BD ( n = 19 ) after they received repeated - dose ketamine infusions ( p < 0.05 ) , no significant changes in plasma VEGF concentrations were found at day 13 when compared to baseline ( p > 0.05 ) . The alteration of plasma VEGF concentrations did not differ between antianhedonic responders and non - responders at days 13 and 26 ( all ps > 0.05 ) . Additionally , no significant correlations were observed between the antianhedonic response to ketamine and plasma VEGF concentrations ( all ps > 0.05 ) . Conclusion : This preliminary study suggests that the antianhedonic effects of ketamine are not mediated by VEGF . ( PsycInfo Database Record ( c ) 2023 APA , all rights reserved )"
0.2 mg / kg	2245	received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg / kg body weight p. o. oral	"Psilocybin induces aberrant prediction error processing for tactile mismatch responses.^ 
 Background : The skin as the body 's largest organ is our first contact point with the environment encoding information of many different sources as well as providing a sense of boundaries and the Self / Non‐Self discrimination – thus forming a backdrop of all perceptual experiences [ 1 ] . Predictive codes integrating bodily states and sensory inputs may give rise to self‐awareness and a sense of agency . Distortions in these processes have been linked to psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenic delusions [ 2 ] . However , the relationship between altered tactile prediction error ( PE ) processing and distorted self‐experience and its underlying neuropharmacology have never been empirically studied . Therefore , we investigated the effect of the preferential 5‐HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin ( Psi ) , known to induce alterations in self‐experience , on the processing of tactile mismatch responses by using functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) . Methods : In this cross‐over , double‐blind , within‐subject , randomized and placebo‐controlled study , fifteen healthy participants ( 8 males , and 7 females , aged between 20–40 years ) received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg / kg body weight p. o. oral administration of the 5‐HT2A/1A agonist Psi . Participants completed a roving oddball task while undergoing fMRI 85 minutes after Psi / Pla administration during peak of subjective Psi effects . To induce tactile mismatch responses , trains of stimuli switched randomly between high ( double pulse ) and low ( single pulse ) intensity after a variable number of 3 to 7 repetitions , generating an unpredictable sequence . The first stimulus of each train was modelled as the “ Deviant ( D ) "" and the third repetition of each train as “ Standard "" ( S ) . All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using a MR‐safe electrode and a constant current stimulator ( Digitimer , DS7AH ) . The fMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in the SPM12 software package . The dependent variables were the fMRI BOLD contrasts D > S. Subjective effects were measured using the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale ( 5D‐ASC ) . 5D‐ASC scores were analyzed by using a repeated‐measures ANOVA design with treatment condition ( Pla and Psi ) and scale as within‐subject factors . Results : In response to unpredicted stimuli significant decreases in brain activity after Psi administration were detected for the D > S contrast in areas previously implicated in body awareness and tactile deviancy processing : thalamus , primary somatosensory cortex , midcingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus . Further , Psi produced robust perceptual alterations of bodily awareness and self‐experience assessed with the rating scale 5D‐ASC . Conclusion : This study shows that Psi alters the integration of tactile stimuli through aberrant PE signalling , potentially the underlying mechanism of Psi‐induced alterations of self and body‐experience . Furthermore , it points to the important role of the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes in the processes of self‐experience . This finding may be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders compromised by distorted self‐experience ."
2 mg	4786	occasion ( placebo ) and 2 mg psilocybin on the other .	"Finding the self by losing the self : Neural correlates of ego - dissolution under psilocybin.^ 
 Ego - disturbances have been a topic in schizophrenia research since the earliest clinical descriptions of the disorder . Manifesting as a feeling that one 's "" self , "" "" ego , "" or "" I "" is disintegrating or that the border between one 's self and the external world is dissolving , "" ego - disintegration "" or "" dissolution "" is also an important feature of the psychedelic experience , such as is produced by psilocybin ( a compound found in "" magic mushrooms "" ) . Fifteen healthy subjects took part in this placebo - controlled study . Twelve - minute functional MRI scans were acquired on two occasions : subjects received an intravenous infusion of saline on one occasion ( placebo ) and 2 mg psilocybin on the other . Twenty - two visual analogue scale ratings were completed soon after scanning and the first principal component of these , dominated by items referring to "" ego - dissolution "" , was used as a primary measure of interest in subsequent analyses . Employing methods of connectivity analysis and graph theory , an association was found between psilocybin - induced ego - dissolution and decreased functional connectivity between the medial temporal lobe and high - level cortical regions . Ego - dissolution was also associated with a "" disintegration "" of the salience network and reduced interhemispheric communication . Addressing baseline brain dynamics as a predictor of drug - response , individuals with lower diversity of executive network nodes were more likely to experience ego - dissolution under psilocybin . These results implicate MTL - cortical decoupling , decreased salience network integrity , and reduced inter - hemispheric communication in psilocybin - induced ego disturbance and suggest that the maintenance of "" self""or "" ego , "" as a perceptual phenomenon , may rest on the normal functioning of these systems ."
75 mg	4650	- treatment and MDMA ( 75 mg ) as treatment . Behavioural	"MDMA - induced indifference to negative sounds is mediated by the 5 - HT(2A ) receptor.^ 
 BACKGROUND : MDMA has been shown to induce feelings of sociability , a positive emotional bias and enhanced empathy . While previous research has used only visual emotional stimuli , communication entails more than that single dimension and it is known that auditory information is also crucial in this process . In addition , it is , however , unclear what the neurobiological mechanism underlying these MDMA effects on social behaviour is . Previously , studies have shown that MDMA - induced emotional excitability and positive mood are linked to the action on the serotonin ( 5 - HT ) 2A receptor . AIM : The present study aimed at investigating the effect of MDMA on processing of sounds ( Processing of Affective Sounds Task ( PAST ) ) and cognitive biases ( Approach - Avoidance Task ( AAT ) ) towards emotional and social stimuli and the role of 5 - HT(2A ) receptor in these effects . METHODS : Twenty healthy recreational users entered a 2 × 2 , placebo - controlled , within - subject study with ketanserin ( 40 mg ) as pre - treatment and MDMA ( 75 mg ) as treatment . Behavioural ( PAST , AAT ) measures were conducted 90 min after treatment with MDMA , respectively , 120 min after ketanserin . Self - report mood measures and oxytocin concentrations were taken at baseline and before and after behavioural tests . RESULTS : Findings showed that MDMA reduced arousal elicited by negative sounds . This effect was counteracted by ketanserin pre - treatment , indicating involvement of the 5 - HT(2 ) receptor in this process . MDMA did not seem to induce a bias towards emotional and social stimuli . It increased positive and negative mood ratings and elevated oxytocin plasma concentrations . The reduction in arousal levels when listening to negative sounds was not related to the elevated subjective arousal . CONCLUSION : It is suggested that this decrease in arousal to negative stimuli reflects potentially a lowering of defences , a process that might play a role in the therapeutic process ."

 BACKGROUND : We previously reported that ketamine has anxiolytic effects in patients with treatment - resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders . AIMS : The purpose of this study was to replicate our earlier report about ketamine 's anxiolytic activity , using a more robust study design . METHODS : This was a double - blind , psychoactive - controlled ascending dose study in 12 patients with treatment - resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders who were not currently depressed . Ascending doses of ketamine ( 0.25 , 0.5 , 1 mg / kg ) were administered at weekly intervals , and midazolam 0.01 mg / kg , the control , was randomly inserted into the ketamine dose sequence . Assessments included ratings of anxiety and dissociation , safety and tolerability , and blood samples for ketamine pharmacokinetics and BDNF concentrations . RESULTS : Improvements in anxiety ratings occurred within an hour of ketamine dosing , and persisted for up to 1 week . A dose - response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects , dissociative side effects , and changes in blood pressure and heart rate after ketamine dosing . Midazolam had minor brief effects on anxiety ratings . Ketamine was safe and well tolerated . Ketamine pharmacokinetics were correlated with dissociation ratings . Serum BDNF concentrations declined over time and were similar for all treatments . CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine may be a potential therapeutic option for patients with treatment - resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders ."

 RATIONALE : 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy . Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention - deficit / hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy , respectively , but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers . Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant - type substances compared directly within the same subjects . METHODS : We investigated the acute autonomic , subjective , endocrine , and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA ( 125 mg ) , methylphenidate ( 60 mg ) , modafinil ( 600 mg ) , and placebo in a double - blind , cross - over study in 24 healthy participants . Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales , the Facial Emotion Recognition Task ( FERT ) , and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory ( SADI ) . RESULTS : All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects . MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation , subjective good drug effects , drug liking , happiness , trust , well - being , and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil . Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT . On the SADI , only MDMA produced sexual arousal - like effects . Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol , prolactin , and oxytocin . In contrast to MDMA , methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety , and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT . Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects . CONCLUSIONS : MDMA induced subjective , emotional , sexual , and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used ."
0.5 mg / kg	2535	six infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or midazolam ( 0.045	"A Randomized Controlled Trial of Repeated Ketamine Administration for Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a chronic and disabling disorder , for which available pharmacotherapies have limited efficacy . The authors ' previous proof - of - concept randomized controlled trial of single - dose intravenous ketamine infusion in individuals with PTSD showed significant and rapid PTSD symptom reduction 24 hours postinfusion . The present study is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for the treatment of chronic PTSD . METHODS : Individuals with chronic PTSD ( N=30 ) were randomly assigned ( 1:1 ) to receive six infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or midazolam ( 0.045 mg / kg ) ( psychoactive placebo control ) over 2 consecutive weeks . Clinician - rated and self - report assessments were administered 24 hours after the first infusion and at weekly visits . The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity , as assessed with the Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 ( CAPS-5 ) , from baseline to 2 weeks ( after completion of all infusions ) . Secondary outcome measures included the Impact of Event Scale - Revised , the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , and side effect measures . RESULTS : The ketamine group showed a significantly greater improvement in CAPS-5 and MADRS total scores than the midazolam group from baseline to week 2 . At week 2 , the mean CAPS-5 total score was 11.88 points ( SE=3.96 ) lower in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group ( d=1.13 , 95 % CI=0.36 , 1.91 ) . Sixty - seven percent of participants in the ketamine group were treatment responders , compared with 20 % in the midazolam group . Among ketamine responders , the median time to loss of response was 27.5 days following the 2 - week course of infusions . Ketamine infusions were well tolerated overall , without serious adverse events . CONCLUSIONS : This randomized controlled trial provides the first evidence of efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions in reducing symptom severity in individuals with chronic PTSD . Further studies are warranted to understand ketamine 's full potential as a treatment for chronic PTSD ."

 BACKGROUND : Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users . Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of ± 3,4 metylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) . The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments . The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known . We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol , implicated in the regulation of memory performance , can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA . METHODS : In the present study , we aimed to block the MDMA - induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor ( metyrapone ) together with a single dose of MDMA . Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo - controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions . The treatments consisted of MDMA ( 75 mg ) and metyrapone ( 750 mg ) , alone and in combination , and double placebo . Pre - treatment with metyrapone or Placebo occurred 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration . Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests . Cortisol levels were determined in blood and oral fluid ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective . RESULTS : Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA - induced increase in cortisol levels in blood , it did not prevent the MDMA - induced memory deficit from happening . CONCLUSION : We therefore conclude that MDMA - induced increments in cortisol concentrations are not related to MDMA - induced memory impairments ."

80 mg or 120 mg	6121	doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol	"A Multi - Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA - Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^ 
 PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person 's daily life . PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war , disaster , sexual abuse , violence , terrorism , and accidents . PTSD negatively impacts a person 's daily life , resulting in relationship difficulties , difficulty in finding and maintaining a job , reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning , substance abuse , high‐cost healthcare use , and increased depression and suicide risk . Available PTSD treatments , including medications and therapy , effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration . People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies . In the past decade , there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD . 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is a drug that releases serotonin , norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin , arginine vasopressin and cortisol . The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion , reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury , and enhance communication and introspection . MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects , which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy .

 The goal of this study was to infer the effectiveness of midazolam as a comparator in preserving the blind in ketamine studies for mood disorders through patient - level analyses of efficacy trial outcomes . In this integrative data analysis ( k = 9 , N = 367 patients with mood disorders ) , clinical outcomes were compared across four groups : ketamine ( midazolam - controlled ) , ketamine ( saline - controlled ) , midazolam , and saline . Ketamine doses ranged from 0.5 to 0.54 mg / kg and midazolam doses ranged from 0.02 to 0.045 mg / kg . The baseline - to - Day 1 effect size was d = 0.7 ( 95 % CI : 0.4 - 0.9 ) for ketamine ( midazolam ) versus midazolam and d = 1.8 ( 95 % CI : 1.4 - 2.2 ) for ketamine ( saline ) versus saline . The effect of ketamine relative to control was larger in saline - controlled studies than in midazolam - controlled studies ( t(276 ) = 2.32 , p = 0.02 ) . This was driven by a comparatively larger effect under midazolam than saline ( t(111 ) = 5.40 , p < 0.0001 ) , whereas there was no difference between ketamine ( midazolam ) versus ketamine ( saline ) ( t(177 ) = 0.65 , p = 0.51 ) . Model - estimated rates of response ( with 95 % CI ) yielded similar results : ketamine ( midazolam ) , 45 % ( 34 - 56 % ) ; ketamine ( saline ) , 46 % ( 34 - 58 % ) ; midazolam , 18 % ( 6 - 30 % ) ; saline , 1 % ( 0 - 11 % ) . The response rate for ketamine was higher than the control condition for both saline ( t(353 ) = 7.41 , p < 0.0001 ) and midazolam ( t(353 ) = 4.59 , p < 0.0001 ) . Studies that used midazolam as a comparator yielded smaller effects of ketamine than those which used saline , which was accounted for by greater improvement following midazolam compared to saline ."
100 µg	7753	over study , LSD ( 100 µg ) and placebo were administered	"Acute LSD effects on response inhibition neural networks.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Recent evidence shows that the serotonin 2A receptor ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine2A receptor , 5 - HT2AR ) is critically involved in the formation of visual hallucinations and cognitive impairments in lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD)-induced states and neuropsychiatric diseases . However , the interaction between 5 - HT2AR activation , cognitive impairments and visual hallucinations is still poorly understood . This study explored the effect of 5 - HT2AR activation on response inhibition neural networks in healthy subjects by using LSD and further tested whether brain activation during response inhibition under LSD exposure was related to LSD - induced visual hallucinations . METHODS : In a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , cross - over study , LSD ( 100 µg ) and placebo were administered to 18 healthy subjects . Response inhibition was assessed using a functional magnetic resonance imaging Go / No - Go task . LSD - induced visual hallucinations were measured using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness ( 5D - ASC ) questionnaire . RESULTS : Relative to placebo , LSD administration impaired inhibitory performance and reduced brain activation in the right middle temporal gyrus , superior / middle / inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex and in the left superior frontal and postcentral gyrus and cerebellum . Parahippocampal activation during response inhibition was differently related to inhibitory performance after placebo and LSD administration . Finally , activation in the left superior frontal gyrus under LSD exposure was negatively related to LSD - induced cognitive impairments and visual imagery . CONCLUSION : Our findings show that 5 - HT2AR activation by LSD leads to a hippocampal - prefrontal cortex - mediated breakdown of inhibitory processing , which might subsequently promote the formation of LSD - induced visual imageries . These findings help to better understand the neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of visual hallucinations in LSD - induced states and neuropsychiatric disorders ."
25 mg	8219	three studies using a fixed 25 mg dose of psilocybin delivered in	"Body mass index ( BMI ) does not predict responses to psilocybin.^ 
 Background : Psilocybin is a serotonin type 2A ( 5 - HT2A ) receptor agonist and naturally occurring psychedelic . 5 - HT2A receptor density is known to be associated with body mass index ( BMI ) , however , the impact of this on psilocybin therapy has not been explored . While body weight - adjusted dosing is widely used , this imposes a practical and financial strain on the scalability of psychedelic therapy . This gap between evidence and practice is caused by the absence of studies clarifying the relationship between BMI , the acute psychedelic experience and long - term psychological outcomes . Method : Data were pooled across three studies using a fixed 25 mg dose of psilocybin delivered in a therapeutic context to assess whether BMI predicts characteristics of the acute experience and changes in well - being 2 weeks later . Supplementing frequentist analysis with Bayes Factors has enabled for conclusions to be drawn regarding the null hypothesis . Results : Results support the null hypothesis that BMI does not predict overall intensity of the altered state , mystical experiences , perceptual changes or emotional breakthroughs during the acute experience . There was weak evidence for greater ‘ dread of ego dissolution ’ in participants with lower BMI , however , further analysis suggested BMI did not meaningfully add to the combination of the other covariates ( age , sex and study ) . While mystical - type experiences and emotional breakthroughs were strong predictors of improvements in well - being , BMI was not . Conclusions : These findings have important implications for our understanding of pharmacological and extra - pharmacological contributors to psychedelic - assisted therapy and for the standardization of a fixed therapeutic dose in psychedelic - assisted therapy ."

 Methylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , midomafetamine ) owing to its similar effects among users . Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry ( i.e. , methylone is a β - keto analog of MDMA ) and mechanisms of action . Currently , the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans . Herein , we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions . Seventeen participants of both sexes ( 14 males , 3 females ) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover clinical trial . Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone , 100 mg of MDMA , and a placebo . The variables included physiological effects ( blood pressure , heart rate , oral temperature , pupil diameter ) , subjective effects using visual analog scales ( VAS ) , the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory ( ARCI ) , the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire ( VESSPA - SSE ) , and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire ( SDRQ ) , and psychomotor performance ( Maddox wing , psychomotor vigilance task ) . We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects , such as stimulation , euphoria , wellbeing , enhanced empathy , and altered perception . Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA , with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects . These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans .

100 mg	1286	) paradigm after ingestion of 100 mg of MDMA - HCl or	"The effect of acutely administered MDMA on subjective and BOLD - fMRI responses to favourite and worst autobiographical memories.^ 
 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is a potent monoamine - releaser that is widely used as a recreational drug . Preliminary work has supported the potential of MDMA in psychotherapy for post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The neurobiological mechanisms underlying its putative efficacy are , however , poorly understood . Psychotherapy for PTSD usually requires that patients revisit traumatic memories , and it has been argued that this is easier to do under MDMA . Functional magnetic resonance imaging ( fMRI ) was used to investigate the effect of MDMA on recollection of favourite and worst autobiographical memories ( AMs ) . Nineteen participants ( five females ) with previous experience with MDMA performed a blocked AM recollection ( AMR ) paradigm after ingestion of 100 mg of MDMA - HCl or ascorbic acid ( placebo ) in a double - blind , repeated - measures design . Memory cues describing participants ' AMs were read by them in the scanner . Favourite memories were rated as significantly more vivid , emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo and worst memories were rated as less negative . Functional MRI data from 17 participants showed robust activations to AMs in regions known to be involved in AMR . There was also a significant effect of memory valence : hippocampal regions showed preferential activations to favourite memories and executive regions to worst memories . MDMA augmented activations to favourite memories in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and somatosensory cortex and attenuated activations to worst memories in the left anterior temporal cortex . These findings are consistent with a positive emotional - bias likely mediated by MDMA 's pro - monoaminergic pharmacology ."

 Quantifying neural activity in natural conditions ( i.e. conditions comparable to the standard clinical patient experience ) during the administration of psychedelics may further our scientific understanding of the effects and mechanisms of action . This data may facilitate the discovery of novel biomarkers enabling more personalized treatments and improved patient outcomes . In this single - blind , placebo - controlled study with a non - randomized design , we use time - domain functional near - infrared spectroscopy ( TD - fNIRS ) to measure acute brain dynamics after intramuscular subanesthetic ketamine ( 0.75 mg / kg ) and placebo ( saline ) administration in healthy participants ( n = 15 , 8 females , 7 males , age 32.4 ± 7.5 years ) in a clinical setting . We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology ( e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity ) . Furthermore , ketamine led to a brain - wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations , and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region . Lastly , we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology . Overall , our study demonstrated the successful application of fNIRS neuroimaging to study the physiological effects of the psychoactive substance ketamine in humans , and can be regarded as an important step toward larger scale clinical fNIRS studies that can quantify the impact of psychedelics on the brain in standard clinical settings ."
200 μg	7739	crossover study , LSD ( 200 μg ) and placebo were administered	"Acute Effects of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide in Healthy Subjects.^ 
 BACKGROUND : After no research in humans for > 40 years , there is renewed interest in using lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) in clinical psychiatric research and practice . There are no modern studies on the subjective and autonomic effects of LSD , and its endocrine effects are unknown . In animals , LSD disrupts prepulse inhibition ( PPI ) of the acoustic startle response , and patients with schizophrenia exhibit similar impairments in PPI . However , no data are available on the effects of LSD on PPI in humans . METHODS : In a double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover study , LSD ( 200 μg ) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects ( 8 women , 8 men ) . Outcome measures included psychometric scales ; investigator ratings ; PPI of the acoustic startle response ; and autonomic , endocrine , and adverse effects . RESULTS : Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours . The predominant effects induced by LSD included visual hallucinations , audiovisual synesthesia , and positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena . Subjective well - being , happiness , closeness to others , openness , and trust were increased by LSD . Compared with placebo , LSD decreased PPI . LSD significantly increased blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature , pupil size , plasma cortisol , prolactin , oxytocin , and epinephrine . Adverse effects produced by LSD completely subsided within 72 hours . No severe acute adverse effects were observed . CONCLUSIONS : In addition to marked hallucinogenic effects , LSD exerts methylenedioxymethamphetamine - like empathogenic mood effects that may be useful in psychotherapy . LSD altered sensorimotor gating in a human model of psychosis , supporting the use of LSD in translational psychiatric research . In a controlled clinical setting , LSD can be used safely , but it produces significant sympathomimetic stimulation ."

 BACKGROUND : The N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine is potentially effective in treatment resistant depression . However , its antidepressant efficacy is highly variable , and there is little information about predictors of response . METHODS : We employed growth mixture modeling ( GMM ) analysis to examine specific response trajectories to intravenous ( IV ) ketamine ( three infusions ; mean dose 0.63 mg / kg , SD 0.28 , range 0.30 - 2.98 mg / kg over 40 min ) in 328 depressed adult outpatients referred to a community clinic . The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self - Report ( QIDS - SR ) assessed depression severity at baseline and before each infusion , up to three infusions for four total observations . RESULTS : GMM revealed three QIDS - SR response trajectories . There were two groups of severely depressed patients , with contrasting responses to ketamine . One group ( n=135 , baseline QIDS - SR=18.8 ) had a robust antidepressant response ( final QIDS - SR=7.3 ) ; the other group ( n=97 , QIDS - SR=19.8 ) was less responsive ( final QIDS - SR=15.6 ) . A third group ( n=96 ) was less severely depressed at baseline ( QIDS - SR=11.7 ) , with intermediate antidepressant response ( final QIDS - SR=6.6 ) . Comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between groups with severe baseline depression revealed higher childhood physical abuse in the group with robust ketamine response ( p=0.01 ) . LIMITATIONS : This was a retrospective analysis on a naturalistic sample . Patients were unblinded and more heterogenous than those included in most controlled clinical trial samples . Information pertaining to traumatic events occurring after childhood and pre - existing or concurrent medical conditions that may have affected outcomes was not available .

 Background : 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , ? ecstasy ? ) is widely used recreationally . However , MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder . This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers . Methods : The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled , cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects ( 82 females ) receiving a single dose of 125 mg of MDMA . Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale ( 5D‐ASC ) administered once after the drug effect , and a series of visual analogue scales ( VASs ) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve ( AUEC0‐6h ) . Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo ( Δ ) . Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration . Results : MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC . However , the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small ( Δ5D‐ASC total score , % mean±SD ] 13±11 ; p<.001 ) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity ( Δrating score , % mean±SD : 37±32 and 21±26 , respectively ; both p<.001 ) .

25 mg	4885	one high - dose ( 25 mg ) group psilocybin session ,	"HOPE : A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients With Cancer.^ 
 CONTEXT / OBJECTIVES : Psilocybin - assisted psychotherapy shows promise in treating depression and existential distress in people with serious medical illness . However , its individual - based methodology poses challenges for scaling and resource availability . The HOPE trial ( A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer ) is an Institutional Review Boards - approved open - label feasibility and safety pilot study examining psilocybin - assisted group therapy in cancer patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder ( including major depressive disorder as well as adjustment disorder with depressed mood ) . We report here the safety and clinical outcome measures including six - months follow up data . METHODS : Outcome measures were collected at baseline , two - weeks and 26 - weeks postintervention . The study involved three group preparatory sessions , one high - dose ( 25 mg ) group psilocybin session , and three group integration sessions with cohorts of four participants over a three - week intervention . RESULTS : Twelve participants completed the trial . no serious adverse events attributed to psilocybin occurred . The primary clinical outcome measures of change in symptoms of depression on the clinician administered 17 - item - HAM - D showed clinically substantial decrease in HAM - D scores from baseline to the two - week timepoint ( 21.5 - 10.09 , P < 0.001 ) and the 26 - week timepoint ( 21.5 - 14.83 , P = 0.006 ) . Six out of 12 participants met criteria for remission at two weeks , as defined by HAM - D < 7 , three out 12 demonstrated a clinically significant change ( 4 - 6 points ) , and eight out of twelve demonstrated a clinically substantial change ( 7 - 12 points ) . CONCLUSION : This pilot study demonstrated the safety , feasibility , and possible efficacy of psilocybin - assisted group therapy for cancer patients dealing with depressive symptoms . Based on demonstrated efficacy and significant reductions in therapist time , future investigations with the group therapy model are warranted ."

 About 21 % of Taiwanese patients with major depression developed treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) during 1 - year follow - up in Taiwan . TRD was commonly coupled with functional impairment , poor quality of life , suicide ideation and attempts , self - injurious behaviors , and a high relapse rate . From 2012 and 2015 , we had conducted the first randomized , double - blind , placebo control trial in Asian countries to examine the therapeutic efficacy of a single low - dose ketamine infusion in Taiwanese patients with TRD . Seventy one subjects were evenly distributed in three dose groups with 0.5 mg / kg , 0.2 mg / kg , and placebo , respectively . Responder was identified by response ( ≥ 50 % reduction of mood ratings ) at any two daily HAMD measures during the period of 24 - 96 h ( day 2 - 5 ) post - ketamine infusion . There was a significant difference in the response rate across the three groups ( 0.5 mg / kg : 45.8 % ; 0.2 mg / kg : 39.1 % ; placebo : 12.5 % ; p = 0.03 ) , which is much lower than that in the Caucasians ( 70 % ) . Two factors might be related : lower serum ketamine levels and lower Val / Val allele percentage in BDNF Val66Met genotyping found in the Taiwanese patients . In addition to the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine , a greater antisuicidal effect ( 59 % ) was also identified . The former may only account for 52.7 % of the latter , indicating that the antisuicidality may be independent from antidepressiveness . Single dose of ketamine only resulted in short - lived psychedelic / dissociation adverse effect , which was resolved within 2 h post - infusion . Up to present , no long - term side effects were identified , given a single - dose administration . Using 18F - FDG - PET scanning and 24 h post - ketamine infusion , glucose metabolism of the prefrontal cortex ( PFC ) , supplementary motor area ( SMA ) , and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex ( dACC ) were activated immediately ( 40 min post - infusion ) , and activation of SMA and dACC could sustain for 1 day , which may contribute to the persistent antidepressant effect of ketamine beyond its half - life , suggesting that a short activation in the PFC engendered by ketamine infusion may be a kindler , facilitating the persistent increase in glucose metabolism in the SMA and dACC ; therefore , the PFC may be still considered to play a key role in improving TRD . These findings were also supported by a simple wearable forehead EEG monitoring from baseline to 40 min post - infusion , revealing that ketamine may increase the theta and low alpha power and decrease asymmetry in the PFC . Finally , a maintenance trial in a double - blind , randomized fashion using a partial NMDA agonist , d - cycloserine ( DCS ) vs. placebo , was conducted in the ketamine responders .

0.5 mg / kg	558	subanesthetic infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) .	"Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion : relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Suicide is a psychiatric emergency . Currently , there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation . Ketamine is an N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety , but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known . The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts , independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms . METHODS : 133 patients with treatment - resistant depression ( major depressive disorder or bipolar I / II disorder ) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) . Post - hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAMD ) , Scale for Suicidal Ideation ( SSI ) , Beck Depression Inventory ( BDI ) , and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale ( HAMA ) focusing on 230 min post - infusion . RESULTS : At 230 min post - infusion , correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 ( p < .05 ) , accounting for up to 19 % in the variance of ideation change . Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 ( p < .05 ) , accounting for similar levels of variance . Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo , when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression ( F1,587 = 10.31 , p = .001 ) and anxiety ( F1,567 = 8.54 , p = .004 ) . CONCLUSIONS : Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to , but not completely driven by , improvements in depression and anxiety . Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted ."

 The concept of self and self - referential processing has a growing explanatory value in psychiatry and neuroscience , referring to the cognitive organization and perceptual differentiation of self - stimuli in health and disease . Conditions in which selfhood loses its natural coherence offer a unique opportunity for elucidating the mechanisms underlying self - disturbances . We assessed the psychoactive effects of psilocybin ( 230 μg / kg p.o . ) , a preferential 5 - HT1A/2A agonist known to induce shifts in self - perception . Our placebo - controlled , double - blind , within - subject crossover experiment ( n = 17 ) implemented a verbal self - monitoring task involving vocalizations and participant identification of real - time auditory source- ( self / other ) and pitch - modulating feedback . Subjective experience and task performance were analyzed , with time - point - by - time - point assumption - free multivariate randomization statistics applied to the spatiotemporal dynamics of event - related potentials . Psilocybin - modulated self - experience , interacted with source to affect task accuracy , and altered the late phase of self - stimuli encoding by abolishing the distinctiveness of self- and other - related electric field configurations during the P300 timeframe . This last effect was driven by current source density changes within the supragenual anterior cingulate and right insular cortex . The extent of the P300 effect was associated with the intensity of psilocybin - induced feelings of unity and changed meaning of percepts . Modulations of late encoding and their underlying neural generators in self - referential processing networks via 5 - HT signaling may be key for understanding self - disorders . This mechanism may reflect a neural instantiation of altered self - other and relational meaning processing in a stimulus - locked time domain . The study elucidates the neuropharmacological foundation of subjectivity , with implications for therapy , underscoring the concept of connectedness ."

 The cognitive and motor effects of alcohol drinking are influenced by a family history of alcoholism . Some data suggest that individuals with a family history of alcoholism(family history positive [ FHP ] ) are less affected and intoxicated by alcohol , as compared to those without such a history ( family history negative [ FHN ] ) . Our group has used ketamine as a pharmacological probe to study alcoholism , since ( a ) both alcohol and ketamine inhibit N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate ( NMDA ) glutamate receptor function and ( b ) ketamine has alcohol‐like effects . The purpose of the study was to evaluate cognitive and motor effects of ketamine in FHP and FHN subjects . Ninety‐nine non‐alcohol‐dependent healthy subjects with ( FHP ; n = 29 ) and without a family history of alcoholism(FHN ; n = 70 ) were recruited . The subjects weremales and females aged 21 to 30 years who had no lifetime Axis I psychiatric or substance use disorders . In this randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled , crossover study , subjects received either intravenous ketamine ( 0.81 mg / kg ) or placebo ( saline ) during two separate test sessions scheduled 3 days apart . Cognitive function was evaluated by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test . Motor coordination function was evaluated by the Grooved Pegboard Test . During the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test , ketamine impaired both total recall ( medication effect : p < 0.0001 ) and delayed recall ( medication effect : p < 0.0001 ) compared with placebo . There was a statistical trend ( family history x medication effect : p = 0.0667 ) showing that FHP subjects ( placebo : 10.3 ; ketamine : 7.7 ) were less impaired than FHN subjects ( placebo : 10.2 ; ketamine : 6.2 ) in delayed recall after ketamine infusion . During the Grooved Pegboard Test , ketamine impaired motor coordination in both dominant hand ( medication x time effect : p < 0.0001 ) and non‐dominant hand ( medication x time effect : p < 0.0001 ) compared with placebo . There was a statistical trend ( family history x medication x time effect : p = 0.0596 ) showing that FHP subjects ( pre‐ketamine : 59.8 sec ; post‐ketamine : 81.8 sec ) were less impaired than FHN subjects ( pre‐ketamine : 59.5 sec ; post‐ketamine : 92.9 sec ) in motor coordination performance after ketamine infusion ( in dominant hand ) . In summary , our findings using ketamine as a pharmacological probe suggest that FHP subjects may be less sensitive to the cognitive and motor effects of alcohol compared to FHN subjects ."

 Ecstasy ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , MDMA ) is a psychoactive recreational drug widely used by young people visiting dance parties , and has been associated with poor cognitive function . The current study assessed the influence of a single dose of MDMA 75 mg and alcohol 0.5 g / kg on cognition , psychomotor performance and driving - related task performance . Twelve healthy recreational ecstasy users participated in an experimental study conducted according to a double - blind , double - dummy , placebo - controlled three - way cross - over design . MDMA improved psychomotor performance , such as movement speed and tracking performance in a single task , as well as in a divided attention task . MDMA impaired the ability to predict object movement under divided attention . However , the inability to accurately predict object movement after MDMA may indicate impairment of particular performance skills relevant to driving . There was no effect of MDMA on visual search , planning or retrieval from semantic memory ."

 Ketamine , in research settings , rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts 2 - 24 h after a single infusion in patients with high suicidal ideation . In this study , the authors investigate ketamine 's effects on suicidality in a real - world sample of recent suicide attempters on a tertiary - care Consultation - Liaison ( CL ) psychiatry service . Using an open - label design , 16 transdiagnostic CL patients were recruited , 18 - 65 years old , to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) in the acute medical setting . All were psychiatrically hospitalized post - infusion . Baseline suicidality and depression measures were compared to ratings taken at 24 h , 5 days , 12 days , and 1 , 3 and 6 months post - infusion using paired t - tests . Across all measures , rapid , statistically significant decreases ( p 's < 0.001 ) were observed with large to very large effect sizes ( Cohen 's d 's : 1.7 - 8.8 ) at acute timepoints ( 24 h ; 5 days ) . These gains were uniformly maintained to 6 months post - infusion . Open - label ketamine appeared to rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra - high - risk , heterogeneous , real - world sample . Ketamine infusion may therefore be a safe , feasible , viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among medically hospitalized patients after a suicide attempt , with potentially enduring benefits . The current pilot findings suggest ketamine could be readily integrated into the settings where high - risk CL patients already receive healthcare , with the potential to become an important and novel tool in the treatment of suicidality ."

 Background / aims : To report preliminary results from the KODIAC study , designed to evaluate the effect of intravenous ketamine for patients with cancer diagnosed with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) and undergoing palliative care ( PC ) . Methods : KODIAC is a randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled clinical study which evaluated the effects of an intravenous dose of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) compared with placebo and escalating dose of escitalopram in patients diagnosed with MDD by a specialized psychiatrist . The primary outcome was depression as per the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale ( BEDS ) 3 weeks post‐intervention . This study is registered at clinicaltrials.gov ( NCT04471818 ) . Results : Currently , 50 % of the calculated sample has been accrued . Eight patients ( n=4 controls ; n=4 experimental ) completed the study . Baseline characteristics were similar among both study groups , as well as baseline BEDS scores . Mean BEDS scores showed improvement as early as 1‐week post‐intervention . At three weeks post intervention , patients included in the experimental arm had a significant reduction in mean BEDS depression scores compared with patients in the control arm ( 3 [ SD : 2.160 ] vs. 11.75 [ SD:3.594 ] ; p=0.006 ) . The most common adverse event was post‐infusion drowsiness and nausea . No serious adverse events were reported . Conclusions : Preliminary results from this study highlight that ketamine is a rapid onset and robust potentializing anti‐depressant for patients with cancer and MDD undergoing palliative care . These preliminary observations require confirmation once the study completes accrual but shed light on the potent effect and safety profile of ketamine for this patient population , warranting further investigation should the final findings be consistent ."

 Background : After no official research in humans in the last 40 years , research and therapeutic uses of the serotonergic psychedelic lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) are now re‐recognized and include its use in brain research , alcoholism , anxiety associated with terminal illness , and treatment of headache disorders . Specifically , LSD has been reported to abort attacks , to decrease frequency and intensity of attacks , and to induce remission in patients suffering from cluster headache ( CH ) . Objective : To investigate the effects of an oral LSD pulse regimen ( 3 x 100 µg LSD in three weeks ) in patients suffering from CH compared with placebo . Design : Double‐blind , randomized , placebo‐controlled two‐phase cross‐over study design . Participants : 30 patients aged ≥ 25 and ≤ 75 years with chronic or episodic CH with predictable periods lasting approximately 2 months and attacks responding to oxygen . Main outcome measures : Changes in frequency and intensity of CH attacks assessed with a standardized headache diary Significance : CH is often rated as the most painful of all primary headaches , which not only causes significant disability , but is also associated with enormous personal , economic , and psychiatric burden . At the moment , there is no specific treatment available for CH , but serotonergic compounds represent an important drug class , especially in the abortive management of cluster attacks . However , there is a need for new treatment approaches , as CH is also often insufficiently managed with available medication .

 Introduction Depressive symptoms have surfaced as the principal mental health concern among patients with breast cancer , with surgical interventions potentially exacerbating these symptoms and adversely influencing clinical outcomes . This study protocol is designed to investigate the efficacy of low‐dose esketamine administered perioperatively on depressive symptoms in patients with breast cancer . It also aims to illuminate the potential neurobiological underpinnings of this effect . Methods and analysis This research represents a single‐centre , prospective , randomised , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study . The trial anticipates enrolling 108 female patients exhibiting mild‐to‐severe depressive symptoms who are slated for radical mastectomy . Through stratified randomisation , eligible patients will be systematically assigned to either the esketamine group ( 0.25 mg / kg ) or placebo group ( 0.9 % saline ) in a 1:1 ratio . The primary outcome is the response rate at the third postoperative day . Secondary outcomes encompass the remission rate , depression‐related scores , depression severity and safety‐related endpoints .

0.8 mg / kg	6302	immediate effects of ketamine ( 0.8 mg / kg per hour during 80 minutes	"Using ketamine to model semantic deficits in schizophrenia.^ 
 Semantic deficits constitute a core cognitive abnormality in schizophrenia . In the current study , the N - methyl - d - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine was administered to healthy individuals acutely while they performed semantic processing tasks that included word pairs of differing degrees of semantic relatedness . Two dimensions of semantic processing were investigated : ( 1 ) explicit versus implicit processing , that is , unconscious versus conscious processing of semantic relationships and ( 2 ) direct versus indirect processing , that is , word pairs that are closely ( LION - TIGER ) or distantly ( LION - STRIPES ) related . The immediate effects of ketamine ( 0.8 mg / kg per hour during 80 minutes with approximate target plasma levels of 200 ng / mL ) were examined in a placebo - controlled double - blind repeated - measures group design with 19 participants . It was predicted that ketamine would disrupt access to semantic memory as evidenced in schizophrenia , especially the indirectly related word pairs . In addition , implicit processing and explicit processing were predicted to be differentially affected . Ketamine administration did result in an abnormal performance in the reaction time responses to implicitly presented indirectly related word pairs ( ie , greater priming ) and reduced accuracy for explicit pairs . Performance on the directly related word pair tasks ( both implicit and explicit ) was similar across ketamine and placebo conditions , except for the suggestion of abnormal semantic matching in the accuracy data in the implicit task . This study confirms that implicit indirect semantic processing is changed under the influences of ketamine akin to schizophrenia . Future research comparing a schizophrenia group and a ketamine group directly about these tasks is needed to determine the similarity of impairments ."

 The aim of the present study was to clarify the neurophysiological changes associated with analgesic and behavioral effects of low - dose ketamine HCl in patients suffering from chronic neuropathic pain . Ten in - patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single - blind , placebo - controlled study after giving written informed consent . Following intravenous injections of a saline solution ( placebo ) , three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals . Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain . Behavioral changes , including psychotomimetic effects , were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS ) . Electroencephalograms ( EEG ) and electrooculograms ( EOG ) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period . One minute EEG and closed - eye eye movements were quantified . The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials . Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine - induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS . Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency . The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief . Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements , but did not initiate slow eye movements . In conclusion , the present EEG - EOG / behavioral results indicate that ketamine - induced failure of neural integration between cortical - subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain ."

 The 30 - item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire ( MEQ30 ) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical - type experiences occasioned by psilocybin - containing mushrooms . The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire . The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin . Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants ( n=184 ) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin ( at least 20 mg/70 kg ) . Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30 . Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes , behavior , and well - being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant - rated intensity of drug effects . These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences . A method to score a "" complete mystical experience "" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30 , and a stand - alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research ."

 Background : Headache disorders maintain top worldwide disability ratings , urging the continued investigation of novel targets and mechanisms of treatment . Anecdotal evidence suggests that psilocybin , lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , and other select indoleamine 5‐hydroxytryptamine 2A ( 5‐HT2A ) receptor ligands confer sustained therapeutic benefit in cluster and migraine headache , though controlled studies are lacking . We sought to carry out the first controlled investigations of the effects and safety of psilocybin in these headache disorders . Methods : Two exploratory clinical trials were carried out in adult males and females with migraine or cluster headache ( twelve each ) . The migraine design was a double‐blind , placebocontrolled , cross‐over study and the cluster design was a randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study . Migraine subjects received single administrations of oral placebo ( microcrystalline cellulose ) and psilocybin ( 0.143 mg / kg ) two weeks apart . Cluster subjects were randomized to receive a pulse regimen of three administrations of either psilocybin ( 0.143 mg/ kg ) or placebo , each administration separated by approximately 5 days . Headache diaries , in which subjects documented headache attacks , began two weeks before the first test day and ended two weeks after the second test day for migraine subjects and two months after the last test day for cluster subjects . Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessionsand several follow‐up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures . Ten subjects in each the migraine and cluster studies were included in the final analysis . Results : Over the 2‐week period after single drug administration , the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin [ ‐1.65 ( 95 % CI : ‐2.53 to ‐0.77 ) days / week ] than after placebo [ ‐0.15 ( ‐1.13 to 0.83 ) days/ week ; p = 0.003 , t(9 ) = 4.11 ; effect size ‐1.15 ] . Over the 3‐week period after initiating the pulse regimen , the reduction in weekly cluster attacks from baseline was greater with psilocybin [ ‐6.03 ( ‐9.96 to ‐2.10 ) ] than with placebo [ +1.17 ( ‐2.76 to 5.10 ) ; p = 0.017 , t(8 ) = 2.99 ; effect size ‐1.89 ] . In neither study did the rating of psychedelic effects during acute psilocybin exposure correlate with the change in headache burden . Psilocybin was welltolerated in both studies and there were no unexpected or serious adverse events . Conclusions : These two exploratory controlled trials showed that limited administration of a low oral dose of psilocybin has sustained therapeutic effects in migraine and cluster headache . These findings validate the potential value of psilocybin in headache research and medicine . That the reductions in headache burden were not correlated with acute psychedelic effects in these studies urges the consideration of the several neurobiological functions common to both headache pathology and the known actions of select 5‐HT2A receptor ligands as potential sources of therapeutic effects in headache ."

Cluster subjects were randomized to receive a pulse regimen of three administrations of either psilocybin ( 0.143 mg/ kg ) or placebo , each administration separated by approximately 5 days . Headache diaries , in which subjects documented headache attacks , began two weeks before the first test day and ended two weeks after the second test day for migraine subjects and two months after the last test day for cluster subjects . Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessionsand several follow‐up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures . Ten subjects in each the migraine and cluster studies were included in the final analysis . Results : Over the 2‐week period after single drug administration , the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin [ ‐1.65 ( 95 % CI : ‐2.53 to ‐0.77 ) days / week ] than after placebo [ ‐0.15 ( ‐1.13 to 0.83 ) days/ week ; p = 0.003 , t(9 ) = 4.11 ; effect size ‐1.15 ] . Over the 3‐week period after initiating the pulse regimen , the reduction in weekly cluster attacks from baseline was greater with psilocybin [ ‐6.03 ( ‐9.96 to ‐2.10 ) ] than with placebo [ +1.17 ( ‐2.76 to 5.10 ) ; p = 0.017 , t(8 ) = 2.99 ; effect size ‐1.89 ] . In neither study did the rating of psychedelic effects during acute psilocybin exposure correlate with the change in headache burden . Psilocybin was welltolerated in both studies and there were no unexpected or serious adverse events . Conclusions : These two exploratory controlled trials showed that limited administration of a low oral dose of psilocybin has sustained therapeutic effects in migraine and cluster headache . These findings validate the potential value of psilocybin in headache research and medicine . That the reductions in headache burden were not correlated with acute psychedelic effects in these studies urges the consideration of the several neurobiological functions common to both headache pathology and the known actions of select 5‐HT2A receptor ligands as potential sources of therapeutic effects in headache ."

 Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is a debilitating disorder that develops after people undergo a traumatic event , such as a rape , car accident or other life‐threatening event . PTSD is a worldwide health problem . Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD , but there is an interest in developing other treatment options . 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment . MDMA is known as the active ingredient in "" ecstasy . "" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past , and a study suggests that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD . This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic , treatment‐resistant posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . After open‐label lead‐in in two subjects there will be a randomized , double‐blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants , and an open‐label arm for participants who received active placebo . In this study , five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125 . mg MDMA . MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart . Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study . Subjects must be in good physical health . They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms , symptoms of depression and sleep quality . These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions .

0.25 mg / kg	9381	to receive intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg diluted to 5 ml with	"Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery : A double - blind , randomized clinical trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Postpartum depression ( PPD ) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period . Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time . In recent years , ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration . We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery . METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study trail , healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9 % saline ) or placebo ( 5 ml of 0.9 % saline ) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord . The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms , which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS , a threshold of 9/10 was used ) at 1 week , 2 weeks , and 1 month after delivery . The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale ( NRS ) score of pain at 2 days postpartum . This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry , number ChiCTR1900022464 . RESULTS : Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019 , 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated : 165 ( 50 % ) to the ketamine group and 165 ( 50 % ) to the placebo group . There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum ( 13.1 % vs. 22.6 % , respectively ; p = .029 ) .

0.25 mg / kg	9381	: Operative intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg ) can reduce the postpartum	"Intraoperative ketamine for reduction in postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery : A double - blind , randomized clinical trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Postpartum depression ( PPD ) is a common mental disease happens in perinatal period . Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time . In recent years , ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration . We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery . METHODS : In a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled study trail , healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg diluted to 5 ml with 0.9 % saline ) or placebo ( 5 ml of 0.9 % saline ) within 5 min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord . The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms , which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS , a threshold of 9/10 was used ) at 1 week , 2 weeks , and 1 month after delivery . The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale ( NRS ) score of pain at 2 days postpartum . This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry , number ChiCTR1900022464 . RESULTS : Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019 , 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated : 165 ( 50 % ) to the ketamine group and 165 ( 50 % ) to the placebo group . There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1 week postpartum ( 13.1 % vs. 22.6 % , respectively ; p = .029 ) . However , no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2 weeks ( 11.8 % vs. 16.8 % , respectively ; p = .209 ) and 1 month postpartum ( 10.5 % vs. 14.2 % , respectively ; p = .319 ) . The NRS score of wound pain ( 3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.0 ± 1.0 , respectively ; p < .001 ) and uterine contraction pain ( 3.0 ± 0.9 vs. 4.1 ± 0.9 , respectively ; p < .001 ) was lower in the ketamine group at 2 days postpartum compared with placebo group . The prevalence of headache , hallucination , and dizziness was higher in the ketamine group than the placebo group during the operation . CONCLUSIONS : Operative intravenous ketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg ) can reduce the postpartum depressive symptoms for 1 week . The long - time effect is remained to be seen ."

 BACKGROUND : Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function , although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . However , the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD . METHODS : A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5 - mg / kg ketamine , 0.2 - mg / kg ketamine , or normal saline infusion groups . Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion . Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go / no - go tasks at baseline , Day 3 , and Day 14 post ketamine infusion . RESULTS : A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD . The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg / kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go / no - go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion . A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5 - mg / kg ketamine infusion group .

0.5 mg / kg	8947	after patients received four ( 0.5 mg / kg ) infusions of racemic ketamine	"Anterior default mode network and posterior insular connectivity is predictive of depressive symptom reduction following serial ketamine infusion.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine is a rapidly - acting antidepressant treatment with robust response rates . Previous studies have reported that serial ketamine therapy modulates resting state functional connectivity in several large - scale networks , though it remains unknown whether variations in brain structure , function , and connectivity impact subsequent treatment success . We used a data - driven approach to determine whether pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging measures predict changes along symptom dimensions of depression following serial ketamine infusion . METHODS : Patients with depression ( n = 60 ) received structural , resting state functional , and diffusion MRI scans before treatment . Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS-17 ) , the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology ( IDS - C ) , and the Rumination Response Scale ( RRS ) before and 24 h after patients received four ( 0.5 mg / kg ) infusions of racemic ketamine over 2 weeks . Nineteen unaffected controls were assessed at similar timepoints . Random forest regression models predicted symptom changes using pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging and demographic measures . RESULTS : Two HDRS-17 subscales , the HDRS-6 and core mood and anhedonia ( CMA ) symptoms , and the RRS : reflection ( RRSR ) scale were predicted significantly with 19 , 27 , and 1 % variance explained , respectively . Increased right medial prefrontal cortex / anterior cingulate and posterior insula ( PoI ) and lower kurtosis of the superior longitudinal fasciculus predicted reduced HDRS-6 and CMA symptoms following treatment . RRSR change was predicted by global connectivity of the left posterior cingulate , left insula , and right superior parietal lobule . CONCLUSIONS : Our findings support that connectivity of the anterior default mode network and PoI may serve as potential biomarkers of antidepressant outcomes for core depressive symptoms ."

He reported discontinuing all psychotropic medications 2 months prior to entering the trial . The patient provided written consent for this case report publication in addition to the consent provided for trial participation . This case suggests that the mechanism of antidepressant action of psilocybin may be independent of 5 - HT2A receptor activation and psychedelic effects . However , a single case report must be interpreted cautiously , and prospective clinical trials are needed to determine the potential 5- HT2A – independent antidepressant effects of psilocybin , with major implications for scalability and acceptability ( PsycInfo Database Record ( c ) 2023 APA , all rights reserved )"

84 mg	1237	the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in	"A novel study design to evaluate the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder , including suicidal ideation , in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.^ 
 Background : Major depressive disorder ( MDD ) is associated with an elevated rate of mortality , primarily due to suicide . The risk of suicide in those with MDD is about 20 times that of the general population , with approximately half of all suicides occurring in depressed individuals . While conventional antidepressants are often effective in treating depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation ( SI ) , their delayed onset of action significantly limits their utility in the treatment of patients with MDD who are at imminent risk of for suicide . Recently , several studies of ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated that these agents can improve symptoms of depression in individuals with MDD within hours of administration . Additionally , preliminary studies of ketamine suggest it may have a similarly rapid effect in significantly reducing SI in subjects with MDD . As such , Janssen R&D is developing intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD , including SI , in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . The pursuit of this novel indication has required the development of an innovative study design that allows for the detection of rapid symptom change , and addresses the safety and ethical concerns of studying an acutely suicidal patient population . This poster will discuss the design and implementation of PeRSEVERe ( ESKETINSUI2001 ) , an ongoing proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Methods : PeRSEVERe is an ongoing 12‐week , randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled , multicenter Phase 2 study of intranasal esketamine in 70 adult subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Eligible subjects must have active suicidal ideation and intent , and be in need of psychiatric hospitalization . The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in reducing the symptoms of MDD , including SI , in subjects who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide , as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 4 hours post‐dose on Day 1 . Secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of single and repeated doses of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo on the clinician 's assessment of suicide risk as measured by the Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool , and the subject 's report of the severity in suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation , through the end of the double‐blind treatment and follow‐up phases . Additionally , the study evaluates response rates ( ≥ 50 % reduction in MADRS total score from baseline , with onset by Day 1 sustained through the end of the double‐blind treatment phase ) across treatment groups . Safety objectives include the assessment of dissociative and psychosis‐like symptoms , sedation , nasal tolerability , vital signs and suicidal thinking and behavior . The study consists of a 24‐48 hour screening evaluation performed prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose , immediately followed by a 25‐day double blind treatment phase , and a 56‐day follow up phase . Given the vulnerability of the patient population , the study is being conducted in the context of standard clinical care , with all subjects receiving standard antidepressant medication and initial in‐patient hospitalization . Results : PeRSEVERe is the first large‐scale , prospective , placebo‐controlled trial of a rapidly acting antidepressant in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . The study is being conducted in the United States and is currently ongoing , with over 70 % of subjects enrolled . Details and rationale for the study design , outcome measures , and key efficacy times points will be discussed . Additionally , key operational insights and challenges unique to the study of a rapidly acting antidepressant in a suicidal patient population will e highlighted . Conclusions : PeRSERVERe employs innovative clinical trial methodology in a Phase 2 study for a novel indication , in a vulnerable patient population‐i.e . the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD , including SI , in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide . Should this approach prove successful in Phase 2 , similar methods will be considered in the design of subsequent pivotal trials of esketamine , and possibly other rapidly acting antidepressants . Results of PeRSERVERe are expected to be available in 2016 ."
50 μg	9151	with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD	"LSD , afterglow and hangover : Increased episodic memory and verbal fluency , decreased cognitive flexibility.^ 
 Psychedelics acutely impair cognitive functions , but these impairments decline with growing experiences with psychedelics and microdoses may even exert opposing effects . Given the recent evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity , this explorative study aimed at investigating the potential of psychedelics to sub - acutely change cognition . For this , we applied a randomized , double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover study with 24 healthy volunteers receiving 50 μg lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) or an inactive placebo . Sub - acute changes in cognition were measured 24 h after dosing , including memory ( Rey - Osterrieth Complex Figure , ROCF ; 2D Object - Location Memory Task , OLMT ; Rey Auditory - Verbal Learning Test , RAVLT ) , verbal fluency ( phonological ; semantic ; switch ) , design fluency ( basic ; filter ; switch ) , cognitive flexibility ( Wisconsin Card Sorting Test , WCST ) , sustained and switching attention ( Trail Making Test , TMT ) , inhibitory control ( Stroop Task ) and perceptual reasoning ( Block Design Test , BDT ) . The results show that when compared to placebo and corrected for Body Mass Index ( BMI ) and abstinence period from psychedelics , LSD sub - acutely improved visuospatial memory ( ROCF immediate recall points and percentage , OLMT consolidation percentage ) and phonological verbal fluency and impaired cognitive flexibility ( WCST : fewer categories achieved ; more perseveration , errors and conceptual level responses ) . In conclusion , the low dose of LSD moderately induced both "" afterglow "" and "" hangover "" . The improvements in visuospatial memory and phonological fluency suggest that LSD - assisted therapy should be explored as a novel treatment perspective in conditions involving memory and language declines such as brain injury , stroke or dementia ."
0.5 mg / kg	6366	received a single subanesthetic ( 0.5 mg / kg ) ketamine infusion . Dissociative	"Features of dissociation differentially predict antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment - resistant depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine induces rapid and robust antidepressant effects , and many patients also describe dissociation , which is associated with antidepressant response . This follow - up study investigated whether antidepressant efficacy is uniquely related to dissociative symptom clusters . METHODS : Treatment - resistant patients with major depressive disorder ( MDD ) or bipolar disorder ( BD ) ( n = 126 ) drawn from three studies received a single subanesthetic ( 0.5 mg / kg ) ketamine infusion . Dissociative effects were measured using the Clinician - Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) . Antidepressant response was measured using the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HAM - D ) . A confirmatory factor analysis established the validity of CADSS subscales ( derealization , depersonalization , amnesia ) , and a general linear model with repeated measures was fitted to test whether subscale scores were associated with antidepressant response . RESULTS : Factor validity was supported , with a root mean square error of approximation of .06 , a comparative fit index of .97 , and a Tucker - Lewis index of .96 . Across all studies and timepoints , the depersonalization subscale was positively related to HAM - D percent change . A significant effect of derealization on HAM - D percent change was observed at one timepoint ( Day 7 ) in one study . The amnesia subscale was unrelated to HAM - D percent change . LIMITATIONS : Possible inadequate blinding ; combined MDD / BD datasets might have underrepresented ketamine 's antidepressant efficacy ; the possibility of Type I errors in secondary analyses . CONCLUSIONS : From a psychometric perspective , researchers may elect to administer only the CADSS depersonalization subscale , given that it was most closely related to antidepressant response . From a neurobiological perspective , mechanistic similarities may exist between ketamine - induced depersonalization and antidepressant response , although off - target effects can not be excluded ."

 RATIONALE : ±3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is widely believed to increase sociability . The drug alters speech production and fluency , and may influence speech content . Here , we investigated the effect of MDMA on speech content , which may reveal how this drug affects social interactions . METHOD : Thirty - five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two - session , within - subjects , double - blind study during which they received 1.5 mg / kg oral MDMA and placebo . Participants completed a five - minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship ( e.g. a friend or family member ) with a research assistant . The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories ( e.g. words pertaining to affect , social interaction , and cognition ) , using both a standard dictionary method ( Pennebaker 's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count : LIWC ) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers . RESULTS : Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo . Using LIWC scores , the drug increased use of social and sexual words , consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose . Using the machine learning algorithm , we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions . CONCLUSIONS : These findings are consistent with reports that MDMA acutely alters speech content , specifically increasing emotional and social content during a brief semistructured dyadic interaction . Studying effects of psychoactive drugs on speech content may offer new insights into drug effects on mental states , and on emotional and psychosocial interaction ."

 There is growing interest in the therapeutic utility of psychedelic substances , like psilocybin , for disorders characterized by distortions of the self - experience , like depression . Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior ; however this has never been tested in humans . Following a double - blind , placebo - controlled , parallel group design , we utilized an ultra - high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin ( 0.17 mg / kg ) induced region - dependent alterations in glutamate , which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one 's self ( ego dissolution ) . Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution , lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution . Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic , as well as the baseline , state . Importantly , they may also provide a neurochemical basis for therapeutic effects as witnessed in ongoing clinical trials ."

 Tested the hypothesis that a sub - anaesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) antagonist , ketamine , would induce psychophysiological and selective attention anomalies in healthy Ss that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients . In a double - blind randomized placebo - controlled design , 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg / kg ketamine . Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard ( 80 % ) and deviant tones ( 20 % ) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear . Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms . The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear . Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss , but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude ( both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular ) , enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli , and did not effect mismatch negativity .

 BACKGROUND : Several early phase studies have demonstrated that psilocybin - assisted therapy has rapid - acting and persisting antidepressant effects from just one or two doses . However , methodological limitations ( e.g. , placebo - control , blinding ) limit interpretability of the existing literature . METHODS : In an exploratory placebo - controlled , within - subject , fixed - order study , individuals with moderate to severe major depressive disorder were administered placebo ( n = 19 ) followed by psilocybin ( 0.3 mg / kg ) ( n = 15 ) 4 weeks later . Dosing sessions were embedded within an manualized course of psychotherapy . Enhanced blinding procedures were used . Depression , anxiety , and quality of life were measured over a 16 - week study period . RESULTS : Depression and anxiety significantly improved following both placebo and psilocybin with no significant difference in the degree of change between the two conditions . However , antidepressant effect sizes were larger after psilocybin ( d ' = 1.02 - 2.27 ) than after placebo ( d ' = 0.65 - 0.99 ) and there were high rates of response ( 66.7 % ) and remission ( 46.7 % ) following psilocybin administration . Antidepressant effects following psilocybin persisted , on average , for 2 months and there were persisting improvements in mood - related quality of life domains . The strength of mystical - type experience during psilocybin dosing was not correlated with subsequent antidepressant effects . CONCLUSIONS : The results of this exploratory study highlight the complex interplay between expectancy , therapy effects , and drug / placebo effects in psychedelic - assisted psychotherapy studies . Nonetheless , the acute and persisting clinical improvements observed following psilocybin support further study of its potential in the treatment of major depression . Future studies should more explicitly mitigate and measure expectancy effects and assess the impact of repeated dosing and different forms of psychotherapeutic support ."

 Background : Currently , electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is used as an effective treatment method in many psychiatric disorders . The basis of a successful electroshock session is to create a seizure with the precise intensity , quality and duration . In addition to the appropriate method of shock induction , appropriate anesthesia methods should be used to cause such seizures . The present study compared a combination of low - dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine ( Ketodex ) with a combination of low - dose ketamine and midazolam ( Ketomid ) on hemodynamic changes in electroshocks applied to patients referred from the psychiatric ward . Methodology : This study was a randomized triple - blind clinical trial performed after obtaining permission from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences . For this purpose , 70 patients were selected for electroshock therapy and randomly distributed into two groups of 35 people . In the first group , 0.04 mg / kg midazolam was combined with ketamine 0.1 mg / kg and in the second group , 0.5 μg / kg dexmedetomidine with 0.1 mg / kg ketamine . The patients were placed under complete cardiovascular monitoring . Hemodynamic changes of patients were measured and recorded before injection , after injection , after shock , and at 5 and 10 min after the end of seizures . Results : In this study , 70 patients who were candidates for receiving ECT were equally divided into two groups of 35 : one group received a mixture of Ketodex and the second group a combination of Ketomid . The two study groups showed no significant difference in terms of systolic pressure ( P = 0.883 ) , diastolic ( P = 0.443 ) , mean arterial pressure ( P = 0.443 ) , oxygen saturation ( P = 0.018 ) , and heart rate ( P = 0.286 ) . Complications such as headache , muscular pain ( P = 0.01 ) , bradycardia , nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups . Conclusion : Our study showed that although systolic , diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure , heart rate and oxygen saturation were significantly reduced in both study groups , no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of hemodynamic changes and neither drug group in our study population was different from the other in terms of these parameters . In addition , neither option was superior to the other . However , due to the fact that complications such as headache , muscular pain , bradycardia , nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups , the combination of midazolam and ketamine appeared to be a more appropriate combination in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy ."

100 mg	6677	mephedrone 200 mg , MDMA 100 mg , and placebo . Outcome	"Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^ 
 Mephedrone ( 4 - methylmethcathinone ) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA ( 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine , ecstasy ) . Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications . At present , there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration . This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA . Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized , double - blind , crossover , and placebo - controlled trial . The single oral dose conditions were : mephedrone 200 mg , MDMA 100 mg , and placebo . Outcome variables included physiological , subjective , and psychomotor effects , and pharmacokinetic parameters . The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov ( NCT02232789 ) . Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , and pupillary diameter . It elicited stimulant - like effects , euphoria , and well - being , and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration . Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h , respectively . The elimination half - life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA . In a similar manner to MDMA , mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability . Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects , probably related to its short elimination half - life , could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users ."

There is a paucity of literature comparing subanesthetic intravenous ( IV ) ketamine and US Food and Drug Administration ( FDA)-approved intranasal ( IN ) esketamine for TRD in real - world clinical settings . We compared the efficacy and time to achieve remission / response with repeated ketamine and esketamine . Methods : An observational study of adults with TRD received up to 6 IV ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) or up to 8 IN esketamine ( 56- or 84 - mg ) treatments from August 17 , 2017 , to June 24 , 2021 . Depressive symptoms were measured utilizing the 16 - item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self - report ( QIDS - SR ) before and 24 hours after treatment . Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between time to response ( ≥ 50 % change in QIDS - SR score ) and remission ( QIDS - SR score ≤ 5 ) . Results : Sixty - two adults ( median age = 50 years , 65 % female ) received IV ketamine ( 76 % , n = 47 ) or IN esketamine ( 24 % , n = 15 ) . Neither baseline - to - endpoint change in QIDS - SR score nor response / remission rates were significantly different between groups . Time to remission , defined as number of treatments ( adjusting for age , body mass index [ BMI ] , sex , and baseline QIDS - SR score ) , was faster for IV versus IN treatment ( HR = 5.0 , P = .02 ) . Conclusions : Intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine showed similar rates of response and remission in TRD patients , but the number of treatments required to achieve remission was significantly lower with IV ketamine compared to IN esketamine .

Brain electromagnetic activity imaging of the responses to sound stimuli has been carried out by way of a 148 - channel magnetoencephalography - system . Actual evoked response amplitudes and underlying equivalent current dipole strengths have been compared to multi - electrode evoked potentials from the scalp . A click stimulus is capable to inhibit test responses under placebo at the 100 ms interval . During maintenance infusion of ketamine at steady - state ( for > 30 min ) after 0.27 mg / kg , no such amplitude changes were observed anymore ( p < 0.05 ) and under these circumstances significant increases in Brief Psychiatric Rating scale and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores were evidenced ( p < 0.001 ) . Intermediate effects have been observed when the dose was lowered to 0.081 mg / kg . The present results have shown that ketamine may induce a psychotic - like clinical state associated with gating deficits in healthy subjects ."

 RATIONALE : Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus . This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers . OBJECTIVE : In this study , we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser , MDMA , on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers . In particular , we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies . METHODS : Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week , with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA ( 1.7 , 5.4 and 17.0 mg / kg ) . On each test day , rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later , 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA . For the human study , a placebo - controlled within - subject design and double - blind procedures were used . Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration ( order being counterbalanced ) . On each test day , subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures . Ninety minutes later , subjects received placebo or MDMA ( 1.7 mg / kg PO ) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA . RESULTS : As expected , MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose - related fashion in rats . In contrast , a typical recreational dose of MDMA ( 1.7 mg / kg , orally ) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects . CONCLUSIONS : This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species - specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect , or both ."

 3 , 4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , "" Ecstasy "" ) is a recreational drug reported to produce a different psychological profile than that of classic hallucinogens and stimulants . It has , therefore , been tentatively classified into a novel pharmacological class termed entactogens . This double - blind placebo - controlled study examined the effects of a typical recreational dose of MDMA ( 1.7 mg / kg ) in 13 MDMA - naïve healthy volunteers . MDMA produced an effective state of enhanced mood , well - being , and increased emotional sensitiveness , little anxiety , but no hallucinations or panic reactions . Mild depersonalization and derealization phenomena occurred together with moderate thought disorder , first signs of loss of body control , and alterations in the meaning of percepts . Subjects also displayed changes in the sense of space and time , heightened sensory awareness , and increased psychomotor drive . MDMA did not impair selective attention as measured by the Stroop test . MDMA increased blood pressure moderately , with the exception of one subject who showed a transient hypertensive reaction . This severe increase in blood pressure indicates that the hypertensive effects of MDMA , even at recreational doses , should not be underestimated , particularly in subjects with latent cardiovascular problems . Most frequent acute somatic complaints during the MDMA challenge were jaw clenching , lack of appetite , impaired gait , and restless legs . Adverse sequelae during the following 24 hours included lack of energy and appetite , feelings of restlessness , insomnia , jaw clenching , occasional difficulty concentrating , and brooding . The present findings are consistent with the hypothesis that MDMA produces a different psychological profile than classic hallucinogens or psychostimulants ."

 Background : Psilocybin - assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated significant promise as a treatment for depression , anxiety , and existential distress associated with serious medical illness and has generally been employed on an individual basis , which presents challenges for scaling and resource availability . There are also compelling theoretical reasons to suggest that group - based formats - if utilized in a thoughtful fashion - might offer unique or enhanced therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or populations . The HOPE trial is an IRB - approved open - label feasibility and safety pilot study of psi - locybin enhanced group therapy in patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder associated with a cancer diagnosis completed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute ( HCI ) in Salt Lake City , Utah ( HOPE : A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer ) . We report here quali - tative survey - based data , impressions , and suggestions for group - based psychedelic - assisted therapy interventions based on our observations to inform future studies . Methods : Patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder with an underlying cancer diagnosis were recruited from HCI by referral from oncology providers , palliative care , and social work . Following screening and consenting , 4 - 6 partici - pants per cohort ( with three total cohorts ) were enrolled in a protocol involving 3 120 min group preparatory sessions , a single high - dose ( 25 mg ) group psilocybin session , and 3 subsequent group integration sessions . Primary clinical outcomes are still in process of data collection and analysis . Qualitative data was gathered from patient written reports and a survey administered at 2 weeks post intervention . Qualitative reports were also gathered from the therapist team at a post - study group process session . Findings : We report here results from a qualitative survey of participant experiences with group format study design , as well as impressions and guidelines for group format and group psychotherapeutic process to inform other studies pursuing group - based interventions in psychedelic therapy . Suggestions are provided for protocol design , screening processes , space considerations , therapist team structure , group process , music , timeline , as well as potential issues and challenges ."

 BACKGROUND When administered as a continuous infusion , ketamine is known to be a potent analgesic and general anaesthetic . Recent studies suggest that a single low‐dose administration of ketamine can provide a long‐lasting effect on mood , but its effects when given in the postoperative period have not been studied . OBJECTIVE We hypothesised that a single low‐dose administration of ketamine after bariatric surgery can improve pain and mood scores in the immediate postoperative period . DESIGN We performed a randomised , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study to compare a single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine ( 0.4 mg kg‐1 ) with a normal saline placebo in the postanaesthesia care unit after laparoscopic gastric bypass and gastrectomy . SETTING Single‐centre , tertiary care hospital , October 2014 to January 2018 . PATIENTS A total of 100 patients were randomised into the ketamine and saline groups . INTERVENTION Patients in the ketamine group received a single dose of ketamine infusion ( 0.4 mg kg‐1 ) in the postanaesthesia care unit . Patients in the placebo groups received 0.9 % saline . OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was the visual analogue pain score . A secondary outcome was performance on the short‐form McGill ’s Pain Questionnaire ( SF‐MPQ ) . RESULTS There were no significant differences in visual analogue pain scores between groups ( group‐by‐time interaction P ¼ 0.966 ; marginal group effect P ¼ 0.137 ) . However , scores on the affective scale of SF‐MPQ ( secondary outcome ) significantly decreased in the ketamine group as early as postoperative day ( POD ) 2 [ mean difference ¼ ‐2.2 ( 95 % bootstrap CI ‐2.9 to 1.6 ) , Bonferroni adjusted P < 0.001 ] , compared with placebo group in which the scores decreased only by POD 7 . Scores on the total scale of SF‐MPQ for the ketamine group were smaller compared with the placebo group ( P ¼ 0.034 ) . CONCLUSION Although there was no significant difference between ketamine and placebo for the primary outcome measure , patients who received ketamine experienced statistically and clinically significant improvement in their comprehensive evaluation of pain , particularly the affective component of pain , on POD 2 . However , future studies are needed to confirm the enduring effects of ketamine on the affective response to postoperative pain ."

75 mg	4634	. Treatments are MDMA ( 75 mg , oral ) alone ,	"MDMA , oxytocin and empathy : preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^ 
 Objective : Background . The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour ( PSB ) is yet not known . Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin ( 5‐HT ) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood , empathy and social interaction . Moreover , MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin . The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects . Methods : Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study ( currently N=5 ) . Treatments are MDMA ( 75 mg , oral ) alone , and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist ( pindolol , 20 mg , oral ) , Oxytocin ( 48 IU , intranasal ) , and placebo . Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks ( Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test ) and a questionnaire ( Profile of Mood States ) . It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects . Results : Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment . Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the ' vigor ' scale ( Figure presented ) ( p=0.032 ) and a trend on the ' arousal ' and ' elation ' scale . These ' stimulant ' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin . Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects ( also of MDMA ) on more scales . Conclusion : The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have ' stimulant ' effects on different mood states . Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB ."

 In Western societies a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to the combination of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA or ' ecstasy ' ) and cannabis . The aim of the present study was to assess the acute effects of co - administration of MDMA and THC ( the main psychoactive compound of cannabis ) on pharmacokinetics , psychomotor performance , memory and subjective experience over time . We performed a four - way , double blind , randomized , crossover , placebo - controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers ( 12 male , four female ) between the ages of 18 and 27 . MDMA ( 100 mg ) was given orally , THC ( 4 , 6 , and 6 mg , interval of 90 min ) was vaporized and inhaled . THC induced more robust cognitive impairment compared with MDMA , and co - administration did not exacerbate single drug effects on cognitive function . However , co - administration of THC with MDMA increased desired subjective drug effects and drug strength compared with the MDMA condition , which may explain the widespread use of this combination ."

 Background : Growing evidence suggests psilocybin , a naturally occurring psychedelic , is a safe and promising pharmacotherapy for treatment of mood and substance use disorders when administered as part of a structured intervention . In most trials to date , psilocybin dose has been administered on a weight - adjusted basis rather than the more convenient procedure of administering a fixed dose . Aims : The present post hoc analyses sought to determine whether the subjective effects of psilocybin are affected by body weight when psilocybin is administered on a weight - adjusted basis and when psilocybin is administered as a fixed dose . Methods : We analyzed acute subjective drug effects ( mystical , challenging , and intensity ) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies ( total N = 288 ) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg ( inclusive ) . Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg ( n = 120 ) , participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg ( n = 182 ) , and participants whose weight - adjusted dose was about 25 mg ( to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder ) ( n = 103 ) . Results : In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight - adjusted groups , and in the fixed dose group , no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex . Across a wide range of body weights ( 49 to 113 kg ) the present results showed no evidence that body weight affected subjective effects of psilocybin . Conclusions : These results suggest that the convenience and lower cost of administering psilocybin as a fixed dose outweigh any potential advantage of weight - adjusted dosing ."

 Background : Growing evidence suggests psilocybin , a naturally occurring psychedelic , is a safe and promising pharmacotherapy for treatment of mood and substance use disorders when administered as part of a structured intervention . In most trials to date , psilocybin dose has been administered on a weight - adjusted basis rather than the more convenient procedure of administering a fixed dose . Aims : The present post hoc analyses sought to determine whether the subjective effects of psilocybin are affected by body weight when psilocybin is administered on a weight - adjusted basis and when psilocybin is administered as a fixed dose . Methods : We analyzed acute subjective drug effects ( mystical , challenging , and intensity ) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies ( total N = 288 ) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg ( inclusive ) . Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg ( n = 120 ) , participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg ( n = 182 ) , and participants whose weight - adjusted dose was about 25 mg ( to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder ) ( n = 103 ) . Results : In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight - adjusted groups , and in the fixed dose group , no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex .

100 mg	2820	course of eight treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam	"Repeated intranasal ketamine for treatment - resistant depression - the way to go ? Results from a pilot randomised controlled trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine research in depression has mostly used intravenous , weight - based approaches , which are difficult to translate clinically . Intranasal ( IN ) ketamine is a promising alternative but no controlled data has been published on the feasibility , safety and potential efficacy of repeated IN ketamine treatments . METHODS : This randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled pilot study compared a 4 - week course of eight treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam . Each treatment was given as 10 separate IN sprays , self - administered 5 min apart . The study was stopped early due to poor tolerability after five treatment - resistant depressed participants were included . Feasibility , safety ( acute and cumulative ) , cognitive and efficacy outcomes were assessed . Plasma ketamine and norketamine concentrations were assayed after the first treatment . RESULTS : Significant acute cardiovascular , psychotomimetic and neurological side effects occurred at doses < 100 mg ketamine . No participants were able to self - administer all 10 ketamine sprays due to incoordination ; treatment time occasionally had to be extended ( > 45 min ) due to acute side effects . No hepatic , cognitive or urinary changes were observed after the treatment course in either group . There was an approximately two - fold variation in ketamine and norketamine plasma concentrations between ketamine participants . At course end , one participant had remitted in each of the ketamine and midazolam groups . CONCLUSIONS : IN ketamine , with the drug formulation and delivery device used , was not a useful treatment approach in this study . Absorption was variable between individuals and acute tolerability was poor , requiring prolonged treatment administration time in some individuals . The drug formulation , the delivery device , the insufflation technique and individual patient factors play an important role in tolerability and efficacy when using IN ketamine for TRD ."

 MDMA is a psychoactive substance that primarily enhances serotonergic neurotransmission by releasing 5‐HT through the SERT . It also releases dopamine and norepinephrine , although less potently , through the dopamine transporter and norepinephrine transporter , respectively . In addition to its use as a recreational drug , MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy has been investigated in several phase 2 trials and one phase 3 trial for PTSD . Further indications for MDMA‐assisted therapy being planned or ongoing are eating disorders , social anxiety , and alcohol use disorder . The present study focuses on dosing aspects of MDMA used in clinical studies and recreational settings , specifically the benefits of a second administration ( booster dose ) given several hours after the initial dose . Most published studies of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy used a booster dose . A typical dosing regimen would be 80‐120 mg of MDMA initially followed by half the initial dose after 1.5‐2.5 hours . Although previous studies have found that a booster dose could prolong the acute effects of MDMA , others have shown an acute tolerance reflected in the finding that acute subjective effects return to baseline within 4‐5 hours , while plasma concentrations are still close to peak levels . These findings have led to controversy regarding how effective a booster dose would be in prolonging acute effects , as it has never been directly compared to placebo . Additionally , the higher total dose could lead to an increase in side effects . Therefore , the present phase 1 study intends to compare the acute subjective , physiological , and endocrine effects of MDMA ( 120 mg + 60 mg after 2 hours ) , MDMA ( 120 mg + placebo after 2 hours ) , and ( placebo + placebo after 2 hours ) using a double‐blind , random‐order , crossover design in healthy subjects ."

0.71 mg / kg	1806	intravenous administration of ketamine ( 0.71 mg / kg , N=17 ) or the	"A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder : A Randomized Midazolam - Controlled Pilot Trial.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness , and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable . In this pilot study , the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes . METHODS : Participants were randomly assigned to a 52 - minute intravenous administration of ketamine ( 0.71 mg / kg , N=17 ) or the active control midazolam ( 0.025 mg / kg , N=23 ) , provided during the second week of a 5 - week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy . Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method , with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing . A longitudinal logistic mixed - effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion . RESULTS : Participants ( N=40 ) were mostly middle - aged ( mean age=53 years [ SD=9.8 ] ) , predominantly white ( 70.3 % ) , and largely employed ( 71.8 % ) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study . Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence , delayed the time to relapse , and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam . Infusions were well tolerated , with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events . CONCLUSIONS : A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy . These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy - behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder . Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample ."

 Sleep disturbances ( SDs ) are among the most distressing and commonly reported symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . Despite increased attention on sleep in clinical PTSD research , SDs remain difficult to treat . In Phase 2 trials , 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to greatly improve PTSD symptoms . We hypothesized that MDMA - assisted psychotherapy would improve self - reported sleep quality ( SQ ) in individuals with PTSD and be associated with declining PTSD symptoms . Participants in four studies ( n = 63 ) were randomized to receive 2 - 3 sessions of active MDMA ( 75 - 125 mg ; n = 47 ) or placebo / control MDMA ( 0 - 40 mg , n = 16 ) during all - day psychotherapy sessions . The PSQI was used to assess change in SQ from baseline to the primary endpoint , 1 - 2 months after the blinded sessions . Additionally , PSQI scores were measured at treatment exit ( TE ) and 12 - month follow - up . Symptoms of PTSD were measured using the CAPS - IV . At the primary endpoint , CAPS - IV total severity scores dropped more after active MDMA than after placebo / control ( -34.0 vs. -12.4 ) , p = .003 . Participants in the active dose group showed more improvement in SQ compared to those in the control group ( PSQI total score ΔM = -3.5 vs. 0.6 ) , p = .003 .

0.75 mg / kg	1537	use of IM ketamine ( 0.75 mg / kg ) vs. active control (	"Intramuscular ketamine vs. escitalopram and aripiprazole in acute and maintenance treatment of patients with treatment - resistant depression : a randomized double - blind clinical trial.^ 
 Objective : Ketamine , an N‐methyl D‐aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist , can promote rapid action in the management of individuals with treatment‐resistant depression ( TRD ) at sub‐anesthetic doses . However , few studies have investigated the long‐term use of ketamine administered intravenously ( IV ) and intranasally ( IN ) . We report the design and rationale of a therapeutic trial for assessing the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of repeated‐dose intramuscular ( IM ) ketamine vs. active treatment ( escitalopram and aripiprazole ) in TRD patients . Methods : A comparative , parallel‐group , randomized double‐blind trial assessing the efficacy , safety , and tolerability of acute ( 4 weeks ) and maintenance ( 24 weeks ) use of IM ketamine ( 0.75 mg / kg ) vs. active control ( escitalopram 15 mg and aripiprazole 5 mg ) in individuals with moderate‐severe intensity TRD ( no psychotic symptoms ) with or without suicide risk will be conducted . Patients with TRD ( 18–40 years ) will be randomized and blinded to receive ketamine IM or active treatment at a 1:1 ratio for 4 weeks ( active treatment ) and 24 weeks ( maintenance treatment ) . Subjects will be assessed using clinical scales , monitored for vital signs ( VS ) after application of injectable medication , and undergo neuropsychological tests . The primary outcome will be changed on the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) during the course of the trial . The study is in running . Results : This study can potentially yield evidence on the use of IM ketamine in the treatment of depressive disorders as an ultra‐rapid low‐cost therapy associated with less patient discomfort and reduced use of medical resources , and can elucidate long‐term effects on different outcomes , such as neuropsychological aspects . Conclusions : The trial can help promote the introduction of a novel accessible approach for the treatment of complex disease ( TRD ) and also allow refinement of its long‐term use .

2 mg / kg	5723	group C ) , plus 2 mg / kg ketamine ( group K )	"Effect of local wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress after abdominal hysterectomy , a randomized trial.^ 
 Background and Objectives : Postoperative pain and stress elicit hormonal changes . We aimed at comparing the effects of wound infiltration with ketamine versus dexmedetomidine on postoperative pain and stress response . Methods : This double‐blinded study included ninety patients scheduled for total abdominal hysterectomy and were randomly assigned into three groups to receive local wound infiltration with 40 mL of 0.25 % bupivacaine ( group C ) , plus 2 mg / kg ketamine ( group K ) or 2 μg / kg dexmedetomidine ( group D ) . Primary outcome was postoperative morphine consumption ; secondary outcomes included first request of analgesia , VAS scores at rest and movement ( VAS – R / M ) and side effects . Serum cortisol , prolactin and glucose levels at baseline , pre‐infiltration , 6 and 24 h postoperatively were measured . Results : Rescue analgesia was less in K ( 6.80 ± 3.19 mg ) and D ( 8.39 ± 3.86 mg ) compared to C ( 13.33 ± 4.01 mg ) ( p < 0.05 ) . First request of analgesia was delayed in K ( 7.60 ± 4.16 h ) and D ( 6.00 ± 3.73 h ) compared to C ( 4.20 ± 1.13 h ) ( p < 0.05 ) . Both VAS and R / M were significantly lower in K ( all over 24 h ) and D ( for 8 and 4 h , respectively ) compared to C. Stress markers were significantly lower in K and D compared to C at 6 and 24 h , and in K compared to D at 24 h ( p < 0.05 ) . Conclusions : Local wound infiltration with ketamine or dexmedetomidine added to bupivacaine had an opioid‐sparing effect , delayed first request of rescue analgesia , and attenuated postoperative stress response , especially with ketamine in patients underwent total abdominal hysterectomy .

 BACKGROUND : Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders , many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments . This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population . METHODS : We did a randomised , double - blind , dose - response , phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA . We included service personnel who were 18 years or older , with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more , and who had a Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS - IV ) total score of 50 or greater . Using a web - based randomisation system , we randomly assigned participants ( 1:1:2 ) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy : 30 mg ( active control ) , 75 mg , or 125 mg . We masked investigators , independent outcome raters , and participants until after the primary endpoint . MDMA was administered orally in two 8 - h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy . The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS - IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session . Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100 - 125 mg MDMA - assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open - label crossover , and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session . Safety was monitored through adverse events , spontaneously reported expected reactions , vital signs , and suicidal ideation and behaviour . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01211405 . FINDINGS : Between Nov 10 , 2010 , and Jan 29 , 2015 , 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg ( n=7 ) , 75 mg ( n=7 ) , or 125 mg ( n=12 ) of MDMA plus psychotherapy . At the primary endpoint , the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity ( mean change CAPS - IV total scores of -58·3 [ SD 9·8 ] and -44·3 [ 28·7 ] ; p=0·001 ) than the 30 mg group ( -11·4 [ 12·7 ] ) . Compared with the 30 mg group , Cohen 's d effect sizes were large : 2·8 ( 95 % CI 1·19 - 4·39 ) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 ( 0·04 - 2·08 ) for the 125 mg group . In the open - label crossover with full - dose MDMA ( 100 - 125 mg ) , PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg ( p=0·01 ) , whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment ( p=0·81 ) . PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12 - month follow - up compared with baseline after all groups had full - dose MDMA ( mean CAPS - IV total score of 38·8 [ SD 28·1 ] vs 87·1 [ 16·1 ] ; p<0·0001 ) . 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants . Of these adverse events , four ( 5 % ) were serious : three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment . INTERPRETATION : Active doses ( 75 mg and 125 mg ) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders .

In the open - label crossover with full - dose MDMA ( 100 - 125 mg ) , PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg ( p=0·01 ) , whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment ( p=0·81 ) .

 BACKGROUND : Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders , many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments . This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population . METHODS : We did a randomised , double - blind , dose - response , phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA . We included service personnel who were 18 years or older , with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more , and who had a Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS - IV ) total score of 50 or greater . Using a web - based randomisation system , we randomly assigned participants ( 1:1:2 ) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy : 30 mg ( active control ) , 75 mg , or 125 mg . We masked investigators , independent outcome raters , and participants until after the primary endpoint . MDMA was administered orally in two 8 - h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy . The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS - IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session . Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100 - 125 mg MDMA - assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open - label crossover , and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session .

 BACKGROUND : Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders , many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments . This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population . METHODS : We did a randomised , double - blind , dose - response , phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA . We included service personnel who were 18 years or older , with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more , and who had a Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS - IV ) total score of 50 or greater . Using a web - based randomisation system , we randomly assigned participants ( 1:1:2 ) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy : 30 mg ( active control ) , 75 mg , or 125 mg . We masked investigators , independent outcome raters , and participants until after the primary endpoint . MDMA was administered orally in two 8 - h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy . The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS - IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session . Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100 - 125 mg MDMA - assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open - label crossover , and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session . Safety was monitored through adverse events , spontaneously reported expected reactions , vital signs , and suicidal ideation and behaviour . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01211405 . FINDINGS : Between Nov 10 , 2010 , and Jan 29 , 2015 , 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg ( n=7 ) , 75 mg ( n=7 ) , or 125 mg ( n=12 ) of MDMA plus psychotherapy . At the primary endpoint , the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity ( mean change CAPS - IV total scores of -58·3 [ SD 9·8 ] and -44·3 [ 28·7 ] ; p=0·001 ) than the 30 mg group ( -11·4 [ 12·7 ] ) .

 BACKGROUND : Post - traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) is prevalent in military personnel and first responders , many of whom do not respond to currently available treatments . This study aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treating chronic PTSD in this population . METHODS : We did a randomised , double - blind , dose - response , phase 2 trial at an outpatient psychiatric clinic in the USA . We included service personnel who were 18 years or older , with chronic PTSD duration of 6 months or more , and who had a Clinician - Administered PTSD Scale ( CAPS - IV ) total score of 50 or greater . Using a web - based randomisation system , we randomly assigned participants ( 1:1:2 ) to three different dose groups of MDMA plus psychotherapy : 30 mg ( active control ) , 75 mg , or 125 mg . We masked investigators , independent outcome raters , and participants until after the primary endpoint . MDMA was administered orally in two 8 - h sessions with concomitant manualised psychotherapy . The primary outcome was mean change in CAPS - IV total score from baseline to 1 month after the second experimental session . Participants in the 30 mg and 75 mg groups subsequently underwent three 100 - 125 mg MDMA - assisted psychotherapy sessions in an open - label crossover , and all participants were assessed 12 months after the last MDMA session . Safety was monitored through adverse events , spontaneously reported expected reactions , vital signs , and suicidal ideation and behaviour . This study is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov , number NCT01211405 . FINDINGS : Between Nov 10 , 2010 , and Jan 29 , 2015 , 26 veterans and first responders met eligibility criteria and were randomly assigned to receive 30 mg ( n=7 ) , 75 mg ( n=7 ) , or 125 mg ( n=12 ) of MDMA plus psychotherapy . At the primary endpoint , the 75 mg and 125 mg groups had significantly greater decreases in PTSD symptom severity ( mean change CAPS - IV total scores of -58·3 [ SD 9·8 ] and -44·3 [ 28·7 ] ; p=0·001 ) than the 30 mg group ( -11·4 [ 12·7 ] ) . Compared with the 30 mg group , Cohen 's d effect sizes were large : 2·8 ( 95 % CI 1·19 - 4·39 ) for the 75 mg group and 1·1 ( 0·04 - 2·08 ) for the 125 mg group . In the open - label crossover with full - dose MDMA ( 100 - 125 mg ) , PTSD symptom severity significantly decreased in the group that had previously received 30 mg ( p=0·01 ) , whereas no further significant decreases were observed in the group that previously achieved a large response after 75 mg doses in the blinded segment ( p=0·81 ) . PTSD symptoms were significantly reduced at the 12 - month follow - up compared with baseline after all groups had full - dose MDMA ( mean CAPS - IV total score of 38·8 [ SD 28·1 ] vs 87·1 [ 16·1 ] ; p<0·0001 ) . 85 adverse events were reported by 20 participants . Of these adverse events , four ( 5 % ) were serious : three were deemed unrelated and one possibly related to study drug treatment . INTERPRETATION : Active doses ( 75 mg and 125 mg ) of MDMA with adjunctive psychotherapy in a controlled setting were effective and well tolerated in reducing PTSD symptoms in veterans and first responders .

 Background : Various ketamine models of schizophrenia are used for testing novel compounds . Questions remain whether electrophysiological and functional imaging outcome measures offer any advantages compared to clinical and behavioral measures in the context of drug trials . Here we tested whether a possible confounder of ketamine action , the physiological stress response , differentially affects these outcome measures . Methods : Randomized , cross‐over , placebo‐controlled pharmaimaging study in 24 male volunteers . Low‐dose S‐ketamine ( bolus prior to functional imaging : 0.1 mg / kg during 5 min , thereafter continuous infusion : 0.0156 mg / kg / min reduced by 10 % every ten minutes ) or placebo was administered while performing a visual oddball reaction time task during fMRI with simultaneous recording of event‐related potentials ( P300 ) and surrogate endpoint measures of the physiological stress response : electrodermal activity ( EDA ) and heart rate . Pre‐post imaging psychopathological status was assessed using the PANSS scale . Results : Comparable separation of drug conditions was achieved with area under the curve ( AUC ) values of 0.8‐1.0 in the clinical ( PANSS ) , behavioral ( reaction hit and false alarm rate ) , peripheral physiological ( EDA , heart rate ) , electrophyiological ( P300 ) and fMRI ( ROIs ) domains . Analysis of multivariate covariance structure revealed that clinical / behavioral but not EEG / fMRI AUC residuals are dramatically affected by stress parameters ( heart rate , EDA ) . Conclusions : Our ketamine experiment provides an instructive example how functional imaging and electrophysiology can aid the dissection of partial drug effects . These partial effects can be confounders leading to wrong decisions in the process of drug development when exclusively relying on clinical / behavioral outcome measures ."

 INTRODUCTION : The use of ketamine as an option in the treatment of depressive disorder is growing rapidly , supported by numerous clinical trials attesting its efficacy and safety . Esketamine , the S ( + ) enantiomer of ketamine , is the most widely used form in the anesthetic environment in some countries , and new studies have shown that it may also be effective in depression and with better tolerability . However , no study so far has directly compared esketamine with racemic ketamine . Here we propose a protocol of a clinical trial to evaluate esketamine as a noninferior medication when compared to ketamine in the treatment of patients with treatment - resistant depression . METHODS / DESIGN : This study protocol is for a randomized , controlled , double - blind noninferiority clinical trial . Subjects will be 18 years or older , with major depression characterized as treatment - resistant . Participants will receive a single infusion of either esketamine ( 0.25 mg / kg ) or ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) over 40 minutes . The primary outcome will be the difference in remission rates between the 2 treatment arms at 24 and 72 hours after drug infusion . Secondary outcomes will include other timepoints , measurements of cognition , dissociation , and blood biomarkers . DISCUSSION : A head - to - head study is the best way to evaluate whether the esketamine is in fact comparable to the racemic ketamine in terms of both efficacy and safety , and , if positive , it would be an initial step to increase the access to that type of treatment worldwide .

100 mg	2822	receive 8 intranasal treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam	"Increase in PAS - induced neuroplasticity after a treatment course of intranasal ketamine for depression . Report of three cases from a placebo - controlled trial.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Animal studies suggest that neural plasticity may play a role in the antidepressant effects of a single ketamine dose . However , the potential effects of repeated ketamine treatments on human neuroplasticity are unknown . METHODS : This pilot RCT study measured plasticity - induced changes before and after a ketamine course , in three treatment - resistant depressed subjects , who were randomized to receive 8 intranasal treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam . Mood ratings were performed by a trained blinded rater at baseline and 24h-48h after the ketamine course , using the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . Neuroplasticity was assessed in the motor cortex using a paired associative stimulation ( PAS ) paradigm at baseline and 24h-48h after the treatment course . No changes in current psychotropic medication or dosage were permitted for 4weeks prior to trial entry and throughout the trial . RESULTS : The subject receiving ketamine , but not those receiving midazolam , presented a marked increase in neural plasticity after the treatment course . However , mood changes were not associated with changes in neural plasticity . LIMITATIONS : Pilot study with small sample size . Concomitant antidepressant medications taken . Plasticity was tested in the motor cortex only , thus the generalizability of these findings to other brain areas can not be assumed . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that a course of intranasal ketamine may enhance synaptic plasticity in subjects with depression , but this was not associated with antidepressant effects . Further research on this topic is warranted ."

 Aims : Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) is currently investigated for several neurological and psychiatric illnesses . Various studies have investigated the pharmacokinetics and the pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationship of LSD in healthy participants , but data on urinary recovery and confirmatory studies are missing . Methods : The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics , pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 μg administered orally in 28 healthy participants . The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals ( 0–8 , 8–16 and 16–24 h after LSD administration ) . Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling . Concentration – subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic – pharmacodynamic modelling . Results : Mean ( 95 % confidence interval ) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng / mL ( 1.6–2.0 ) and 3.4 ng / mL ( 3.0–3.8 ) after the administration of 85 and 170 μg LSD , respectively . Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half - lives were 3.7 h ( 3.4–4.1 ) and 4.0 h ( 3.6–4.4 ) , for 85 and 170 μg LSD , respectively . Only 1 % of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h , 16 % was eliminated as 2 - oxo-3 - hydroxy - LSD . Urinary recovery was dose proportional . Mean ( ±standard deviation ) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 ± 3.2 and 11 ± 3.7 h , and maximal effects ( any drug effects ) were 77 ± 18 % and 87 ± 13 % after 85 and 170 μg of LSD , respectively . Conclusion : The present novel study validates previous findings .

0.2 mg / kg	7048	received Placebo or Psilocybin ( 0.2 mg / kg body weight ) . A	"Altered Prediction - Error Processing May Underlie Psilocybin - Induced Changes in Self - Processing.^ 
 Background : Psychedelic substances induce subjective alterations in our sense of body and sense of self . Despite the importance of altered bodily self‐perception in disorders such as anorexia nervosa or depression , the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood . Methods : Fifteen healthy humans participated in a randomized , placebo‐controlled , within‐subject study . Participants received Placebo or Psilocybin ( 0.2 mg / kg body weight ) . A Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task was conducted while participants underwent simultaneous EEG / fMRI scanning . FMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model . Global field power and event‐related potentials were analyzed . Results : Psilocybin reduced the BOLD signal in the Deviant > Standard contrast in the prefrontal cortex ( p<0.05 , FWE corrected ) . A significant interaction between treatment condition and stimulus type was revealed for the frontal electrode AF2 ( F(1 , 14 ) = 5.129 , p < 0.05 ) with a significant difference between Standard and Deviant in the Placebo condition , but not in the Psilocybin condition . A significant positive correlation was found between Psilocybin‐induced “ Disembodiment ” and the mean amplitude of the EEG difference wave in the Psilocybin condition ( r = 0.630 , p = 0.012 ) . Conclusions : These results show that a disruption of tactile prediction error processing in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie changes in bodily self‐perception . This seems to be driven by increased salience attribution to non‐salient stimuli under psilocybin . Together these results shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of altered bodily self‐perception and may therefore highlight important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered bodily self‐perception body perception such as anorexia nervosa and depression .

75 mg	4653	= 15 ) receiving MDMA 75 mg and placebo on two test	"Depressive mood ratings are reduced by MDMA in female polydrug ecstasy users homozygous for the l - allele of the serotonin transporter.^ 
 MDMA exerts its main effects via the serotonergic system and the serotonin transporter . The gene coding for this transporter determines the expression rate of the transporter . Previously it was shown that healthy individuals with the short allelic variant ( 's - group ' ) of the 5 - HTTLPR - polymorphism displayed more anxiety and negative mood , and had a lower transcriptional efficiency compared to individuals who are homozygous for the l - allele ( ' l - group ' ) . The present study aimed to investigate the role of the 5 - HTTLPR polymorphism in MDMA - induced mood effects . Four placebo - controlled , within - subject studies were pooled , including in total 63 polydrug ecstasy users ( N(s - group ) = 48 ; N(l - group ) = 15 ) receiving MDMA 75 mg and placebo on two test days , separated by minimally 7 days . Mood was assessed by means of the Profile of Mood States . Findings showed that MDMA induced -independent of sex- a positive mood state , and as a side effect also increased two negative affect states , anxiety and confusion . Anxiety ratings were higher in the l - group and independent of treatment or sex . Depression ratings were lowered by MDMA in the female l - group . Findings indicate that the MDMA - induced reduction in self - rated depressive feelings is sex- and genotype - dependent , with females homozygous for the l - allele showing this beneficial effect ."

The psychedelic experience was assessed with a novel Peak Experience Scale ( PES ) , the Mystical Experience Questionnaire ( MEQ ) , the Ego Dissolution Inventory ( EDI ) , the Challenging Experience Questionnaire ( CEQ ) , and the 5 - Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire ( 5D - ASC ) . Further aims were to assess the impact of 5 - MeO - DMT on cognitive functioning , mood , and well - being . Higher doses of 5 - MeO - DMT produced significant increments in the intensity of the psychedelic experience ratings as compared to the lowest 2 mg dose on all questionnaires , except the CEQ . Prominent effects were observed following single doses of 6 , 12 , and 18 mg on PES and MEQ ratings , while maximal effects on PES , MEQ , EDI , and 5D - ASC ratings were observed following individualized dose escalation of 5 - MeO - DMT . Measures of cognition , mood , and well - being were not affected by 5 - MeO - DMT . Vital signs at 1 and 3 h after administration were not affected and adverse events were generally mild and resolved spontaneously .

In preparation for a study in patients with depression , the present study GH001 - HV-101 aimed to assess the impact of four different dose levels of a novel vaporized 5 - MeO - DMT formulation ( GH001 ) administered via inhalation as single doses of 2 ( N = 4 ) , 6 ( N = 6 ) , 12 ( N = 4 ) and 18 mg ( N = 4 ) , and in an individualized dose escalation regimen ( N = 4 ) on the safety , tolerability , and the dose - related psychoactive effects in healthy volunteers ( N = 22 ) . The psychedelic experience was assessed with a novel Peak Experience Scale ( PES ) , the Mystical Experience Questionnaire ( MEQ ) , the Ego Dissolution Inventory ( EDI ) , the Challenging Experience Questionnaire ( CEQ ) , and the 5 - Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire ( 5D - ASC ) . Further aims were to assess the impact of 5 - MeO - DMT on cognitive functioning , mood , and well - being . Higher doses of 5 - MeO - DMT produced significant increments in the intensity of the psychedelic experience ratings as compared to the lowest 2 mg dose on all questionnaires , except the CEQ . Prominent effects were observed following single doses of 6 , 12 , and 18 mg on PES and MEQ ratings , while maximal effects on PES , MEQ , EDI , and 5D - ASC ratings were observed following individualized dose escalation of 5 - MeO - DMT . Measures of cognition , mood , and well - being were not affected by 5 - MeO - DMT . Vital signs at 1 and 3 h after administration were not affected and adverse events were generally mild and resolved spontaneously . Individualized dose escalation of 5 - MeO - DMT may be preferable over single dose administration for clinical applications that aim to maximize the experience to elicit a strong therapeutic response ."

100 mg	2105	1 investigated the effects of 100 mg LSD vs. Placebo and study	"Acute dose - response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^ 
 Background : LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) is a classic hallucinogen . It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy ( psycholytic therapy ) and as a model to study psychotic states . Today , LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [ 1‐3 ] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [ 4 ] . Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions . Methods : Data from two double‐blind , placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships . Study 1 investigated the effects of 100 mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200 mg LSD vs. Placebo . Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design . Twenty‐four subjects ( 12 men , 12 women ; mean age 33±11 years ) participated in Study 1 , and 16 subjects ( 8 men , 8 women ; mean Age 29±6 years ) participated in Study 2 . The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies . Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study . Additional exclusion criteria were age > 65 years , pregnancy , personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders , use of medications that may interfere with the study medication , chronic or acute physical illness , tobacco smoking ( > 10 cigarettes / day ) , and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use > 10 times . Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales , adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale . Heart rate , blood pressure , and pupil size were also recorded . Further , we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships . Results : LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner . Additionally , LSD produced empathic effects such as “ closeness ” “ openness ” , and “ trust ” . Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg . Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours , and up to 10 hours after 100 μg . Negative associated effects , mainly transient anxiety , were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg . LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure , body temperature , and pupil size . LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting . Conclusion : LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects . Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy ."

 Background : LSD ( lysergic acid diethylamide ) is a classic hallucinogen . It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy ( psycholytic therapy ) and as a model to study psychotic states . Today , LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [ 1‐3 ] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [ 4 ] . Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions . Methods : Data from two double‐blind , placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships . Study 1 investigated the effects of 100 mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200 mg LSD vs. Placebo . Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design . Twenty‐four subjects ( 12 men , 12 women ; mean age 33±11 years ) participated in Study 1 , and 16 subjects ( 8 men , 8 women ; mean Age 29±6 years ) participated in Study 2 . The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies . Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study . Additional exclusion criteria were age > 65 years , pregnancy , personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders , use of medications that may interfere with the study medication , chronic or acute physical illness , tobacco smoking ( > 10 cigarettes / day ) , and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use > 10 times . Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales , adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale . Heart rate , blood pressure , and pupil size were also recorded . Further , we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships . Results : LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner . Additionally , LSD produced empathic effects such as “ closeness ” “ openness ” , and “ trust ” . Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg . Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours , and up to 10 hours after 100 μg . Negative associated effects , mainly transient anxiety , were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg . LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure , body temperature , and pupil size . LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting .

 Working memory ( WM ) deficit in schizophrenic patients has been well established . Still , underlying biological substrate of the impairment is not clear . Among neurotransmitter hypotheses of schizophrenia , N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor model is mostly supported , considering that NMDA receptor antagonist can elicit both psychosis and cognitive impairment observed in schizophrenic patients . In current study , to test the neuropsychological and the electrophysiological effects of NMDA receptor in WM , event - related potentials ( ERPs ) of Sternberg 's short - term memory scanning task ( SMST ) were analyzed in 10 healthy subjects under intravenous administration of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine ( 0.65 mg / kg / h ) or placebo ( normal saline ) . Late positive component ( LPC ) of ERP was hypothesized to reflect later stage of WM . Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale score was significantly increased ( t=-5.75 , df=9 , P<.001 ) and correct response rate was significantly decreased ( t=2.21 , df=9 , P=.054 ) after ketamine administration . Neither reaction time nor LPC latency , which reflect memory scanning time , was changed . Amplitude of LPC was significantly reduced after ketamine administration ( z=-2.31 , number of observations=120 , P=.021 ) . In conclusion , NMDA receptor antagonist administration elicited WM deficit both in behavioral and electrophysiological level . Electrophysiological component reflecting later stage of WM was impaired by NMDA antagonist ."

 INTRODUCTION : The use of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) is increasing , enhancing the need for its detection in clinical , workplace , pain management , and driving under the influence of drugs testing programs . Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing , but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid . AIMS : The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration . METHODS : Placebo , low ( 1.0 mg / kg ) , and high ( 1.6 mg / kg ) oral MDMA doses were given double - blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use . One thousand two hundred eighty - six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA , 3,4 - methylenedioxyamphetamine ( MDA ) , 4 - hydroxy-3 - methoxymethamphetamine ( HMMA ) , and 4 - hydroxy-3 - methoxyamphetamine ( HMA ) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry . The limits of quantification were 5 ng / mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng / mL for HMA and HMMA . RESULTS : MDMA was the primary analyte detected , with concentrations up to 12,000 ng / mL in 872 specimens ( 67.8 % ) . MDA was quantified in 656 specimens ( 51.0 % ) at concentrations < 403 ng / mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA . HMA and HMMA were not detected . Of the specimens , 59.8 % , 58.6 % , and 54.9 % were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires ( 20 ng / mL ) , Driving under the Influence of Drugs , Alcohol , and Medicines ( 25 ng / mL ) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration ( 50 ng / mL ) confirmation cutoffs , respectively . MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25 - 1.25 hours after dosing ; MDA was initially detected at 0.5 - 1.75 hours . In general , the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours , respectively , although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours . CONCLUSIONS : Oral fluid monitoring efficiently detects single , recreational 70 - 150 mg of MDMA use for 1 - 2 days .

0.5 mg / kg	3704	dose i.v . ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) or	"Single i.v . ketamine augmentation of newly initiated escitalopram for major depression : results from a randomized , placebo - controlled 4 - week study.^ 
 BACKGROUND : While oral antidepressants reach efficacy after weeks , single - dose intravenous ( i.v . ) ketamine has rapid , yet time - limited antidepressant effects . We aimed to determine the efficacy and safety of single - dose i.v . ketamine augmentation of escitalopram in major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . METHOD : Thirty outpatients with severe MDD ( 17 - item Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression total score ⩾ 24 ) were randomized to 4 weeks double - blind treatment with escitalopram 10 mg / day+single - dose i.v . ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) or escitalopram 10 mg / day + placebo ( 0.9 % i.v . saline ) . Depressive symptoms were measured using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology - Self - Report ( QIDS - SR ) . Suicidal ideation was evaluated with the QIDS - SR item 12 . Adverse psychopathological effects were measured with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS)-positive symptoms , Young Mania Rating Scale ( YMRS ) and Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale ( CADSS ) . Patients were assessed at baseline , 1 , 2 , 4 , 24 and 72 h and 7 , 14 , 21 and 28 days . Time to response ( ⩾ 50 % MADRS score reduction ) was the primary outcome . RESULTS : By 4 weeks , more escitalopram + ketamine - treated than escitalopram + placebo - treated patients responded ( 92.3 % v. 57.1 % , p = 0.04 ) and remitted ( 76.9 % v. 14.3 % , p = 0.001 ) , with significantly shorter time to response [ hazard ratio ( HR ) 0.04 , 95 % confidence interval ( CI ) 0.01 - 0.22 , p < 0.001 ] and remission ( HR 0.11 , 95 % CI 0.02 - 0.63 , p = 0.01 ) . Compared to escitalopram + placebo , escitalopram + ketamine was associated with significantly lower MADRS scores from 2 h to 2 weeks [ ( peak = 3 days-2 weeks ; effect size ( ES ) = 1.08 - 1.18 ) ] , QIDS - SR scores from 2 h to 2 weeks ( maximum ES = 1.27 ) , and QIDS - SR suicidality from 2 to 72 h ( maximum ES = 2.24 ) . Only YMRS scores increased significantly with ketamine augmentation ( 1 and 2 h ) , without significant BPRS or CADSS elevation . CONCLUSIONS : Single - dose i.v . ketamine augmentation of escitalopram was safe and effective in severe MDD , holding promise for speeding up early oral antidepressant efficacy ."

This pharmacologically complex tea , commonly obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis , combines N , N - dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) , an orally labile psychedelic agent showing 5 - hydroxytryptamine2A agonist activity , with monoamine oxidase ( MAO)-inhibiting beta - carboline alkaloids ( harmine , harmaline , and tetrahydroharmine ) . Eighteen volunteers with prior experience in the use of psychedelics received single oral doses of encapsulated freeze - dried ayahuasca ( 0.6 and 0.85 mg of DMT / kg of body weight ) and placebo . Ayahuasca produced significant subjective effects , peaking between 1.5 and 2 h , involving perceptual modifications and increases in ratings of positive mood and activation . Diastolic blood pressure showed a significant increase at the high dose ( 9 mm Hg at 75 min ) , whereas systolic blood pressure and heart rate were moderately and nonsignificantly increased . Cmax values for DMT after the low and high ayahuasca doses were 12.14 ng / ml and 17.44 ng / ml , respectively . Tmax ( median ) was observed at 1.5 h after both doses . The Tmax for DMT coincided with the peak of subjective effects . Drug administration increased urinary normetanephrine excretion , but , contrary to the typical MAO - inhibitor effect profile , deaminated monoamine metabolite levels were not decreased . This and the negligible harmine plasma levels found suggest a predominantly peripheral ( gastrointestinal and liver ) site of action for harmine . MAO inhibition at this level would suffice to prevent first - pass metabolism of DMT and allow its access to systemic circulation and the central nervous system ."

100 mg	2784	double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study . 100 mg MDMA or placebo was administered	"MDMA increases recruitment of social brain areas when interacting with cooperative players during an iterated Prisoner 's Dilemma.^ 
 Introduction : The iterated Prisoner 's Dilemma is used to investigate trust , cooperation and responses to violations of these concepts ; one among a number of social decision‐making tasks which are increasingly being used to study social cognition . The psychopharmacology of the processes underlying behaviour in these tasks is poorly understood . To address this , we carried out a functional neuroimaging study investigating the effect of the potent serotonergic compound , 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) , on cooperation and trust in an iterated Prisoner 's Dilemma ( iPD ) . Methods : Twenty , healthy , male participants were enrolled in to this double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study . 100 mg MDMA or placebo was administered prior to playing an iPD during fMRI scanning . Participants played repeated rounds with ' trustworthy ' ( mostly cooperative ) and ' untrustworthy ' ( mostly uncooperative ) opponents , as well as a non‐social control . On each round participants were asked to Compete or Cooperate , received feedback as to the other player 's decision , and were asked to rate their trust in the other player . Results : MDMA increased cooperation when playing the trustworthy opponents ( OR = 2.01 ( 1.46 ‐ 2.96 ) , p < 0.001 ) , but not when playing untrustworthy opponents ( OR = 1.25 ( 0.73 ‐ 2.13 ) ) or the non‐social control ( OR = 1.05 ( 0.72 ‐ 1.54 ) ) . There was no effect of MDMA on trust ratings . When receiving feedback of the trustworthy players ' decisions , MDMA increased activity in regions involved with social cognition , including the mid‐cingulate gyrus , supplementary motor area , superior temporal sulcus , and bilateral insula . Restricting the analysis to just cooperative feedback from trustworthy players did not appreciably alter the results but revealed increased bilateral putamen activation . No other contrasts showed statistically significant results . Discussion : Increased engagement of social brain regions on MDMA underlies greater tolerance for untrustworthy behaviour of cooperative partners . Furthermore , higher activation of the putamen in response to cooperative behaviour suggests greater social reward processing on MDMA . These results provide evidence for some opponent and process dependent specificity in the role of serotonin in social interactions ."

0.6 mg / kg / h	6427	( n = 9 ; 0.6 mg / kg / h ) group in a double	"NMDA hypofunction in the posterior cingulate as a model for schizophrenia : an exploratory ketamine administration study in fMRI.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Based on animal data , NMDA receptor hypofunction has been suggested as a model for positive symptoms in schizophrenia . NMDA receptor hypofunction affects several corticolimbic brain regions , of which the posterior cingulate seems to be the most sensitive . However , empirical support for a crucial role of posterior cingulate NMDA hypofunction in the pathophysiology of positive symptoms is still missing in humans . We therefore conducted an fMRI study using the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy human subjects during episodic memory retrieval , which is supposed to activate the posterior cingulate . METHODS : We investigated 16 healthy subjects which were assigned to either placebo ( n = 7 ; saline ) or ketamine ( n = 9 ; 0.6 mg / kg / h ) group in a double - blind study design . All subjects received their infusion while performing an episodic memory retrieval task in the scanner . Immediately after the fMRI session , psychopathological effects of ketamine were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire . RESULTS : The placebo group showed BOLD signal increases in the posterior and anterior cingulate during retrieval . Signal increases were significantly lower in the ketamine group . Lower signal increases in the posterior cingulate correlated significantly with positive ( i.e. psychosis - like ) symptoms induced by ketamine . CONCLUSION : The present study for the first time demonstrates a relationship between NMDA receptors , posterior cingulate and positive ( i.e. psychosis - like ) symptoms in humans . Confirming findings from animal studies , it supports the hypothesis of a pathophysiological role of NMDA receptor hypofunction in the posterior cingulate in schizophrenia ."

 3,4 - Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA , "" Ecstasy "" ) releases serotonin and dopamine . The role for dopamine in mediating the effects of MDMA has not yet been examined in humans . We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the dopamine D(2 ) antagonist haloperidol ( 1.4 mg i.v . ) on psychological and physiological responses to MDMA ( 1.5 mg / kg p.o . ) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double - blind placebo - controlled within - subject design . Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales . The physiological effects measured were blood pressure , heart rate and body temperature . Side effects were assessed during the session , and after 1 and 3 days . Haloperidol attenuated MDMA - induced positive and mania - like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects . Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA . In contrast , dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA , indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine ."

 The long - term effects of opioids on sensitization processes are believed to be mediated through the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor . Quantitative sensory testing ( QST ) changes observed after a ketamine infusion have been previously described but the effect that chronic opioids will have is not known . The results of this prospective randomized factorial trial compared the thermal QST changes observed after a .05 mg / kg ketamine infusion or a saline placebo in chronic pain subjects who were either opioid - naive or were chronically using opioids for chronic noncancer pain are presented . No baseline QST differences were noted between the 4 groups at baseline . Comparison of changes preinfusion with postinfusion QST measurements resulted in decreased average change in temporal summation response between opioid subjects who received a placebo compared with those who received a ketamine infusion ( −5.22 , SD = 9.96 vs 13.81 , SD = 19.55 ; P = .004 ) . Additionally , the average change in temporal summation was decreased among subjects who received a ketamine infusion and were not chronically using opioids compared with subjects who were using chronic opioids and received a placebo infusion ( −1.91 , SD = 13.25 vs 13.81 , SD = 19.55 ; P = .007 ) . The results indicate that low - dose ketamine infusions produce subtle changes in QST phenotypes that are modified by the chronic use of opioids . This illustrates the potential diagnostic and therapeutic value of ketamine in the setting of chronic opioid use . ( PsycINFO Database Record ( c ) 2018 APA , all rights reserved )"

 BACKGROUND : Patients with anxious major depressive disorder ( MDD ) are more likely to have poorer outcomes than those with non - anxious MDD . However , the effect of esketamine on adolescents with anxious versus non - anxious MDD has remained unknown . AIMS : We compared the efficacy of esketamine in adolescents with MDD and suicidal ideation , both anxious and non - anxious . METHODS : Fifty - four adolescents with anxious ( n=33 ) and non - anxious ( n=21 ) MDD received three infusions of esketamine 0.25 mg / kg or active - placebo ( midazolam 0.045 mg / kg ) over 5 days , with routine inpatient care and treatment . Suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale . Multiple - sample proportional tests were used to compare the differences between groups on treatment outcomes 24 hours after the final infusion ( day 6 , primacy efficacy endpoint ) and throughout the 4 - week post - treatment ( days 12 , 19 and 33 ) . RESULTS : In subjects who received esketamine , a greater number of patients in the non - anxious group than the anxious group achieved antisuicidal remission on day 6 ( 72.7 % vs 18.8 % , p=0.015 ) and day 12 ( 90.9 % vs 43.8 % , p=0.013 ) , and the non - anxious group had a higher antidepressant remission rate compared with the anxious group on day 33 ( 72.7 % vs 26.7 % , p=0.045 ) . No significant differences in treatment outcomes were observed between the anxious and non - anxious groups at other time points . CONCLUSIONS : Three infusions of esketamine as an adjunct to routine inpatient care and treatment had a greater immediate post - treatment antisuicidal effect in adolescents with non - anxious MDD than in those with anxious MDD ; however , this benefit was temporary and was not maintained over time .

.04 mg / kg	4415	low subperceptual bolus dose ( .04 mg / kg ) of ketamine or placebo	"Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.^ 
 Given the cognitive - promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor ( nAChR ) agonist , nicotine , the increased prevalence of smoke - inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self - correct cognitive deficits , which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain . As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies , this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor ( NMDAR ) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating , in healthy volunteers , the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task . In a randomized , double - blind , placebo controlled study , performance and the P300 event - related brain potential ( ERP ) in a visual information processing ( RVIP ) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non - smokers ( both male and female ) . Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose ( .04 mg / kg ) of ketamine or placebo , which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine ( 4 mg ) or placebo gum . Nicotine - enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers , with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures . Ketamine ’s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine , the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers . These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic - driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia .

0.5 mg / kg	6898	or racemic IV ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) administered 3 times /	"A randomized , crossover comparison of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of major depressive episodes : a Canadian biomarker integration network in depression ( CAN - BIND ) study protocol.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Recent evidence underscores the utility of rapid - acting antidepressant interventions , such as ketamine , in alleviating symptoms of major depressive episodes ( MDE ) . However , to date , there have been limited head - to - head comparisons of intravenous ( IV ) ketamine infusions with other antidepressant treatment strategies in large randomized trials . This study protocol describes an ongoing multi - centre , prospective , randomized , crossover , non - inferiority trial comparing acute treatment of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode ( MDE ) with ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) on efficacy , speed of therapeutic effects , side effects , and health care resource utilization . A secondary aim is to compare a 6 - month maintenance strategy for ketamine responders to standard of care ECT maintenance . Finally , through the measurement of clinical , cognitive , neuroimaging , and molecular markers we aim to establish predictors and moderators of treatment response as well as treatment - elicited effects on these outcomes . METHODS : Across four participating Canadian institutions , 240 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder experiencing a MDE are randomized ( 1:1 ) to a course of ECT or racemic IV ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) administered 3 times / week for 3 or 4 weeks . Non - responders ( < 50 % improvement in Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [ MADRS ] scores ) crossover to receive the alternate treatment . Responders during the randomization or crossover phases then enter the 6 - month maintenance phase during which time they receive clinical assessments at identical intervals regardless of treatment arm . ECT maintenance follows standard of care while ketamine maintenance involves : weekly infusions for 1 month , then bi - weekly infusions for 2 months , and finally monthly infusions for 3 months ( returning to bi - weekly in case of relapse ) . The primary outcome measure is change in MADRS scores after randomized treatment as assessed by raters blind to treatment modality . DISCUSSION : This multi - centre study will help identify molecular , imaging , and clinical characteristics of patients with treatment - resistant and/or severe MDEs who would benefit most from either type of therapeutic strategy . In addition to informing clinical practice and influencing health care delivery , this trial will add to the robust platform and database of CAN - BIND studies for future research and biomarker discovery .

170 µg / kg	6979	on psilocybin - induced ( 170 µg / kg p.o . ) psychological effects	"Modulatory effect of the 5 - HT1A agonist buspirone and the mixed non - hallucinogenic 5 - HT1A/2A agonist ergotamine on psilocybin - induced psychedelic experience.^ 
 The mixed serotonin ( 5 - HT ) 1A/2A/2B/2C/6/7 receptor agonist psilocybin dose - dependently induces an altered state of consciousness ( ASC ) that is characterized by changes in sensory perception , mood , thought , and the sense of self . The psychological effects of psilocybin are primarily mediated by 5 - HT2A receptor activation . However , accumulating evidence suggests that 5 - HT1A or an interaction between 5 - HT1A and 5 - HT2A receptors may contribute to the overall effects of psilocybin . Therefore , we used a double - blind , counterbalanced , within - subject design to investigate the modulatory effects of the partial 5 - HT1A agonist buspirone ( 20 mg p.o . ) and the non - hallucinogenic 5 - HT2A/1A agonist ergotamine ( 3 mg p.o . ) on psilocybin - induced ( 170 µg / kg p.o . ) psychological effects in two groups ( n=19 , n=17 ) of healthy human subjects . Psychological effects were assessed using the Altered State of Consciousness ( 5D - ASC ) rating scale . Buspirone significantly reduced the 5D - ASC main scale score for Visionary Restructuralization ( VR ) ( p<0.001 ) , which was mostly driven by a reduction of the VR item cluster scores for elementary and complex visual hallucinations . Further , buspirone also reduced the main scale score for Oceanic Boundlessness ( OB ) including derealisation and depersonalisation phenomena at a trend level ( p=0.062 ) , whereas ergotamine did not show any effects on the psilocybin - induced 5D - ASC main scale scores . The present finding demonstrates that buspirone exerts inhibitory effects on psilocybin - induced effects , presumably via 5 - HT1A receptor activation , an interaction between 5 - HT1A and 5 - HT2A receptors , or both . The data suggest that the modulation of 5 - HT1A receptor activity may be a useful target in the treatment of visual hallucinations in different psychiatric and neurological diseases ."

 BACKGROUND : Studies have reported that ketamine potentially increases subjective happiness in healthy volunteers . However , whether ketamine - induced happiness can predict the treatment response of ketamine infusion among patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) remains unknown . METHODS : Between 2012 and 2015 , 71 adult patients with TRD ( based on DSM - IV - TR criteria ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40 - minute ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg or 0.2 mg / kg ) or normal saline placebo infusion . Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale . Measurements were conducted prior to infusion , at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion , and , sequentially , on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion . The visual analog scale for happiness ( VASH ) was used to assess happiness during infusion . The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS - P ) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine . RESULTS : For both the 2 - factor ( ketamine vs placebo ) and 3 - factor ( ketamine 0.5 mg / kg vs 0.2 mg / kg vs placebo ) models , a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type ( happiness vs nonhappiness ) significantly ( P = .008 vs P = .002 ) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion . Changes in VASH and BPRS - P measures were not associated with each other . CONCLUSIONS : Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg / kg and 0.2 mg / kg ketamine infusion over time .

METHODS : Between 2012 and 2015 , 71 adult patients with TRD ( based on DSM - IV - TR criteria ) were enrolled and randomly assigned to receive a 40 - minute ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg or 0.2 mg / kg ) or normal saline placebo infusion . Depressive symptoms were measured using the 17 - item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale . Measurements were conducted prior to infusion , at 40 and 240 minutes postinfusion , and , sequentially , on days 2 to 7 and 14 postinfusion . The visual analog scale for happiness ( VASH ) was used to assess happiness during infusion . The positive symptoms subscale of the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale ( BPRS - P ) was used to measure the potential psychotomimetic effects of ketamine . RESULTS : For both the 2 - factor ( ketamine vs placebo ) and 3 - factor ( ketamine 0.5 mg / kg vs 0.2 mg / kg vs placebo ) models , a generalized estimating equation model indicated that infusion response type ( happiness vs nonhappiness ) significantly ( P = .008 vs P = .002 ) predicted the trajectory of depressive symptoms after infusion . Changes in VASH and BPRS - P measures were not associated with each other . CONCLUSIONS : Subjective happiness during ketamine infusion predicted the antidepressant effect of both 0.5 mg / kg and 0.2 mg / kg ketamine infusion over time . Happiness during ketamine infusion , which was not related to the psychotomimetic effect of ketamine , may be associated with the reduction of depressive symptoms during the follow - up .

200 μg	4967	. Method : LSD ( 200 μg ) and placebo were administered	"Autonomic , cardiovascular , and endocrine effects of LSD in healthy subjects.^ 
 Introduction : LSD is used recreationally worldwide and there is renewed interest in using LSD in clinical psychiatric research and practice . However , there is limited data on the somatic and endocrine effects of LSD in humans . Method : LSD ( 200 μg ) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects ( eight women , eight men ) in a double‐blind , randomized , placebo‐controlled , cross‐over study . Cardiostimulant effects ( blood pressure and heart rate ) , autonomic effects ( body temperature and pupillary function ) , endocrine effects , and adverse effects were repeatedly assessed . Results : LSD induced positive mood , visual perceptual alterations , and audio‐visual synesthesia lasting for 12h . LSD significantly increased blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature , and pupil size . LSD elevated the plasma concentrations of cortisol , prolactin , oxytocin , and epinephrine but not norepinephrine . LSD impaired psychomotor performance ( balance ) and produced adverse side effects ( difficulty concentrating , headache , exhaustion , dizziness ) up to 24 h , which completely subsided within 72 h. No severe acute adverse effects were observed . Conclusion : The hallucinogen LSD produces significant sympathomimetic effects . The LSD‐induced increase in cortisol and prolactin is consistent with LSD 's serotonergic properties . The cardiostimulant properties of LSD need to be considered in patients with hypertension or heart disease ."

OBJECTIVES : The aim of this study was to compare the cognitive effects of ketamine with those of triazolam in healthy volunteers . METHODS : Doses of ketamine ( 0.2 , 0.4 mg / kg intramuscular ( i.m . ) ) , triazolam ( 0.2 , 0.4 mg/70 kg p.o . ) , and double - dummy placebos were administered to 20 volunteers under repeated measures , counterbalanced , double - blind conditions . Peak physiological , psychomotor , subjective , and cognitive effects were examined . RESULTS : Ketamine impaired balance when balance was assessed early in the task order , whereas triazolam impaired psychomotor coordination and divided attention irrespective of task order . Triazolam also tended to produce greater effects on working memory and episodic memory tasks than ketamine at doses that produced lower subjective effects and higher estimates of performance . CONCLUSIONS : Ketamine produces less cognitive impairment than triazolam at doses that produced greater subjective effects .

 OBJECTIVES : It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) in patients with major depressive disorder . We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT . METHODS : One hundred twenty - seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized , placebo - controlled , double - blind study . The study group received 0.3 mg / kg ketamine , and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia . The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session . Suicidal ideation ( SI ) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale . The response , remission , and recurrence rates were analyzed using time - to - event analysis . RESULTS : No significant differences were found in the overall response , remission , and relapse rates between the groups ( P > 0.05 ) . The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group ( P < 0.05 ) . The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48 , respectively ( P < 0.05 ) .

0.2‐4.7 mg / kg	808	bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions ( 0.2‐4.7 mg / kg ; 30 minutes ) .	"Combination therapy with transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine for treatment - resistant depression : a long - term retrospe.^ 
 Background : Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation ( rTMS ) is a safe , effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses , including treatment‐resistant depression ( TRD ) . Ketamine , an NMDA receptor antagonist , is also an effective antidepressant . This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine ( CTK ) . Methods : A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar ( n=18 ) or bipolar ( n=10 ) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice . Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS ( 1Hz ; 40 minutes ; 130 % of motor threshold ) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions ( 0.2‐4.7 mg / kg ; 30 minutes ) . The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area . Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness ( 10‐30 sessions ) , which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression ( CGI ) scale . CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment , post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up . Results : Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99 % confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test ( α=0.01 , t=22.81 p < 0.0001 ) . This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion . Conclusions : Despite years of unsuccessful treatments , all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy . Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted ."

 BACKGROUND : Subanesthetic ketamine infusions can elicit rapid and sustained antidepressant effects , yet the potential cognitive impact of ketamine has not been thoroughly examined . This study measured changes in objective and subjective cognitive function following repeated ketamine treatment . METHODS : Thirty - eight patients with treatment - resistant depression were administered cognitive assessments before and after undergoing 7 i.v . ketamine infusions ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 minutes ) within a clinical trial examining the efficacy of single and repeated administrations . Depression severity and perceived concentration were evaluated with the Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) and the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Self - Report . RESULTS : Twenty - three participants ( 60.5 % ) responded after repeated infusions ( ≥50 % decrease in MADRS total scores ) . We measured significant improvements in several cognitive domains , including attention , working memory , verbal , and visuospatial memory ( effect sizes ranging from Cohen d = 0.37 - 0.79 ) . Cognitive changes were attributed to reduction in depressive symptoms except for improvement in verbal memory , which remained significant after adjustment for change in MADRS total score ( P = .029 , η p2 = 0.13 ) . Only responders reported improvement in subjective cognitive function with repeated ketamine administration ( MADRS item 6 , P < .001 , d = 2.00 ; Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms Self - Report item 10 , P < .001 , d = 1.36 ) . CONCLUSION : A short course of repeated ketamine infusions did not impair neurocognitive function in patients with treatment - resistant depression . Further research is required to understand the potential mediating role of response and remission on improved cognitive function accompanying ketamine treatment as well as to examine longer - term safety outcomes .

0.2 mg / kg	3189	moderate dosage of psilocybin , 0.2 mg / kg . Treatment sessions were conducted	"Psilocybin treatment for anxiety in patients with advanced - stage cancer.^ 
 Background : From the late 1950s to the early 1970s clinical research was conducted exploring the use of hallucinogens to treat the existential anxiety , despair and isolation often associated with advanced‐stage cancer . These reports described critically ill individuals undergoing psycho spiritual epiphanies , frequently with sustained improvement in anxiety , mood and quality of life . While these promising investigations were halted because of political and cultural pressures , after a thirty year hiatus the development of hallucinogen treatment research for patients with anxiety reactive to advanced‐stage cancer has resumed . Methods : This presentation examines the rationale , methodology and results of a pilot investigation using psilocybin to treat the existential anxiety associated with advanced‐stage cancer . Psilocybin , the active alkaloid in hallucinogenic mushrooms and a 5‐HT2A and 5‐HT2C agonist , was administered to 12 screened subjects diagnosed with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety . A double‐blind , placebo‐controlled methodology was employed , utilizing a moderate dosage of psilocybin , 0.2 mg / kg . Treatment sessions were conducted on the Clinical Research Unit at Harbor‐UCLA Medical Center . Results : Safe physiological and psychological responses were documented during treatment sessions . There were no clinically significant adverse events with psilocybin . The State‐Trait Anxiety Inventory trait anxiety subscale demonstrated a significant reduction in anxiety at 1 and 3 months after treatment . The Beck Depression Inventory revealed an improvement of mood that reached significance at 6 months ; the Profile of Mood States identified mood improvement after treatment with psilocybin that approached but did not reach significance . Conclusions : This study establishes the feasibility and safety of administering moderate doses of psilocybin to patients with advanced‐stage cancer and anxiety . Some of the data revealed a positive trend toward improved mood and anxiety . These results support the need for more research in this long‐neglected field . To that end , two new studies using psilocybin to treat cancer anxiety , at Johns Hopkins and New York University , are currently on‐going . Both of these investigations are evaluating higher doses than used in the Harbor‐UCLA study , allowing for greater exploration of the role of psycho‐spiritual or transcendent states of consciousness in facilitating therapeutic outcomes ."
100 mg	8970	administered MDMA - HCl ( 100 mg p.o . ) and ,	"Altered Insula Connectivity under MDMA.^ 
 Recent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to investigate the effects of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) on large - scale patterns of brain activity . MDMA , a potent monoamine - releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin- releasing properties , has unique subjective effects that include : marked positive mood , pleasant / unusual bodily sensations and pro - social , empathic feelings . However , the neurobiological basis for these effects is not properly understood , and the present analysis sought to address this knowledge gap . To do this , we administered MDMA - HCl ( 100 mg p.o . ) and , separately , placebo ( ascorbic acid ) in a randomized , double - blind , repeated - measures design with twenty - five healthy volunteers undergoing fMRI scanning . We then employed a measure of global resting - state functional brain connectivity and follow - up seed - to - voxel analysis to the fMRI data we acquired . Results revealed decreased right insula / salience network functional connectivity under MDMA . Furthermore , these decreases in right insula / salience network connectivity correlated with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily sensations under MDMA . The present findings highlight insular disintegration ( ie , compromised salience network membership ) as a neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience , and relate this brain effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations - both of which are known to be associated with insular functioning ."

 Ketamine may exert pro - cognitive effects on select measures of cognition in adults with mood disorders . We evaluated the effectiveness of intravenous ( IV ) ketamine on cognition in 68 adult outpatients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) at the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence between July 3 , 2018 and April 16 , 2020 ( NCT04209296 ) . Eligibility criteria for the present retrospective study included : primary diagnosis of major depressive or bipolar disorder ; currently depressed ; and insufficient response to two or more prior treatments . Participants received four infusions of ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 - 0.75 mg / kg ) over 1 - 2 weeks . We assessed objective and subjective measures of cognition before and after two infusions , i.e. , Digit Symbol Substitution Test ( DSST ) , Trail Making Test - B ( TMT - B ) , Patient Deficits Questionnaire , 5 - item ( PDQ-5 - D ) . Ketamine significantly improved DSST ( effect size [ ES]=0.60 ) , TMT - B ( ES=0.84 ) , as well as PDQ-5 - D scores ( ES=0.63 ) , indicative of a moderate - to - large effect size . Improvements in DSST and PDQ-5 - D with ketamine were mediated by reductions in depressive symptoms , whereas improvements in TMT - B were independent of changes in depressive symptoms . Our results support the independent , rapid - onset , pro - cognitive effects with IV ketamine in adults with TRD . Larger , randomized , controlled trials with ketamine wherein cognition is the primary outcome measure in mood and non - mood disorder samples are warranted ."

0.6 mg / kg	5684	infusion of low dose ( 0.6 mg / kg ) intravenous ketamine compared with	"A single infusion of intravenous ketamine improves pain relief in patients with critical limb ischaemia : results of a double blind randomised controlled trial.^ 
 We report the first double blind randomised controlled trial of regular opioids and an infusion of low dose ( 0.6 mg / kg ) intravenous ketamine compared with opioids and placebo in patients with allodynia , hyperalgesia and hyperpathia secondary to critical limb ischaemia . Thirty - five patients completed the study , 18 received regular opioids plus ketamine , while 17 received regular opioids plus placebo . Using the Brief Pain Inventory , the % pain relief that the patients in the ketamine group attributed to their medication improved significantly from 50 % immediately pre - infusion to 65 % 24 h post - infusion and 69 % 5 days post infusion . Over the same period , the pain relief achieved by the placebo group rose from 58 % pre - infusion to 56 % 24 h post infusion and then 50 % relief 5 days later . This was statistically significant ( P<0.05 ) using both the t - test and the Wilcoxon Rank Sum test . The ketamine group also showed a statistically significant difference 24 h post infusion of the effect of pain on their general activity ( P=0.03 ) and on their enjoyment of life ( P=0.004 ) .

 MDMA is a stimulant - like drug with distinctive empathogenic effects . Its pro - social effects , such as feelings of connectedness , may contribute to both its popularity as a recreational drug and its apparent value as an adjunct to psychotherapy . However , little is known about the behavioral processes by which MDMA affects social interactions . This investigation examined the effects of MDMA ( 100 mg versus placebo ; N = 18 ) on feelings of connectedness with an unfamiliar partner during a semi - structured casual conversation . A separate study examined the effects of a prototypic stimulant methamphetamine ( MA ; 20 mg versus placebo ; N = 19 ) to determine the pharmacological specificity of effects . Oxytocin levels were obtained in both studies . Compared to placebo , both MDMA and MA increased feelings of connection with the conversation partners . Both MDMA and MA increased oxytocin levels , but oxytocin levels were correlated with feeling closer to the partner only after MDMA . These findings demonstrate an important new dimension of the pro - social effects of MDMA , its ability to increase feelings of connectedness during casual conversations between two individuals . Surprisingly , MA had a similar effect . The findings extend our knowledge of the social effects of these drugs , and illustrate a sensitive method for assessing pro - social effects during in - person dyadic encounters ."

 Objective : To date , treatment options ( i.e. psychotherapy , antidepressant medications ) for patients with posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) , are relatively few , and considering their limited efficacy , novel therapies have gained interest among researchers and treatment providers alike . Among patients with chronic pain ( CP ) about one third experience comorbid PTSD , which further complicates their already challenging pharmacological regimens . Low dose ketamine infusion has shown promise in PTSD , and in treatment of CP , however they have not been studied in comorbid population and under rigorous control conditions . Methods : We compared the effects of a single dose of either ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or ketorolac ( 15 mg ) over a 40 - minute of IV infusion in CP patients with and without PTSD , in double blind , randomized study . Measures were collected before , during , one day and seven days after the infusion . A planned sample size of 40 patients randomly assigned to treatment order was estimated to provide 80 % power to detect a hypothesized treatment difference after the infusion . Main Outcome and Measures : The primary outcome measures were change in PTSD symptom severity assessed with the Impact of Event Scale – Revised ( IES - R ) and Visual Analogue Scale ( VAS ) for pain administered by a study clinician 24 hours post infusion . Secondary outcome measures included Impact of Event Scale – Revised ( IES - R ) , VAS and Brief Pain Inventory ( Short Form ) for pain 1 week after the infusion . Results : Both treatments offered comparable improvement of PTSD and CP symptoms that persisted for 7 days after the infusion . Patients with comorbid PTSD and CP experienced less dissociative side effects compared to the CP group . Surprisingly , ketorolac infusion resulted in dissociative symptoms in CP patients only . Conclusions : This first prospective study comparing effects of subanesthetic ketamine versus ketorolac infusions for comorbid PTSD and CP , suggests that both ketamine and ketorolac might offer meaningful and durable response for both PTSD and CP symptoms .

0.5mg / kg	8087	hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg / kg over 40 minutes or placebo	"A single - infusion of the N - methyl - D - aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine improves fatigue scores in patients with bipolar disorder compared to placebo.^ 
 Background : Fatigue is a highly prevalent residual symptom of depression that is difficult to treat with current monoaminergic antidepressants . Research has shown that ketamine , an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate ( NMDA ) receptor antagonist that manipulates the glutamate system , produces rapid , robust , and moderately sustained improvements in depressive symptoms . However , there is a dearth of literature examining the effects of ketamine on fatigue specifically . We hypothesized that ketamine would rapidly improve fatigue symptoms in treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients . Methods : In a double‐blind , randomized , placebo‐controlled , crossover study , 36 participants with treatment‐resistant bipolar depression ( maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate ) received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg / kg over 40 minutes or placebo on 2 experimental days separated by 2 weeks . A post‐hoc analysis compared fatigue scores on ketamine vs. placebo from 40 minutes through 14 days using a novel scale ( based on questions from validated rating scales ) . Results : A linear mixed model showed that patients had significantly lower fatigue scores following ketamine compared to placebo from 40 minutes ( p=.002 ) through day 3 ( p<.001 ) . The drug difference was not significant at day 7 ( p=.10 ) , but it was at day 10 ( p=.03 ) and 14 ( p=.004 ) . The largest difference was at day 2 ( p<.001 ; d=.58 ) . Conclusions : Ketamine rapidly and significantly improved fatigue symptoms relative to placebo in a group of treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients . Unlike current monoaminergic antidepressants that fail to alleviate fatigue in depression , the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine may provide swift and robust improvements to fatigue in depressed patients ."

 BACKGROUND : Ketamine has been demonstrated to improve depressive symptoms . AimsEvaluation of efficacy , safety and feasibility of repeated oral ketamine for out - patients with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . METHOD : In a randomised , double - blind , placebo - controlled , proof - of - concept trial , 41 participants received either 1 mg / kg oral ketamine or placebo thrice weekly for 21 days ( ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier : NCT02037503 ) . Evaluation was performed at baseline , 40 and 240 min post administration and on days 3 , 7 , 14 and 21 . The main outcome measure was change in Montgomery - Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) . RESULTS : Twenty - two participants were randomised to the ketamine group , and 19 to the control , with 82.5 % ( n = 33 ) completing the study . In the ketamine group , a decrease in depressive symptoms was evident at all time points , whereas in the control group a decrease was evident only 40 min post administration . The reduction in MADRS score on day 21 was 12.75 in the ketamine group versus 2.49 points with placebo ( P & lt ; 0.001 ) . Six participants in the ketamine group ( 27.3 % ) achieved remission compared with none of the controls ( P & lt ; 0.05 ) . The number needed to treat for remission was 3.7 . Side - effects were mild and transient . CONCLUSIONS : Repeated oral ketamine produced rapid and persistent amelioration of depressive symptoms in out - patients with TRD , and was well tolerated . These results suggest that add - on oral ketamine may hold significant promise in the care of patients suffering from TRD in the community . Declaration of interestNone ."
0.54 mg / kg	3662	acute effect of ketamine ( 0.54 mg / kg within 30 min ) on	"Subanesthetic dose of ketamine decreases prefrontal theta cordance in healthy volunteers : implications for antidepressant effect.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Theta cordance is a novel quantitative electroencephalography ( QEEG ) measure that correlates with cerebral perfusion . A series of clinical studies has demonstrated that the prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after 1 week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and that this effect precedes clinical improvement . Ketamine , a non - competitive antagonist of N - methyl - D - aspartate ( NMDA ) receptors , has a unique rapid antidepressant effect but its influence on theta cordance is unknown . METHOD : In a double - blind , cross - over , placebo - controlled experiment we studied the acute effect of ketamine ( 0.54 mg / kg within 30 min ) on theta cordance in a group of 20 healthy volunteers . RESULTS : Ketamine infusion induced a decrease in prefrontal theta cordance and an increase in the central region theta cordance after 10 and 30 min . The change in prefrontal theta cordance correlated with ketamine and norketamine blood levels after 10 min of ketamine infusion . CONCLUSIONS : Our data indicate that ketamine infusion immediately induces changes similar to those that monoamineric - based antidepressants induce gradually . The reduction in theta cordance could be a marker and a predictor of the fast - acting antidepressant effect of ketamine , a hypothesis that could be tested in depressive patients treated with ketamine ."
0.5 mg / kg	2431	of either ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or placebo on 2	"Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder Measured Up to 10 Days After Ketamine Administration.^ 
 BACKGROUND : The symptoms of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine . However , few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion . This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network ( DMN ) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects ( HCs ) . METHODS : Data were drawn from a double - blind , placebo - controlled crossover study of 58 participants ( 33 with MDD and 25 HCs ) who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride ( 0.5 mg / kg ) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart . Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions . The DMN was defined using seed - based correlation and was compared across groups and scans . RESULTS : In subjects with MDD , connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion . This change was reversed after 10 days and did not appear in either of the placebo scans . Group - specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed , most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs . CONCLUSIONS : Connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks , supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD ."

In recent years , studies have found that ketamine has rapid onset antidepressant effect . However , the use of ketamine for antidepressant treatment has the risk of causing adverse reactions such as psychiatric symptoms , addiction , and so on . The aim of this study is to find DNA methylation sites related to the efficacy of ketamine and screening‐related genes . It will be the foundation of the accurate use of ketamine for depression . Methods : This study included a randomized , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study of brain tumors with depression . The subjects received a small dose of ketamine intravenously ( 0.5mg / kg , 40 minutes ) during the operation . The Montgomery‐ Åsberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) was used to assess depression . According to the improvement of depression on the third day after operation , patients were divided into an effective group ( MADRS score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 50 % ) and an ineffective group ( MADRS score reduction rate is less than 50 % ) . Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip ( 850 K DNA methylation chip ) was used to carry out genomewide methylation of peripheral blood in two groups . The methylation sites with significant difference between the two groups ( p < 0.05 ) were compared . According to the difference of methylation beta and the difference score , bioinformatics analysis was carried out using GO analysis and Pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to select chloramine . Ketone therapy is associated with different DNA methylation levels . Results : A total of 34 subjects using ketamine were included in this study , of who 20 were in the ineffective group and 14 were in the effective group . A total of 34,140 differentially methylated sites were identified by 850 K DNA methylation chip screening . These differentially methylated sites were located on 13,209 genes . Through bioinformatics screening , we have identified 39 genes related to multiple pathways as the basis for subsequent research . Conclusion : It was found that many metabolic and signaling pathways were involved in the factors affecting the efficacy of ketamine . Through bioinformatics analysis and literature review , 39 anti‐ketamine drugs were screened out . Genes related to the efficacy of depression lay the foundation for future research ."

 The acute psychoactive , autonomic , and endocrine effects of the new psychoactive substance ( NPS ) 5,6 - methylenedioxy-2 - aminoindane ( MDAI ; 3.0 mg / kg , range 180 - 228 mg ) were investigated in six healthy volunteers ( four males , two females ) in a non - blinded fashion without placebo . Subjective , cardiovascular , and endocrine responses were compared with two different doses of 3,4 - methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) ( 75 mg and 125 mg ) described in previously published placebo - controlled studies , which used identical outcome measures including Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) , the Adjective Mood Rating Scale ( AMRS ) , and the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness ( 5D - ASC ) scale . MDAI was well tolerated and produced subjective effects comparable with those of 125 mg MDMA . MDAI increased blood pressure similar to 125 mg MDMA but did not increase heart rate or body temperature . MDAI increased cortisol and prolactin levels and could be detected in serum about 20 min post ingestion and remained detectable at least for 4 days . In urine , MDAI was detectable over a period of at least 6 days . Further clinical investigations are warranted to assess whether MDAI could serve as drug with medicinal properties ."

 Background : There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook . Yet , the effects of such “ microdoses ” have not been tested under double‐blind , placebo‐controlled conditions . As a first step , we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults . Methods : Volunteers ( N=20 ) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo , 6.5μg , 13μg , or 26μg LSD in randomized order . During expected peak drug effect , they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing , including i ) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii ) responses to simulated social rejection . Results : LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “ feeling ” the drug , “ liking ” the drug , and “ feeling high , ” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire . The highest dose of LSD increased vigor , elation , and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States . On the emotion recognition task , LSD enhanced participants ’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness . During the simulated social rejection task , LSD increased participants ’ desire to play again with the other players , but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded . Conclusions : These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “ microdoses ” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior . These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood , and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community .

150 mg	4236	solution of racemic ketamine ( 150 mg ) across 10 - 15	"The efficacy of oral ketamine in severely depressed patients at high risk of suicide.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Ketamine is most easily and inexpensively administered by the oral route and in racemic form . Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings , especially in third world countries , that have a limited range of available healthcare resources . METHODS : In a prospective , uncontrolled , open - label investigation , we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk . Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine ( 150 mg ) across 10 - 15 min in 3 alternate day sessions . Patients were assessed using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation ( MSSI ) , Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) , and Clinical Global Improvement - Severity ( CGI - S ) scale at baseline and 1 day after the last ketamine session . RESULTS : There was statistically and clinically significant improvement on all outcomes . Mean ( standard deviation ) MSSI scores dropped from 25.1(1.8 ) to 17.3(5.6 ) , MADRS scores from 28.8(3.4 ) to 21.9(3.6 ) , and CGI - S scores from 6.0(0.2 ) to 3.6(0.9 ) . At endpoint , MSSI scores had dropped from severe to low or mild - to - moderate in 67 % of patients . The 90 ketamine sessions were uneventful ; the treatment was well tolerated and no patient dropped out . CONCLUSION : Oral racemic ketamine may be a useful and potentially life - saving approach to the emergency management of severely depressed patients at high risk of suicide ."

 Rapid on - site tests for the analysis of drugs of abuse in unconventional specimens ( e.g. , sweat ) have recently been developed . Two healthy volunteers familiar with the effects of methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) were given 100 mg of the drug as a single oral dose . MDMA and its main metabolite 4 - hydroxy-3 - methoxymethamphetamine ( HMMA ) were determined in plasma and urine by gas chromatography - mass spectrometry ( GC - MS ) . MDMA was also investigated in sweat with the Drugwipe ( an immunochemical strip test ) . Subjects ' armpits were swabbed for 10 s at 0 time ( predose ) and at 2 , 6 , 8 , 12 , and 24 h after MDMA administration . MDMA consumption could be detected using Drugwipe at 2 h and for as long as 12 h after drug administration . However , in one of the volunteers , a faint color change appeared at 0 time , when plasma and urine tested negative for MDMA and did not disappear even 48 h later . Plasma concentrations of MDMA and HMMA measured by GC - MS peaked at 2 - 4 h , and values greater than 20 ng / mL for MDMA and of 40 ng / mL for HMMA were still detected at 24 h. Urine tested positive by GC - MS for MDMA and HMMA in the 48 - h collection period . These findings preliminarily support sweat testing with Drugwipe for monitoring MDMA use ."

 BACKGROUND : Electroconvulsive therapy ( ECT ) is a preferred therapy for major depressive disorder . Intravenous propofol , a sedative and hypnotic agent , is one of the choices of anesthetic for ECT . Ketamine , another anesthetic agent , providing sedation , amnesia , and analgesia , can also be used in patients undergoing ECT owing to its rapid action and persistent antidepressive effect . One adverse effect of ketamine is cardiovascular excitement , which may be reduced by propofol . Currently , the effects of combined anesthesia ( propofol and ketamine ) for patients with depressive disorder who have undergone ECT are unclear . The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined agents for patients undergoing ECT . METHODS : Forty - eight patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale ( HDRS ) scores greater than 20 were randomly divided into 3 groups ( n=16 each ): propofol group ( group P ) , ketamine group ( group K ) , and propofol plus ketamine group ( group PK ) . Propofol ( 1.5 mg / kg ) , ketamine ( 0.8 mg / kg ) , and propofol ( 1.5 mg / kg ) plus ketamine ( 0.8 mg / kg ) were infused to each group of patients , respectively , before ECT by an anesthesiologist with no knowledge of the HDRS score . For the purpose of this study , the patients received a single ECT treatment and were assessed for depression using the HDRS scores ( 1 day before ECT and days 1 , 2 , 3 , and 7 after the ECT treatment ) by a psychiatrist with no knowledge of the randomization group . After the final assessment , the patients received further treatment as needed up to 3 treatments per week . Seizure energy index , seizure duration , and adverse effects were observed during anesthesia by a nurse with no knowledge of the study group . RESULTS : The HDRS scores improved earlier in group K and group PK . Decreases in HDRS scores were significantly greater in group K and group PK compared with those in group P. The adverse effects in group PK were fewer than those in group K. Seizure energy index and seizure duration in group K and group PK were higher and longer than those in group P during ECT .

Mood ( MADRS ) and psychiatric ( BPRS , CADSS ) outcomes were assessed by a blinded rater : pre‐treatment , 4 hours , 24 hours , 4 days , 7 days after each treatment . A mixed effects repeated measures model ( MERM ) was used to examine the effects of route and dose on mood scores . Results : 8/15 subjects responded to treatment at ≤ 0.2 mg / kg . Groups did not differ in mean % MADRS change ( IV 65 % , IM 52 % , SC 68 % ) . For all routes , maximal response was at 24 hours . MERM analysis for doses 0.1 , 0.2 mg / kg yielded main effects : route ( NS ) , dose ( p=0.038 ) , time ( linear , p=0.014 ; quadratic , p=0.005 ) , and time x dose interactions ( linear , p=0.057 ; quadratic , p=0.056 ) . Transient mild elevations in BPRS and CADSS scores ( resolving by 4 hours ) were seen after ketamine but not placebo in all 3 groups and tended to be dose related . Other side effects ( e.g. blood pressure increase ) were most marked in the IV group . Conclusions : The SC route resulted in similar efficacy and milder side effects than the IV route . Doses ≤0.5 mg / kg may be effective in treating depression ."
0.5 mg / kg	5047	intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) over	"Baseline insomnia as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy to repeated intravenous ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression : A preliminary study.^ 
 OBJECTIVE : Ketamine has been demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects , and few studies have focused on the relationship between insomnia and the efficacy of ketamine . The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression . METHOD : Patients with high insomnia ( n = 64 ) or low insomnia ( n = 68 ) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg over 40 min ) over 12 days ( Monday - Wednesday - Friday ) . The Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) without sleep item was used to assess depressive symptoms . Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50 % , and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10 . RESULT : There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia . However , the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission . Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia . A linear mixed model showed that the high insomnia subgroup had greater improvement than the low insomnia subgroup ( all p < 0.05 ) . LIMITATION : The major limitation of this study is the open - label design . CONCLUSION : When given six ketamine infusions , patients with high insomnia were more likely to respond and remit than those with low insomnia . Patients with high insomnia showed not only a shorter latency to respond and remit , but also greater improvement than those with low insomnia ."
0.5 - 1mg / kg	1981	weekly subcutaneous esketamine infusions ( 0.5 - 1mg / kg ) . Anhedonia was measured	"Comparative effectiveness of esketamine in the treatment of anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Anhedonia is a symptom associated with poorer outcomes in depression treatment , including resistance to treatment , higher functional impact and suicidality . Few drugs are known to adequately treat anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depression . The NMDA antagonist ketamine has been demonstrated to be effective in rapidly ameliorating anhedonia in depressive episodes . The main aim of present study is to evaluate the anti - anhedonic effect of esketamine , the S - enantiomer of ketamine recently approved for treatment - resistant depression , in unipolar and bipolar depression . METHODS : 70 patients with unipolar or bipolar depression were treated with 6 weekly subcutaneous esketamine infusions ( 0.5 - 1mg / kg ) . Anhedonia was measured through MADRS item 8 before and 24h after each infusion . RESULTS : A significant reduction in anhedonia severity was observed ( p<0.0001 ) after 6 infusions . The effect was statistically significant 24h after the first infusion ( p<0.001 ) in both unipolar and bipolar groups and increased with repeated infusions . Anti - anhedonic effect of esketamine did not differ between groups . LIMITATIONS : This is an open - label , real - world study . Lack of blinding and of a placebo arm may limit the interpretation of findings . CONCLUSION : Although preliminary , present findings suggest that repeated subcutaneous esketamine infusions are effective for the treatment of anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depressed patients . These results need to be confirmed through replication in larger double - blinded controlled trials ."

 MDMA given at recreational doses ( range tested 50 to 150 mg ) to healthy volunteers , produced mydriasis and marked increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure , heart rate , and pupillary diameter . MDMA induced changes on oral temperature . The time course of this observation was biphasic , as a slight decrease at 1 h and a slight increase at 2 and 4 h were observed . MDMA induced a slight dose - dependent impairment on psychomotor performance . MDMA produced a marked rise in plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations . The elimination half - life of MDMA was about 8 - 9 h. Drug concentrations increased , and a parallel increase in physiologic and hormonal measures was observed . Both peak concentrations and peak effects were obtained between 1 and 2 h and decreased to baseline values 4 - 6 h after drug administration ."

 This study aimed to explore the effect of prophylactic ketamine administration on postpartum depression in Chinese woman undergoing cesarean section . This randomized controlled study included 654 Chinese women undergoing cesarean section . At 10 min after child birth , patients in the ketamine group were given 0.5 mg / kg ketamine , whereas patients in the control group received standard postpartum care . At the end of operation , all patients were armed with a patient - controlled intravenous analgesia device . The primary outcome was the prevalence of postpartum depression ( PPD ) , as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale ( EPDS ) , and the secondary outcomes included the safety assessment and the Numerical Rating Scale ( NRS ) of postoperative pain . The prevalence of postpartum blues and postpartum depression were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group . Logistic analysis showed that ketamine administration protected against postpartum depression , and PPD - associated risk factors included stress during pregnancy , antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation . In addition , the antidepressive effect of prophylactic ketamine was stronger in mothers with a history of moderate stress during pregnancy , antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation . Our findings suggest that ketamine functions as a prophylactic agent against PPD ."
100 μg	8292	healthy adults who were administered 100 μg of LSD or placebo .	"Effective Connectivity of Functionally Anticorrelated Networks Under Lysergic Acid Diethylamide.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Classic psychedelic - induced ego dissolution involves a shift in the sense of self and a blurring of the boundary between the self and the world . A similar phenomenon is identified in psychopathology and is associated with the balance of anticorrelated activity between the default mode network , which directs attention inward , and the salience network , which recruits the dorsal attention network to direct attention outward . METHODS : To test whether changes in anticorrelated networks underlie the peak effects of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) , we applied dynamic causal modeling to infer effective connectivity of resting - state functional magnetic resonance imaging scans from a study of 25 healthy adults who were administered 100 μg of LSD or placebo . RESULTS : We found that inhibitory effective connectivity from the salience network to the default mode network became excitatory , and inhibitory effective connectivity from the default mode network to the dorsal attention network decreased under the peak effect of LSD . CONCLUSIONS : The effective connectivity changes we identified may reflect diminution of the functional anticorrelation between resting - state networks that may be a key neural mechanism of LSD and underlie ego dissolution . Our findings suggest that changes to the sense of self and subject - object boundaries across different states of consciousness may depend upon the organized balance of effective connectivity of resting - state networks ."

75 µg	1272	. Participants received LSD ( 75 µg , intravenously ) on one	"The paradoxical psychological effects of lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD).^ 
 BACKGROUND : Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) is a potent serotonergic hallucinogen or psychedelic that modulates consciousness in a marked and novel way . This study sought to examine the acute and mid - term psychological effects of LSD in a controlled study . METHOD : A total of 20 healthy volunteers participated in this within - subjects study . Participants received LSD ( 75 µg , intravenously ) on one occasion and placebo ( saline , intravenously ) on another , in a balanced order , with at least 2 weeks separating sessions . Acute subjective effects were measured using the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire and the Psychotomimetic States Inventory ( PSI ) . A measure of optimism ( the Revised Life Orientation Test ) , the Revised NEO Personality Inventory , and the Peter 's Delusions Inventory were issued at baseline and 2 weeks after each session . RESULTS : LSD produced robust psychological effects ; including heightened mood but also high scores on the PSI , an index of psychosis - like symptoms . Increased optimism and trait openness were observed 2 weeks after LSD ( and not placebo ) and there were no changes in delusional thinking . CONCLUSIONS : The present findings reinforce the view that psychedelics elicit psychosis - like symptoms acutely yet improve psychological wellbeing in the mid to long term . It is proposed that acute alterations in mood are secondary to a more fundamental modulation in the quality of cognition , and that increased cognitive flexibility subsequent to serotonin 2A receptor ( 5 - HT2AR ) stimulation promotes emotional lability during intoxication and leaves a residue of ' loosened cognition ' in the mid to long term that is conducive to improved psychological wellbeing ."

 Background : Lysergic acid diethylamide ( LSD ) is increasingly used in clinical research . The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders . Methods : We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo‐controlled , double‐blind , cross‐over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects . Additionally , acute effects of LSD ( 0.1‐0.2 mg ) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life‐threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo‐controlled clinical trial . Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales ( VASs ) , the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness ( 5D‐ASC ) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire ( MEQ ) . Results : In healthy subjects , LSD acutely and dose‐dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness , trust and closeness to others on the VASs . On the 5D‐ASC , LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state , insightfulness , and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg .

 Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5‐HT2A / C and 5‐HT1A receptors . It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression , anxiety , and addiction . It has been already shown that psychedelics , including psilocybin , acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication . However , understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet . Therefore , the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication . Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio ( 10 male/10 female ) entered the study . Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin ( 0.26 mg / kg ) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design . In most of the subjects , psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales , the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration . Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region , which diminished over time was the most robust finding . The connectivity analyses showed biphasic effect on overall connectivity indicating two different connectivity states at the peak of intoxication and 6 hours after the ingestion . Results will be discussed in relation to the potential therapeutic effects of psilocybin ."

MDMA produced a time - dependent decrease in the CD4 / CD8 T - cell ratio due to a decrease in the number of CD4 T - helper cells , a decrease in the functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation , and a simultaneous increase in natural killer cells . In case of two 100 mg MDMA doses given 4 hour apart , immune alterations produced by the first dose were strengthened by the second one . At 24 hours after treatment , statistically significant residual effects were observed for all the altered immune parameters after the administration of two MDMA doses if compared to single dose and placebo . In the second clinical trial , the second 100 mg MDMA dose given 24 hours after the first dose produced immunological changes significantly greater than those induced by the initial drug administration and which seemed to show a delayed onset . Significant residual effects were observed for all the immune parameters as late as 48 hours after the second dose .

1 mg DMT kg(-1 )	594	an ayahuasca dose equivalent to 1 mg DMT kg(-1 ) body weight , and 20	"Daytime Ayahuasca administration modulates REM and slow - wave sleep in healthy volunteers.^ 
 OBJECTIVES : Ayahuasca is a traditional South American psychoactive beverage and the central sacrament of Brazilian - based religious groups , with followers in Europe and the United States . The tea contains the psychedelic indole N , N - dimethyltryptamine ( DMT ) and beta - carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase - inhibiting properties that render DMT orally active . DMT interacts with serotonergic neurotransmission acting as a partial agonist at 5 - HT(1A ) and 5 - HT(2A/2C ) receptor sites . Given the role played by serotonin in the regulation of the sleep / wake cycle , we investigated the effects of daytime ayahuasca consumption in sleep parameters . MEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS : Subjective sleep quality , polysomnography ( PSG ) , and spectral analysis were assessed in a group of 22 healthy male volunteers after the administration of a placebo , an ayahuasca dose equivalent to 1 mg DMT kg(-1 ) body weight , and 20 mg d - amphetamine , a proaminergic drug , as a positive control . Results show that ayahuasca did not induce any subjectively perceived deterioration of sleep quality or PSG - measured disruptions of sleep initiation or maintenance , in contrast with d - amphetamine , which delayed sleep initiation , disrupted sleep maintenance , induced a predominance of ' light ' vs ' deep ' sleep and significantly impaired subjective sleep quality . PSG analysis also showed that similarly to d - amphetamine , ayahuasca inhibits rapid eye movement ( REM ) sleep , decreasing its duration , both in absolute values and as a percentage of total sleep time , and shows a trend increase in its onset latency . Spectral analysis showed that d - amphetamine and ayahuasca increased power in the high frequency range , mainly during stage 2 . Remarkably , whereas slow - wave sleep ( SWS ) power in the first night cycle , an indicator of sleep pressure , was decreased by d - amphetamine , ayahuasca enhanced power in this frequency band . CONCLUSIONS : Results show that daytime serotonergic psychedelic drug administration leads to measurable changes in PSG and sleep power spectrum and suggest an interaction between these drugs and brain circuits modulating REM and SWS ."

The acute and short‐term effects of psilocybin ( the psychoactive compound of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms ) on several variables will be investigated , comprising spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological brain activity , perception and cognitive function ( cognitive flexibility , attention , inhibitory control , conscious access , visual perception ) , creativity ( problem solving , divergent and convergent thinking ) , behavior ( actigraphy and sleep patterns , natural language production ) and several domains related to well‐being and mental health of the participants . This study is simultaneously naturalistic ( i.e. recruited subjects are intrinsically motivated to microdose , as they have decided to embark in a microdosing protocol ) and controlled by expectations , following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design . Participants will microdose according to the following schedule : Two sessions ( 0.5 g dried Psilocybin mushrooms vs. dried edible mushroom material without psychoactive effects as a placebo condition ) will be conducted . A third party will be in charge of generating their active dose and placebo capsules , and they will also implement a blinding procedure . Each session will span one week of measurements . Subjects will be given a smartwatch to monitor activity and sleeping patterns at the beginning of the week . At days 3 and 5 , subjects will take capsules with active mushroom material or placebo , and then several variables will be recorded . Experiments will be conducted in a setting that is natural and comfortable for the participants , e.g. their homes . The main outcome measures consist of resting state activity recorded with EEG , evoked response potentials and performance during cognitive tasks , behavioral variables obtained with actigraphy and automated sleep scoring , natural language analysis , and several measurs self‐reported via standarized questionnaires . After completion , this study will provide direct evidence concerning the efficacy of microdosing for cognitive enhancement under natural conditions , i.e. those most frequently used by individuals who microdose , as well as provide information concerning the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms ."
10 mg	7521	to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as	"Psilocybin administration to healthy participants : safety and feasibility in a placebo - controlled study.^ 
 Background : Treatment‐resistant depression ( TRD ) remains a significant unmet medical need . From an antidepressant drug development perspective , interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology . Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ( ' mindmanifesting ' ) . Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958 . It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects . The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970 . In recent years , several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD . Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA , Canada and Europe . The first study in this clinical development program , reported here , evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants . It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies . The study 's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28 ; these results will be presented later , once all the data has been analysed . Methods : This was a phase 1 , randomised , double‐blind , placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo , in healthy participants , conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry , Psychology and Neuroscience , London , UK . The following assessment tools were administered : Tellegen Absorption Scale ( TAS ) , NEO‐Five Factor Inventory ( NEO‐FFI ) , Symptom Checklist‐90 item ( SCL‐90 ) , Positive and Negative Affect Schedule ( PANAS ) , Pictorial Empathy Test ( PET ) , Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test ( RMET ) , Social Value Orientation ( SVO ) , Toronto Empathy Questionnaire ( TEQ ) , Scale of Social Responsibility ( SSR ) , Spatial Working Memory ( SWM ) , Rapid Visual Information Processing ( RVP ) , Paired Associates Learning ( PAL ) . Results from these instruments will be presented later . The study planned to recruit 90 participants , aged 18 plus , with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment . Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration . They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration , including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function . During this visit , they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist , lead therapist and chaperones . On Day 0 , participants stratified by sex and age ( 18‐35 years old ; > 35 years old ) were randomised to the study drug ( placebo , 10 mg psilocybin , or 25 mg psilocybin , administered orally , in a 1:1:1 ratio . ) . The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist . The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants . All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire ( 5D‐ASC ) . After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided , participants returned home , coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session , conducted by study therapists . Results : 89 participants were recruited , with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019 . Four strata were populated , ( males 18‐35 ) n = 24 ; ( males 35 + ) n = 24 ; ( females 18‐35 ) n = 23 ; ( females 35 + ) n = 18 . 38 % of the participants had prior psilocybin experience . A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed , with up to 6 participants per session ( 2 sessions with 1 participant , 3 with 2 participants , 5 with 3 participants , 11 with 4 , 2 with 5 , and , 2 ith 6 ) . In the simultaneous administration sessions , each participant was supported by an assisting therapist , overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist . During this study , 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies . Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences . The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported . Conclusions : This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists . Additionally , simultaneous administration to up to 6 volunteers was shown to be feasible in this population ."

0.44 mg / kg	8372	4 h after a single 0.44 mg / kg intravenous dose of ketamine or	"Ketamine improves short - term plasticity in depression by enhancing sensitivity to prediction errors.^ 
 Major depressive disorder negatively impacts the sensitivity and adaptability of the brain 's predictive coding framework . The current electroencephalography study into the antidepressant properties of ketamine investigated the downstream effects of ketamine on predictive coding and short - term plasticity in thirty patients with depression using the auditory roving mismatch negativity ( rMMN ) . The rMMN paradigm was run 3 - 4 h after a single 0.44 mg / kg intravenous dose of ketamine or active placebo ( remifentanil infused to a target plasma concentration of 1.7 ng / mL ) in order to measure the neural effects of ketamine in the period when an improvement in depressive symptoms emerges . Depression symptomatology was measured using the Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) ; 70 % of patients demonstrated at least a 50 % reduction their MADRS global score . Ketamine significantly increased the MMN and P3a event related potentials , directly contrasting literature demonstrating ketamine 's acute attenuation of the MMN . This effect was only reliable when all repetitions of the post - deviant tone were used . Dynamic causal modelling showed greater modulation of forward connectivity in response to a deviant tone between right primary auditory cortex and right inferior temporal cortex , which significantly correlated with antidepressant response to ketamine at 24 h. This is consistent with the hypothesis that ketamine increases sensitivity to unexpected sensory input and restores deficits in sensitivity to prediction error that are hypothesised to underlie depression . However , the lack of repetition suppression evident in the MMN evoked data compared to studies of healthy adults suggests that , at least within the short term , ketamine does not improve deficits in adaptive internal model calibration ."

 Background : 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA ) has been shown to reduce interpersonal defensiveness , but the neural mechanisms by which it promotes enhanced trust and openness are not well understood . Methods : In a novel , double‐blinded , randomized , cross‐over design , 17 healthy subjects aged 18 to 55 years ( mean=40.8 years , 62.5 % female ) received two doses of oral MDMA ( 120 mg or 80 mg ) , as well as placebo , 10 days apart . We used functional neuroimaging to assess key regions of the brain ’s negative affective circuit during implicit processing of social threat stimuli ∼90 minutes post‐drug administration and assessed participant experience using scales and free report at multiple time points . Results : Initial analyses showed a dose‐dependent decrease in activation of amygdala ( F=4.51 , p=0.02 , pFDR=0.04 ) and anterior insula ( F=15.6 , pFDR<0.001 ) in response to angry faces . This decrease was most pronounced for female compared to male participants ( amygdala , pFDR=0.007 ; anterior insula pFDR=0.04 ) . We observed accompanying dose‐dependent increases in wanting to be with others ( p=0.003 ) and feeling loving ( p=0.01 ) and empathetic and trusting ( p=0.01 ) . Illustrative free reports showed : “ I was feeling forgiveness and acceptance rather than just thinking it ” and “ I ’m feeling a deeper understanding of how trauma changes the brain ” . Conclusions : Our findings shed light on the neural circuit mechanisms by which MDMA may help modulate responses to social threat and , as a result , lower defensive reactions and promote a sense of trust and connection . These results make progress toward an understanding of the therapeutic mechanisms of MDMA in disorders characterized by threat reactivity and the neural targets that can be used in precision medicine trials .

 Introduction : It is a basic principle of the "" psychedelic "" treatment model that the quality of the acute experience mediates long - term improvements in mental health . In the present paper we sought to test this using data from a clinical trial assessing psilocybin for treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) . In line with previous reports , we hypothesized that the occurrence and magnitude of Oceanic Boundlessness ( OBN ) ( sharing features with mystical - type experience ) and Dread of Ego Dissolution ( DED ) ( similar to anxiety ) would predict long - term positive outcomes , whereas sensory perceptual effects would have negligible predictive value . Materials and Methods : Twenty patients with treatment resistant depression underwent treatment with psilocybin ( two separate sessions : 10 and 25 mg psilocybin ) . The Altered States of Consciousness ( ASC ) questionnaire was used to assess the quality of experiences in the 25 mg psilocybin session . From the ASC , the dimensions OBN and DED were used to measure the mystical - type and challenging experiences , respectively . The Self - Reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms ( QIDS - SR ) at 5 weeks served as the endpoint clinical outcome measure , as in later time points some of the subjects had gone on to receive new treatments , thus confounding inferences . In a repeated measure ANOVA , Time was the within - subject factor ( independent variable ) , with QIDS - SR as the within - subject dependent variable in baseline , 1 - day , 1 - week , 5 - weeks . OBN and DED were independent variables . OBN - by - Time and DED - by - Time interactions were the primary outcomes of interest . Results : For the interaction of OBN and DED with Time ( QIDS - SR as dependent variable ) , the main effect and the effects at each time point compared to baseline were all significant ( p = 0.002 and p = 0.003 , respectively , for main effects ) , confirming our main hypothesis . Furthermore , Pearson 's correlation of OBN with QIDS - SR ( 5 weeks ) was specific compared to perceptual dimensions of the ASC ( p < 0.05 ) . Discussion : This report further bolsters the view that the quality of the acute psychedelic experience is a key mediator of long - term changes in mental health .

.5mg / kg	1291	infusion ( single dose of .5mg / kg intravenous over 40minutes ) .	"Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment - resistant unipolar depression : a preliminary positron emission tomography study.^ 
 BACKGROUND : Multiple lines of evidence support a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder ( MDD ) . Ketamine , an N - methyl - D - aspartate antagonist , rapidly improves depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment - resistant depression . The neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown . METHODS : In this preliminary study , 20 unmedicated participants with treatment - resistant MDD underwent positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and following ketamine infusion ( single dose of .5mg / kg intravenous over 40minutes ) . Metabolic data were compared between conditions using a combination of region - of - interest and voxelwise analyses , and differences were correlated with the associated antidepressant response . RESULTS : Whole - brain metabolism did not change significantly following ketamine . Regional metabolism decreased significantly under ketamine in the habenula , insula , and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the right hemisphere . Metabolism increased postketamine in bilateral occipital , right sensorimotor , left parahippocampal , and left inferior parietal cortices . Improvement in depression ratings correlated directly with change in metabolism in right superior and middle temporal gyri . Conversely , clinical improvement correlated inversely with metabolic changes in right parahippocampal gyrus and temporoparietal cortex . CONCLUSIONS : Although preliminary , these results indicate that treatment - resistant MDD subjects showed decreased metabolism in the right habenula and the extended medial and orbital prefrontal networks in association with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine . Conversely , metabolism increased in sensory association cortices , conceivably related to the illusory phenomena sometimes experienced with ketamine . Further studies are needed to elucidate how these functional anatomical changes relate to the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine 's rapid antidepressant effects ."

 BACKGROUND : Clinical trials have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects with intravenous ( IV ) ketamine for major depressive disorder , with relatively less research specifically for bipolar depression . Herein , we describe the real - world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment - resistant bipolar depression . METHODS : This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga , Ontario ( Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence ; Braxia Health ) . In this observational study ( NCT04209296 ) , patients with treatment - resistant bipolar I / II depression ( n = 66 ) received four sub - anesthetic doses of IV ketamine ( 0.5 - 0.75 mg / kg ) over a two - week period . Symptoms of depression , suicidality , anxiety , and functioning were assessed with validated self - report measures . RESULTS : Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample , as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology - Self Report-16 ( QIDS - SR(16 ) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion ( n = 66 ; mean QIDS - SR(16 ) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39 ; p < 0.0001 ) . Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts ( QIDS - SR(16 ) -Suicide Item ) and anxiety ( Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 ) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale ( p < 0.0001 on all measures ) . Moreover , the response rate ( QIDS - SR(16 ) total score decrease ≥50 % from baseline ) was 35 % and remission rate ( QIDS - SR(16 ) total score ≤5 ) was 20 % after four infusions . Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment - emergent hypomania observed in only three patients ( 4.5 % ) with zero cases of mania or psychosis . CONCLUSIONS : Real - world effectiveness of IV ketamine for bipolar depression was observed . Repeated doses were associated with greater symptom reduction and adequate tolerability ."
5 , 10 , and 20 mcg	3766	three different LSD microdoses ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg , p.o . ) compared	"P.323 Cognitive and subjective effects of different low ‘ micro ’ doses of LSD in a placebo - controlled study.^ 
 Background : Since a decade , there has been an increased interest in the practice of microdosing with psychedelics such as LSD , among healthy and patient populations [ 1,2 ] . A microdose is by definition sub‐perceptual , suggested to be one tenth of a ‘ regular dose ’ and used according to a repeated dosing schedule to enhance mood and/or cognitive performance [ 3 ] . However , users indicate that they do not know the exact dose they actually consume to experience aforementioned effects [ 2 ] . Aim : The primary objective was to determine the effective dose which changes mood and cognition . Methods : A placebo‐controlled , randomized within‐subjects study including 24 healthy recreational drug users ( 12 males , 12 females ) was set up to test the acute effects of three different LSD microdoses ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg , p.o . ) compared to placebo on measures of cognition , mood , and subjective experience up to 6 hours after administration . Cognitive performance was assessed at 2 and 4 hours post‐drug and included measures of attention ( Psychomotor Vigilance Task ( PVT ) ) and set‐shifting ( Digit Symbol Substitution Task ( DSST ) ) . Mood changes were measured five times per test day ( Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) ) ; subjective drug effects ( Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) ) were measured ten times , and psychedelic experience was measured at the end of each test day ( 5‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale ( 5D‐ASC ) ) . Statistics : Data was analysed by means of a General Linear Model Univariate Analysis of Variance with Drug ( 4 levels ) and Time as fixed factors , and Participant ( PPNR ) as a random factor . The model was customized to examine 3 main effects ( Drug , Time and PPNR ) , and two interaction effects of Drug x Time , and Drug x PPNR . For the 5D‐ASC , no Time effect was included . Results : The highest dose ( 20 mcg ) significantly improved attention in the PVT ( Number of Lapses : p < 0.01 ; Reaction Time : p= 0.03 ) and increased self‐rated mood in the POMS ( positive mood , p < 0.01 ) and VAS ( happiness , p < 0.01 ) while impairing performance in shifting task ( DSST , p < 0.01 ) and decreasing self‐rated levels on the VAS of concentration ( p < 0.01 ) and productivity ( p < 0.01 ) compared to placebo . The intermediate dose ( 10 mcg ) increased the feeling of productivity ( p= 0.03 ) . Participants noticed they were under the influence of LSD after the high and intermediate dose ( p < 0.01 ) and an increase in psychedelic state was experienced ( p < 0.01 ) . Furthermore , results showed a significant interaction of Drug x PPNR on the PVT , DSST , POMS , and VAS , indicating individual differences in response to the different doses . Conclusion : While findings show that a single LSD dose ( 20 mcg ) acutely enhances subjective ( mood ) effects and attention , more complex cognitive performance is impaired and perceptual ‘ hallucinogenic ’ effects are experienced , though the latter are negligible when compared to full LSD doses . Future studies need to establish whether these effects on cognition and mood persist beyond the acute stage and whether they change after repeated administration . In addition , future studies should investigate what distinguishes one person from another in their response to a microdose of LSD .

20 mcg	3766	: The highest dose ( 20 mcg ) significantly improved attention in	"P.323 Cognitive and subjective effects of different low ‘ micro ’ doses of LSD in a placebo - controlled study.^ 
 Background : Since a decade , there has been an increased interest in the practice of microdosing with psychedelics such as LSD , among healthy and patient populations [ 1,2 ] . A microdose is by definition sub‐perceptual , suggested to be one tenth of a ‘ regular dose ’ and used according to a repeated dosing schedule to enhance mood and/or cognitive performance [ 3 ] . However , users indicate that they do not know the exact dose they actually consume to experience aforementioned effects [ 2 ] . Aim : The primary objective was to determine the effective dose which changes mood and cognition . Methods : A placebo‐controlled , randomized within‐subjects study including 24 healthy recreational drug users ( 12 males , 12 females ) was set up to test the acute effects of three different LSD microdoses ( 5 , 10 , and 20 mcg , p.o . ) compared to placebo on measures of cognition , mood , and subjective experience up to 6 hours after administration . Cognitive performance was assessed at 2 and 4 hours post‐drug and included measures of attention ( Psychomotor Vigilance Task ( PVT ) ) and set‐shifting ( Digit Symbol Substitution Task ( DSST ) ) . Mood changes were measured five times per test day ( Profile of Mood States ( POMS ) ) ; subjective drug effects ( Visual Analogue Scales ( VAS ) ) were measured ten times , and psychedelic experience was measured at the end of each test day ( 5‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale ( 5D‐ASC ) ) . Statistics : Data was analysed by means of a General Linear Model Univariate Analysis of Variance with Drug ( 4 levels ) and Time as fixed factors , and Participant ( PPNR ) as a random factor . The model was customized to examine 3 main effects ( Drug , Time and PPNR ) , and two interaction effects of Drug x Time , and Drug x PPNR . For the 5D‐ASC , no Time effect was included . Results : The highest dose ( 20 mcg ) significantly improved attention in the PVT ( Number of Lapses : p < 0.01 ; Reaction Time : p= 0.03 ) and increased self‐rated mood in the POMS ( positive mood , p < 0.01 ) and VAS ( happiness , p < 0.01 ) while impairing performance in shifting task ( DSST , p < 0.01 ) and decreasing self‐rated levels on the VAS of concentration ( p < 0.01 ) and productivity ( p < 0.01 ) compared to placebo .

 Salvinorin A is a potent , selective nonnitrogenous kappa opioid agonist and the known psychoactive constituent of Salvia divinorum , a member of the mint family that has been used for centuries by Mazatec shamans of Mexico for divination and spiritual healing . S. divinorum has over the last several years gained increased popularity as a recreational drug . This is a double - blind , placebo controlled study of salvinorin A in 4 psychologically and physically healthy hallucinogen - using adults . Across sessions , participants inhaled 16 ascending doses of salvinorin A and 4 intermixed placebo doses under comfortable and supportive conditions . Doses ranged from 0.375 μg / kg to 21 μg / kg . Subject - rated drug strength was assessed every 2 min for 60 min after inhalation . Orderly time- and dose - related effects were observed . Drug strength ratings peaked at 2 min ( first time point ) and definite subjective effects were no longer present at approximately 20 min after inhalation . Dose - related increases were observed on questionnaire measures of mystical - type experience ( Mysticism Scale ) and subjective effects associated with classic serotonergic ( 5 - HT2(A ) ) hallucinogens ( Hallucinogen Rating Scale ) . Salvinorin A did not significantly increase heart rate or blood pressure . Participant narratives indicated intense experiences characterized by disruptions in vestibular and interoceptive signals ( e.g. , change in spatial orientation , pressure on the body ) and unusual and sometimes recurring themes across sessions such as revisiting childhood memories , cartoon - like imagery , and contact with entities .

OBJECTIVES : Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples . We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects . METHODS : We conducted a pooled analysis of four double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single - dose administrations of LSD . LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies . Single doses were 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 µg of LSD base . We investigated subjective effects ( self - rated any drug effect , good drug effect , bad drug effect , and anxiety ) , blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature , duration of the acute LSD response , acute ( 12 h ) and subacute ( 24 h ) adverse effects , reports of flashbacks , and liver and kidney function before and after the studies . RESULTS : LSD dose - dependently increased subjective , physiologic , and adverse effects . The dose - response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects . Maximal ratings of > 50 % good drug effects were reached in 37 % , 91 % , 96 % , and 91 % of the LSD administrations at 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 µg . Maximal ratings of > 50 % bad drug effects were reached in 0 % , 9 % , 27 % , 31 % at 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 µg , respectively .

OBJECTIVES : Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples . We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects . METHODS : We conducted a pooled analysis of four double - blind , randomized , placebo - controlled , crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single - dose administrations of LSD . LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies . Single doses were 25 , 50 , 100 , and 200 µg of LSD base . We investigated subjective effects ( self - rated any drug effect , good drug effect , bad drug effect , and anxiety ) , blood pressure , heart rate , body temperature , duration of the acute LSD response , acute ( 12 h ) and subacute ( 24 h ) adverse effects , reports of flashbacks , and liver and kidney function before and after the studies . RESULTS : LSD dose - dependently increased subjective , physiologic , and adverse effects . The dose - response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects .

 OBJECTIVES : Research studies have reported impressive antidepressant effects with ketamine but significant knowledge gaps remain over the best method of administering ketamine , and the relationships between dose , antidepressant response and adverse effects . METHODS : In this pilot dose - finding study , the efficacy and tolerability of ketamine given by rapid intravenous ( i.v . ) infusion were assessed in a double - blind , placebo - controlled , crossover design , in four subjects with treatment- resistant depression . Each subject received up to four i.v . doses of ketamine ( 0.1 , 0.2 , 0.3 , 0.4 mg / kg ) , given over 2 - 5 min , 1 week apart , and one randomly inserted placebo treatment . RESULTS : Three of four subjects achieved antidepressant response ( ≥ 50 % decrease in Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores ) , two at the minimum 0.1 mg / kg dose , though all relapsed within a week . For two subjects , the greatest improvement occurred at the highest dose received . Rapid infusion over 2 min led to significant adverse psychotomimetic effects which also increased proportionately with ketamine dosage . CONCLUSIONS : This is the first trial to present dose - response data of ketamine efficacy and psychomimetic effects in depressed subjects . Antidepressant efficacy may be dose - related .

 Ketamine has rapid - acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects ( SEs ) . Recent studies noted a positive correlation between treatment response to ketamine and general dissociative SEs , as well as "" floating "" , a depersonalization SE ( a subtype of the dissociative SEs ) . This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine . Data were pooled from three double - blind , crossover , placebo - controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment - resistant depression ( TRD ) ( 44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder ) received placebo and ketamine ( 0.5 mg / kg ) infusions . SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion . The hypothesis that a post - infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post - infusion and at Day 1 . Montgomery - Asberg Depression Rating Scale ( MADRS ) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model . Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores ( p < 0.0001 ) , but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post - infusion . The hypothesized mediation effect of floating was also not detected at either 230 min or Day 1 post - infusion . Taken together , the findings do not support the hypothesis that ketamine 's antidepressant effects are mediated by the dissociative depersonalization subtype SE of floating ."

 BACKGROUND : The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics . However , its time - dependent systems - level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans . METHODS : We conducted a double - blind , randomized , counterbalanced , crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg / kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days . Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects : 20 minutes , 40 minutes , and 70 minutes after administration . Resting - state functional connectivity was quantified via a data - driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps . RESULTS : Psilocybin reduced associative , but concurrently increased sensory , brain - wide connectivity . This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects . Furthermore , we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin - induced changes in functional connectivity . Lastly , psilocybin - induced changes correlated in a time - dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5 - HT(2A ) ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine 2A ) and 5 - HT(1A ) ( 5 - hydroxytryptamine 1A ) receptors . CONCLUSIONS : These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems . Furthermore , baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment ."

METHODS : Up to three participants were administered LSD on the same day in separate rooms , each with a single attendant , after 1 day of preparation . An open - label design and a double - blind placebo - controlled design were used . RESULTS : Ninety - one percent of participants completed the study . Thirty - two adults ( mean age = 28.8 years ) received 50 ( n = 3 ) , 75 ( n = 7 ) , 100 ( n = 3 ) LSD , 50 µg followed by 75 µg LSD ( n = 9 ) 1 week apart , or placebo followed by a 75 µg LSD ( n = 10 ) 1 week apart . There were no serious adverse events . Twenty - eight percent of participants experienced at least one expected mild adverse event , with one expected moderate adverse event . The maximum blood plasma levels occurred between 1.2 and 2 h post - administration , with an apparent half - life between 2.8 and 4.3 h. LSD largely induced greater subjective effects versus placebo . CONCLUSION : In the current novel intervention paradigm , 50 , 75 , and 100 µg LSD are tolerable with favourable safety profiles in healthy adults , only mild adverse events during the day of drug administration , and mystical - type subjective experiences . Future studies are needed to evaluate safety , tolerability , subjective effects , and cost - effectiveness in clinical populations ."
