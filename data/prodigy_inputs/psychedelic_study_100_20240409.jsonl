Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 \u03bcg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h. Urine was collected during 3 time intervals (0\u20138, 8\u201316 and 16\u201324 h after LSD administration). Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modelling. Concentration\u2013subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic modelling. Results: Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 1.8 ng/mL (1.6\u20132.0) and 3.4 ng/mL (3.0\u20133.8) after the administration of 85 and 170 \u03bcg LSD, respectively. Maximal concentrations were achieved on average after 1.7 h. Elimination half-lives were 3.7 h (3.4\u20134.1) and 4.0 h (3.6\u20134.4), for 85 and 170 \u03bcg LSD, respectively. Only 1% of the administered dose was recovered from urine unchanged within the first 24 h, 16% was eliminated as 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD. Urinary recovery was dose proportional. Mean (\u00b1standard deviation) durations of subjective effects were 9.3 \u00b1 3.2 and 11 \u00b1 3.7 h, and maximal effects (any drug effects) were 77 \u00b1 18% and 87 \u00b1 13% after 85 and 170 \u03bcg of LSD, respectively. Conclusion: The present novel study validates previous findings. LSD exhibited dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination kinetics and dose-dependent duration and intensity of subjective effects.

As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5\u03bcg, 13\u03bcg, or 26\u03bcg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection.

Herein, we describe the real-world effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions for treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHODS: This study was conducted in a community clinic in Mississauga, Ontario (Canadian Rapid Treatment Centre of Excellence; Braxia Health). In this observational study (NCT04209296), patients with treatment-resistant bipolar I/II depression (n\u00a0=\u00a066) received four sub-anesthetic doses of IV ketamine (0.5-0.75\u2009mg/kg) over a two-week period. Symptoms of depression, suicidality, anxiety, and functioning were assessed with validated self-report measures. RESULTS: Statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects were observed in the overall sample, as measured by the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16) ) with further reductions in depressive symptoms observed after each subsequent infusion (n\u00a0=\u00a066; mean QIDS-SR(16) reduction of 6.08+/-1.39; p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts (QIDS-SR(16) -Suicide Item) and anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7) were also observed with functional improvements on the Sheehan Disability Scale (p\u2009<\u20090.0001 on all measures). Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score decrease \u226550% from baseline) was 35% and remission rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score \u22645) was 20% after four infusions. Infusions were generally well tolerated with treatment-emergent hypomania observed in only three patients (4.5%) with zero cases of mania or psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: Real-world effectiveness of IV ketamine for bipolar depression was observed.

A comparison was made between the suicide-attempting adolescent inpatients and the non-attempting subjects, by the use of specific types of substances, measurements of psychotic, depressive, and aggressive symptoms, and clinical data reported during their hospitalization. Results: The suicide attempters reported considerably greater usage of inhalants and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD).

Objectives: We examined whether change in ecstasy use was associated with change in depressive symptoms/probable depression over a 4-year period, among a large Australian sample. Methods: The Personality and Total Health project is a longitudinal general community study of Australians from Canberra and Queanbeyan. Data from the youngest cohort when aged 24-30 (N = 2, 128) and 4 years later (N = 1, 977) was included. The Goldberg depression scale and the Brief Patient Health Questionnaire measured depressive symptoms and probable depression, respectively. Multilevel growth models also considered demographics, psychosocial characteristics, and other drug use. Results: Ecstasy use was not associated with long-term depressive symptoms or greater odds of depression in multivariate analyses. Users had more self-reported depressive symptoms when using ecstasy compared to not using. However, differences between people who had and had not ever used ecstasy largely accounted for this. Other factors were more important in the prediction of depression. Conclusions: It would be premature to conclude that ecstasy use is not related to the development of long-term depressive symptoms, given the relatively low level of ecstasy and other drug use in this community sample.

In this study, the authors investigate ketamine's effects on suicidality in a real-world sample of recent suicide attempters on a tertiary-care Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Using an open-label design, 16 transdiagnostic CL patients were recruited, 18-65 years old, to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post-infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures were compared to ratings taken at 24 h, 5 days, 12 days, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-infusion using paired t-tests. Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p's < 0.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen's d's: 1.7-8.8) at acute timepoints (24 h; 5 days). These gains were uniformly maintained to 6 months post-infusion. Open-label ketamine appeared to rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra-high-risk, heterogeneous, real-world sample. Ketamine infusion may therefore be a safe, feasible, viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among medically hospitalized patients after a suicide attempt, with potentially enduring benefits.

Experimental studies implicate deficient N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptor functioning in such abnormalities. OBJECTIVES: The primary aim of this study was to investigate the effects of the cannabinoid CB(1) receptor antagonist rimonabant on MMN deficits in the NMDA receptor antagonist model of schizophrenia by using ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy male subjects participated in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled cross-over study with subanesthetic doses of intravenous ketamine. The MMNs to frequency and duration deviants were elicited within an auditory oddball paradigm and recorded by a 32-channel EEG. Psychopathology was assessed using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory. RESULTS: Twenty subjects completed both experimental sessions. Ketamine infusion had no significant effect on MMN amplitudes in both deviance conditions. In contrast to placebo, co-administration of rimonabant produced significant deficits in MMN amplitudes to duration deviants at electrode position Fz. CONCLUSIONS: The results point to the involvement of the endogenous cannabinoid system in auditory sensory memory as a cognitive key feature in schizophrenia.

Methods: 105 poly-drug consumers with former Ecstasy use and 41 persons with comparable drug history without Ecstasy use, and 11 drug naives were investigated for EEG features. Conventional EEG derivations of 19 electrodes according to the 10-20-system were conducted. Besides standard EEG bands, quantitative EEG analyses of 1-Hz-subdivided power ranges of Alpha, Theta and Beta bands have been considered. Results: Ecstasy users with medium and high cumulative Ecstasy doses revealed an increase in Theta and lower Alpha activities, significant increases in Beta activities, and a reduction of background activity. Ecstasy users with low cumulative Ecstasy doses showed a significant Alpha activity at 11 Hz. Interestingly, the spectral power of low frequencies in medium and high Ecstasy users was already significantly increased in the early phase of EEG recording. Statistical analyses suggested the main effect of Ecstasy to EEG results. Conclusions: Our data from a major sample of Ecstasy users support previous data revealing alterations of EEG frequency spectrum due rather to neurotoxic effects of Ecstasy on serotonergic systems in more detail. Accordingly, our data may be in line with the observation of attentional and memory impairments in Ecstasy users with moderate to high misuse. Despite the methodological problem of polydrug use also in our approach, our EEG results may be indicative of the neuropathophysiological background of the reported memory and attentional deficits in Ecstasy abusers. Overall, our findings may suggest the usefulness of EEG in diagnostic approaches in assessing neurotoxic sequela of this common drug abuse. \u00a9 2010 Adamaszek et al.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0014097", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21124854/", "secondary_title": "PLoS ONE"}

Method To be included, peer-reviewed articles had to be written in English or Spanish and had to address the usage of psychedelics by people reporting an ED. Searches were conducted on PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. Data on key study characteristics and the findings from the studies were charted using a standardised form. Two reviewers independently charted the data from the included articles. Quality appraisal was conducted for all included studies. Results Six studies reporting the use of ayahuasca, DMT/5-MEO-DMT, LSD/1P-LSD, San Pedro/mescaline, psilocybin, and ketamine were included. After the psychedelic experiences, many participants reported diminished ED symptoms, reductions in anxiety, self-harm, suicidality, and problematic substance use, significant improvements in depression and wellbeing, and changes in self-perception, and some showed complete remission. Several participants felt profound spiritual healing and reported achieving deep insights into the psychological origins of their ED. All the qualitative studies met 100% of the quality appraisal criteria, whereas the quantitative studies were rated from between 20% and 60%. Discussion All included studies suggest that psychedelics promise therapeutic value for eating disorders. These findings are preliminary, and randomised controlled trials are necessary to prove psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy efficacy and long-term implications for eating disorders. Major changes in drug policy are urgent to facilitate research about psychedelics. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04661514.

However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 \u00b1 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 \u00b1 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (\u2265 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population.

METHODS: In our study, a group of 18 healthy male volunteers was tested in prepulse inhibition (PPI) and P50 evoked potential paradigms during placebo-placebo, placebo-ketamine (.3 mg/kg; intravenous), and 2-mg haloperidol/.3 mg/kg intravenous ketamine conditions. RESULTS: Suppression of PPI and P50 in the ketamine condition did not differ from either the placebo-placebo or the haloperidol-ketamine condition; however, a significant reduction in percentage PPI to the lowest prepulse intensity and a reduction of P50 suppression were found in the haloperidol-ketamine condition. CONCLUSIONS: The combination of haloperidol and ketamine was found to disrupt P50 suppression and PPI in healthy male volunteers, whereas ketamine alone did not affect either measure.

Low serotonin may make them susceptible to lowered mood. OBJECTIVE: This work aims to study the acute effects on mood and impulsivity of lowering serotonin levels with acute tryptophan depletion in polydrug ecstasy users and to determine whether effects were different in men and women. METHODS: In a double-blind cross-over study, participants who had used ecstasy at least 25 times (n\u2009=\u200913) and nonuser controls (n\u2009=\u200917) received a tryptophan-deficient amino acid mixture and a control amino acid mixture containing tryptophan, at least 1 week apart. Mood was measured using the profile of mood states, and impulsivity was measured with the Go/No-Go task. RESULTS: The main result shows that a lowering of mood after acute tryptophan depletion occurred only in female polydrug ecstasy users (n\u2009=\u20097), relative to controls (n\u2009=\u20099). Results from the Go/No-Go task suggested that impulsivity was not increased by acute tryptophan depletion in polydrug ecstasy users. LIMITATION: The group sizes were small, when males and females were considered separately.

Ketamine, originally an anesthetic, has been shown anti-suicide effects in clinical trials designed to treat depression. However, changes at the biochemical level were assessed only in protocols of ketamine with very limited sample sizes, particularly when the subcutaneous route was considered. In addition, the inflammatory changes associated with ketamine effects and their correlation with response to treatment, dose-effect, and suicide risk warrant further investigation. Therefore, we aimed to assess whether ketamine results in better control of suicidal ideation and/or behavior in patients with depressive episodes and whether ketamine affects psychopathology and inflammatory biomarkers. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We report here the design of a naturalistic prospective multicenter study protocol of ketamine in depressive episodes carried out at Hospital de Cl\u00ednicas de Porto Alegre (HCPA) and Hospital Moinhos de Vento (HMV). The study was planned to recruit adult patients with Major depressive disorder (MDD) or Bipolar disorder (BD) types 1 or 2, who are currently in a depressive episode and show symptoms of suicidal ideation and/or behavior according to the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) and have been prescribed ketamine by their assistant psychiatrist. Patients receive ketamine subcutaneously (SC) twice a week for 1 month, but the frequency can be changed or the dose decreased according to the assistant physician's decision. After the last ketamine session, patients are followed-up via telephone once a month for up to 6 months. The data will be analyzed using repeated measures statistics to evaluate the reduction in suicide risk as a primary outcome, as per C-SSRS. DISCUSSION: We discuss the need for studies with longer follow-ups designed to measure a direct impact on suicide risk and that additional information about the safety and tolerability of ketamine in particular subset of patients such as those with depression and ideation suicide.

Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples\u2019 experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00\u20131.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00\u20134.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85\u20130.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience.

However, pharmacological interaction experiments, such as the modulation of one drug response in the presence of another, have not been widely investigated using a task-free ASL approach. Objectives: We assessed the effects of three psychoactive compounds (ketamine, risperidone and lamotrigine), and their interaction, on resting brain perfusion in healthy human volunteers. Methods: A multivariate Gaussian process classification (GPC) and more conventional univariate analyses were applied. The four pre-infusion conditions for each subject comprised risperidone, lamotrigine and two placebo sessions. The two placebo conditions enabled us to evaluate the classification performance in a test-retest setting, in addition to its performance in distinguishing the active oral drugs from placebo (direct effect on brain perfusion). The post ketamine- or saline-infusion scans allowed the effect of ketamine, and its interaction with risperidone and lamotrigine, on brain perfusion to be characterised. Results: The pseudo-continuous ASL measurements of perfusion were sensitive to the effects of ketamine infusion and risperidone. The GPC captured consistent changes in perfusion across the group and contextualised the univariate changes with a larger pattern of regions contributing to accurate discrimination of ketamine from placebo. Conclusions: The findings argue against perfusion changes confounding in the previously described evoked BOLD response to ketamine and emphasise the blockade of the NMDA receptor over neuronal glutamate release in determining the perfusion changes induced by ketamine.

Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). \u00a9 2009 ElsevierEspa\u00f1a, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados.", "doi": "10.1016/j.rce.2010.01.013", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20673888/", "secondary_title": "Revista Clinica Espanola"}

Evidence suggesting cognitive benefits from nicotine administration, together with the high rate of cigarette use in patients with schizophrenia, has stimulated interest in whether nicotine modulates NMDAR hypofunction. We examined the interactive effects of ketamine, an NMDAR antagonist that produces transient schizophrenia-like neurophysiological effects, and nicotine, a nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) agonist, in 30 healthy volunteers to determine whether nicotine prevents or attenuates MMN abnormalities. Secondary analyses compared the profile of ketamine and schizophrenia effects on MMN using previously reported data from 24 schizophrenia patients (Hay et al. 2015). Healthy volunteers completed four test days, during which they received ketamine/placebo and nicotine/placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced design. MMN to intensity, frequency, duration, and frequency+duration double deviant sounds was assessed each day. Ketamine decreased intensity, frequency, and double deviant MMN amplitudes, whereas nicotine increased intensity and double deviant MMN amplitudes. A ketamine\u00d7nicotine interaction indicated, however, that nicotine failed to attenuate the decrease in MMN associated with ketamine. Although the present dose of ketamine produced smaller decrements in MMN than those associated with schizophrenia, the profile of effects across deviant types did not differ between ketamine and schizophrenia.

However, there is no rapid-acting treatment to address these symptoms during a limited hospital stay. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a single-center, randomized, placebo-controlled, and double-blind trial. Randomization will be applied and stratified by the severity of PDS (moderate versus severe). Eighty patients who are scheduled for elective supratentorial brain tumor resection with PDS will be randomly allocated to the ketamine or placebo group with a ratio of 1 to 1. Patients in the ketamine group will be administered low-dose ketamine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) intravenously for 40\u00a0min while the dural mater is being cut into, whereas patients in the placebo group will receive the same volume of normal saline at the same infusion rate at the same time points. The primary endpoint is the rate of PDS response at 3 days after surgery. Secondary outcomes include efficacy parameters such as the rate of PDS remission and safety outcomes such as the incidence of postoperative delirium, quality of recovery, and psychiatric side effects.

Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13\u2009mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3\u2009g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)).

A vigilance test was conducted once, at 5 A.M.,: and a sleepiness scale was presented to the subjects ten times throughout the evening and night. RESULTS: MDMA impaired tracking performance in a simple tracking task. Divided attention task performance was also impaired as indicated by a decrease in secondary task performance under the influence of MDMA compared with placebo. MDMA did not affect impulsivity measures. Vigilance performance decreased as a function of time on task, but this decrement was less during MDMA treatment compared to placebo. After the administration of MDMA, the sleepiness scale scores were lower during the night when compared with placebo. This difference between MDMA and placebo disappeared in the morning.

The objective of this study was to investigate whether in humans, like previous observations made in animals, the effects of MDMA on the 5-HT system are dependent on age-of-first exposure. Methods: 5-HT transporter (SERT) densities in the frontal cortex and midbrain were assessed with [123I]\u03b2-CIT single photon emission computed tomography in 33 users of ecstasy. Subjects were stratified for early-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 14-18 years; developing brain), and late-exposed users (age-at-first exposure 18-36 years; mature brain). In parallel, we investigated the effects of age experimentally with MDMA in early-exposed (adolescent) rats and late-exposed (adult) rats using the same radioligand. Results: On average, five years after first exposure, we found a strong inverse relationship, wherein age-at-first exposure predicted 79% of the midbrain SERT variability in early (developing brain) exposed ecstasy users, whereas this was only 0.3% in late (mature brain) exposed users (p = 0.007). No such effect was observed in the frontal cortex. In rats, a significant age-BY-treatment effect (p<0.01) was observed as well, however only in the frontal cortex. Conclusions: These age-related effects most likely reflect differences in the maturational stage of the 5-HT projection fields at age-at-first exposure and enhanced outgrowth of the 5-HT system due to 5-HT's neurotrophic effects. Ultimately, our findings stress the need for more knowledge on the effects of pharmacotherapies that alter brain 5-HT levels in the pediatric population. \u00a9 2012 Klomp et al.", "doi": "10.1371/journal.pone.0047524", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23115651/", "secondary_title": "PLoS ONE"}

Recent evidence from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) supports the rapid antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression. The aim of this study was to explore the effect of ayahuasca on plasma cortisol and awakening salivary cortisol response, in the same group of treatment-resistant patients (MD) and in healthy volunteers (C). Subjects received a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo (dosing session), and both plasma and awakening salivary cortisol response were measured at baseline (before dosing session) and 48 h after the dosing session. Baseline assessment (D0) showed blunted awakening salivary cortisol response and hypocortisolemia in patients, with respect to healthy controls. Salivary cortisol was also measured during dosing session, and we observed higher increases for both C and MD that ingested ayahuasca than placebo. After 48 h from the dosing session with ayahuasca, patients' awakening salivary cortisol response is similar to the ones detected in controls. No significant changes in plasma cortisol levels were observed 48 h after the sessions. Therefore, these findings point to new evidence on the modulation of salivary cortisol levels as a result of an ayahuasca session, both in healthy and depressive volunteers. Considering that cortisol acts in regulation of distinct physiological pathways, emotional and cognitive processes, it is assumed to be critically involved to the etiology of depression and its regulation seems to be important for the treatment and remission of major depression, ayahuasca use as antidepressant should be further investigated.

However, little is known about its long-term impact on trauma patients. We aimed to assess the long-term functional, mental, and psychosocial outcomes of PDU in trauma patients 6 to 12 months after injury. METHODS: Trauma patients with moderate to severe injuries (Injury Severity Score, >9) who had a toxicology screen upon admission to one of three level 1 trauma centers were contacted by phone 6 to 12 months postinjury. Psychoactive drug use was defined as the presence of a psychoactive, nonprescribed substance on toxicology screen including amphetamine, barbiturate, benzodiazepine, cannabinoid, methamphetamine, methadone, opioid, oxycodone, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy), phencyclidine, tricyclic antidepressant, and cocaine. The interviews systematically evaluated functional limitations, social functioning, chronic pain, and mental health (posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, anxiety). Patients with a score of \u226447 on the Short-Form Health Survey version 2.0 social functioning subdomain were considered to have social dysfunction. Multivariable regression models were built to determine the independent association between PDU and long-term outcomes. RESULTS: Of the 1,699 eligible patients, 571 (34%) were included in the analysis, and 173 (30.3%) screened positive for PDU on admission. Patients with PDU were younger (median age [interquartile range], 43 [28-55] years vs. 66 [46-78] years, p < 0.001), had more penetrating injuries (8.7% vs. 4.3%, p = 0.036), and were less likely to have received a college education (41.3% vs. 54.5%, p = 0.004). After adjusting for patients' characteristics including the presence of a baseline psychiatric comorbidity, patients with PDU on admission were more likely to suffer from daily chronic pain, mental health disorders, and social dysfunction 6 to 12 months after injury. There was no difference in the functional limitations between patients with and without PDU. CONCLUSION: On the long term, PDU in trauma patients is strongly and independently associated with worse mental health, more chronic pain, and severe impairment in social functioning. A trauma hospitalization presents an opportunity to identify patients at risk and to mitigate the long-term impact of PDU on recovery.

In light of recent evidence suggesting a significant impact of the glutamatergic system on key symptoms of schizophrenia, we assessed whether modulation of the glutamatergic system via blockage of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor might lead to changes of thalamic functional connectivity. METHODS: Based on the ketamine model of psychosis, we investigated changes in cortico-thalamic functional connectivity by intravenous ketamine challenge during a 55-minute resting-state scan. Thirty healthy volunteers were measured with pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. RESULTS: Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant ketamine-specific changes within the thalamus hub network, more precisely, an increase of cortico-thalamic connectivity of the somatosensory and temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that changes of thalamic functioning as described for schizophrenia can be partly mimicked by NMDA-receptor blockage.

In a comprehensive, within-subjects, placebo-controlled design, we acquired multimodal neuroimaging [i.e., EEG-fMRI\u00a0(electroencephalography-functional MRI)] data to assess the effects of intravenous (IV) N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) on brain function in 20 healthy volunteers. Simultaneous EEG-fMRI was acquired prior to, during, and after a bolus IV administration of 20 mg DMT, and, separately, placebo. At dosages consistent with the present study, DMT, a serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2AR) agonist, induces a deeply immersive and radically altered state of consciousness. DMT is thus a useful research tool for probing the neural correlates of conscious experience. Here, fMRI results revealed robust increases in global functional connectivity (GFC), network disintegration and desegregation, and a compression of the principal cortical gradient under DMT. GFC \u00d7 subjective intensity maps correlated with independent positron emission tomography (PET)-derived 5-HT2AR maps, and both overlapped with meta-analytical data implying human-specific psychological functions. Changes in major EEG-measured neurophysiological properties correlated with specific changes in various fMRI metrics, enriching our understanding of the neural basis of DMT's effects. The present findings advance on previous work by confirming a predominant action of DMT-and likely other 5-HT2AR agonist psychedelics-on the brain's transmodal association pole, i.e., the neurodevelopmentally and evolutionarily recent cortex that is associated with species-specific psychological advancements, and high expression of 5-HT2A receptors.", "doi": "10.1073/pnas.2218949120", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36940333/", "secondary_title": "Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A"}

The aim of the present study was to investigate the incidence of self-reported depression and associated help-seeking among a sample of regular ecstasy users. A further aim was to examine the correlates of depressive symptomatology in this population. Materials and Methods: 100 regular ecstasy consumers (at least monthly use) were interviewed as part of the Ecstasy and Related Drug Reporting System in Tasmania, Australia. Participants were also administered epidemiological measures of depression (Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale) and psychological distress (Kessler Psychological Distress Scale). Results: One quarter (23%) of participants self-reported recent experience of depression, a rate notably greater than the general population. However, only one third of these participants had attended a health professional for this issue. A range of drug use factors (e.g. frequency and quantity of ecstasy use, frequent cannabis or methamphetamine use, intravenous drug use, polydrug use, binge drug use, harmful alcohol use, and elevated psychological dependence scores for ecstasy and methamphetamine) were associated with high levels of depressive symptomatology. Conclusion: These findings are consistent with an association between depressive symptomatology and ecstasy and other drug use. Harm reduction strategies which target drug use factors such as those identified in this study may also aid in the reduction of the experience of depression. Considering the low levels of help-seeking among this population, improving awareness and access to information and treatment for depression may also be important. Copyright \u00a9 2010 S.

RESULTS: The systematic review indicated significant short- and long-term reduction of depressive symptoms in all conditions studied after administration of psilocybin, ayahuasca, or LSD, with psychological support.

The 200\u2009\u00b5g dose of LSD increased only ratings of ineffability significantly more than 30\u2009mg psilocybin. LSD at both doses had clearly longer effect durations than psilocybin. Psilocybin increased blood pressure more than LSD, whereas LSD increased heart rate more than psilocybin. However, both LSD and psilocybin showed comparable cardiostimulant properties, assessed by the rate-pressure product. Both LSD and psilocybin had dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination. Both doses of LSD and the high dose of psilocybin produced qualitatively and quantitatively very similar subjective effects, indicating that alterations of mind that are induced by LSD and psilocybin do not differ beyond the effect duration.

On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment \u00d7 opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.", "doi": "10.1523/jneurosci.1276-18.2018", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30455187/", "secondary_title": "J Neurosci"}

Psilocybin is a potent indoleamine hallucinogen and a mixed 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptor agonist. Psilocybin administration (0.25 mg/kg p.o.) produced changes in mood, disturbances in thinking, illusions, elementary and complex visual hallucinations and impaired ego-functioning.

Changes in [11C]raclopride BP in the ventral striatum correlated with depersonalization associated with euphoria. Together with previous reports of 5-HT receptor involvement in striatal dopamine release, it is concluded that stimulation of both 5-HT2A and 5-HT1A receptors may be important for the modulation of striatal dopamine release in acute psychoses.

Available antidepressants often fail to provide rapid relief of depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI) in acutely suicidal patients with MDD and there are currently no approved treatments for this population. In 2016, esketamine (ESK) was granted breakthrough therapy designation by the US Food and Drug Administration for MDD patients at imminent risk for suicide based on data suggesting rapid reduction in depressive symptoms, including SI observed at 4 hours after an initial dose of ESK nasal spray in a phase 2 study [2]. The efficacy and safety of ESK nasal spray is being further evaluated in ASPIRE\u20102, one of two phase 3 studies in the first global registration program in an understudied population of MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: ASPIRE\u20102 (NCT03097133) is an ongoing double\u2010blind (DB), randomised, placebo\u2010controlled study being conducted in Argentina, Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Lithuania, Poland, Spain, Turkey and the United States. Adult patients (18 to 64 years) with MDD (DSM\u20105 criteria, confirmed by Mini\u2010International Neuropsychiatric Interview [MINI]), with active SI and intent and in need of psychiatric hospitalisation were eligible. All patients received optimized standard\u2010of\u2010care (SoC hospitalisation and initiation/optimisation of antidepressant treatment). Patients were randomised (1:1) to ESK (84 mg) or placebo nasal spray twice\u2010weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to SoC. Change from baseline (day 1, predose) to 24 hours after first dose in Montgomery\u2010\u01fasberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary endpoint) and Clinical Global Impression \u2013 Severity of Suicidality \u2013 Revised (CGI\u2010SS\u2010R) from the Suicide Ideation and Behaviour Assessment Tool (SIBAT) were assessed for efficacy. Treatment\u2010emergent adverse events (TEAEs), potential suicidal events from the SIBAT and dissociative effects (Clinician\u2010Administered Dissociative States Scale [CADSS]) were monitored for safety. Results: In total, 230 patients have been randomised to ESK+SoC or placebo+SoC; 184 (80%) patients completed the DB treatment (Table 1). Conclusions: MDD patients with active suicidal ideation and intent represent a vulnerable group in need of rapid treatment of their symptoms. ASPIRE\u20102, along with ASPIRE\u20101, comprise a novel program that focuses on addressing depressive symptoms including SI in MDD patients, assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide who are typically excluded from clinical studies of antidepressants.

This study investigated the combined use of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients suffering from major depression. Methods: Sixteen adult patients, experiencing a major depressive episode, were randomized into two ECT treatment groups. The ketamine group (n = 8) received 0.5mg/kg ketamine + 3.5mg/kg thiopental for anesthesia prior to ECT, while the control group (n = 8) received thiopental (3.5mg/kg). ECT treatments were administered 3 times per week for 2 weeks. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was conducted at baseline, and 24\u201072 h following the 1st and the 6th ECT sessions. Results: There was a main time effect on HDRS (F(2,24) = 14.35, p < .001), reflecting an antidepressant effect over the treatment period. However, there was no group effect (F(1,12) = .09, p = .76) or group\u2010by\u2010time interaction (F(2,24) = .66, p = .52). Post\u2010hoc analyses showed no significant HDRS reduction after the 1st ECT session (p > .05). Interestingly, none of the 8\u2010ketamine subjects showed a response after the first treatment. Conclusions: The ECT appears to attenuate the rapid and potent antidepressant effect of ketamine. These findings are consistent with the view that a glutamate surge is necessary for the antidepressant effect of ketamine. A glutamate surge is likely to be blocked by the potent GABAergic effect of ECT and/or thiopental.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2012.02.014", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38591002/", "secondary_title": "Biological psychiatry"}

American and European self-help groups provided public testimonials that ibogaine alleviated drug craving and opioid withdrawal symptoms after only a single dose administration. Preclinical studies in animal models of addiction have provided proof-of-concept evidence in support of these claims. However, the purported therapeutic benefits of ibogaine are based on anecdotal reports from a small series of case reports that used retrospective recruitment procedures. We reviewed clinical results from an open label case series (N = 191) of human volunteers seeking to detoxify from opioids or cocaine with medical monitoring during inpatient treatment. Whole blood was assayed to obtain pharmacokinetic measures to determine the metabolism and clearance of ibogaine. Clinical safety data and adverse events (AEs) were studied in male and female subjects. There were no significant adverse events following administration of ibogaine in a dose range that was shown to be effective for blocking opioid withdrawal symptoms in this study. We used multi-dimensional craving questionnaires during inpatient detoxification to test if ibogaine was effective in diminishing heroin and cocaine cravings. Participants also completed standardized questionnaires about their health and mood before and after ibogaine treatment, and at program discharge. One-month follow-up data were reviewed where available to determine if ibogaine's effects on drug craving would persist outside of an inpatient setting. We report here that ibogaine therapy administered in a safe dose range diminishes opioid withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings. Pharmacological treatments for opioid dependence include detoxification, narcotic antagonists and long-term opioid maintenance therapy. Our results support product development of single oral dose administration of ibogaine for the treatment of opioid withdrawal during medically supervised detoxification to transition drug dependent individuals to abstinence.", "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2018.00529", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29922156/", "secondary_title": "Front Pharmacol"}

Assessments of the latter typically include tests of memory and everyday cognitive functioning. However, to date, little attention has been paid to effects of drug use on psychological stress reactivity. We report three studies examining the effects of recreational use of cannabis and MDMA on mood and psychological responses to multitasking using a cognitively demanding laboratory stressor that provides an analogue for everyday situations involving responses to multiple stimuli. METHODS: The effects of the multitasking framework on mood and perceived workload were assessed in cannabis (N=25), younger (N=18) and older (N=20) MDMA users and compared with non-target drug controls. RESULTS: Compared with respective control groups, cannabis users became less alert and content, and both MDMA groups became less calm following acute stress. Unexpectedly, the stressor increased ratings of calm in cannabis users. Users also scored higher than their controls with respect to ratings of resources needed to complete the multitasking framework. CONCLUSIONS: These findings show, for the first time, that recreational use of cannabis and MDMA, beyond the period of intoxication, can negatively influence psychological responses to a multitasking stressor, and this may have implications for real-life situations which place high demands on cognitive resources.", "doi": "10.1002/hup.1261", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22389081/", "secondary_title": "Hum Psychopharmacol"}

In the first randomized controlled trial of ketamine using an anesthetic control condition, we tested ketamine's acute effects on explicit suicidal cognition and a performance-based index of implicit suicidal cognition (Implicit Association Test; IAT) previously linked to suicidal behavior. METHOD: Symptomatic patients with treatment-resistant unipolar major depression (inadequate response to \u22653 antidepressants) were assessed using a composite index of explicit suicidal ideation (Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation, Montgomery-Asberg Rating Scale suicide item, Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms suicide item) and the IAT to assess suicidality implicitly. Measures were taken at baseline and 24 hr following a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine (n = 36) or midazolam (n = 21), a psychoactive placebo agent selected for its similar, rapid anesthetic effects. Twenty four hours postinfusion, explicit suicidal cognition was significantly reduced in the ketamine but not the midazolam group. RESULTS: Fifty three percent of ketamine-treated patients scored zero on all three explicit suicide measures at 24 hr, compared with 24% of the midazolam group (\u03c7(2) = 4.6; P = .03). Implicit associations between self- and escape-related words were reduced following ketamine (P = .01; d = .58) but not midazolam (P = .68; d = .09). Ketamine-specific decreases in explicit suicidal cognition were largest in patients with elevated suicidal cognition at baseline, and were mediated by decreases in nonsuicide-related depressive symptoms.

We aim to (1) characterize baseline neurocognitive performance as a predictor of the change in severity of depressive symptoms over time, and (2) investigate the association of six versus single intravenous (IV) ketamine and neurocognitive changes from baseline to the end of treatment. METHODS: Subjects with TRD were randomized to receive either five IV midazolam followed by a single IV ketamine or six IV ketamine during a 12-day period. Depression symptom assessments occurred prior and 24\u00a0h after infusion days using the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale. Neurocognitive tasks were designed to test attention, memory, speed of processing, and set shifting using the CogState battery at baseline and at the end of treatment. RESULTS: Better complex working memory at baseline predicted improvement in MADRS scores of ketamine (vs midazolam) after 5 infusions. Most, but not all, neurocognitive functions remained stable or improved after repeated or single ketamine. There was a greater differential effect of treatment on speed of processing, set shifting, and spatial working memory that favors subjects in the six ketamine group. These cognitive improvements from baseline to the end of treatment were robust when controlling for age and changes in depression severity.

In covariate-adjusted regression models, co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and six set and setting variables (no preparation, disagreeable physical environment, negative mindset, no psychological support, dose was too large, major life event prior to experience) were associated with the degree of difficulty; and co-use of lithium, co-use of other mood stabilizers, and three set and setting variables (negative mindset, no psychological support, major life event prior to experience) were associated with overall risk of harm. In summary, this study provides insight into the prevalence and associations of challenging, difficult, or distressing classic psychedelic experiences. The findings broadly correspond with findings from previous studies and can inform harm reduction efforts and future experimental research designs.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2023.01.073", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36720405/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Affective Disorders"}

Nevertheless, enhancing effects of microdosing remain anecdotal, and in the absence of quantitative research on microdosing psychedelics, it is impossible to draw definitive conclusions on that matter. Here, our main aim was to quantitatively explore the cognitive-enhancing potential of microdosing psychedelics in healthy adults. METHODS: During a microdosing event organized by the Dutch Psychedelic Society, we examined the effects of psychedelic truffles (which were later analyzed to quantify active psychedelic alkaloids) on two creativity-related problem-solving tasks: the Picture Concept Task assessing convergent thinking and the Alternative Uses Task assessing divergent thinking. A short version of the Ravens Progressive Matrices task assessed potential changes in fluid intelligence. We tested once before taking a microdose and once while the effects were expected to be manifested. RESULTS: We found that both convergent and divergent thinking performance was improved after a non-blinded microdose, whereas fluid intelligence was unaffected. CONCLUSION: While this study provides quantitative support for the cognitive-enhancing properties of microdosing psychedelics, future research has to confirm these preliminary findings in more rigorous placebo-controlled study designs. Based on these preliminary results, we speculate that psychedelics might affect cognitive metacontrol policies by optimizing the balance between cognitive persistence and flexibility. We hope this study will motivate future microdosing studies with more controlled designs to test this hypothesis.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-018-5049-7", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30357434/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

Methods: Sixteen unmedicated depressed MDD patients (7 males) participated in an fMRI study.

RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD.

Anecdotal evidence suggests that psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and other select indoleamine 5\u2010hydroxytryptamine 2A (5\u2010HT2A) receptor ligands confer sustained therapeutic benefit in cluster and migraine headache, though controlled studies are lacking. We sought to carry out the first controlled investigations of the effects and safety of psilocybin in these headache disorders. Methods: Two exploratory clinical trials were carried out in adult males and females with migraine or cluster headache (twelve each). The migraine design was a double\u2010blind, placebocontrolled, cross\u2010over study and the cluster design was a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study. Migraine subjects received single administrations of oral placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) two weeks apart. Cluster subjects were randomized to receive a pulse regimen of three administrations of either psilocybin (0.143 mg/ kg) or placebo, each administration separated by approximately 5 days. Headache diaries, in which subjects documented headache attacks, began two weeks before the first test day and ended two weeks after the second test day for migraine subjects and two months after the last test day for cluster subjects. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessionsand several follow\u2010up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures. Ten subjects in each the migraine and cluster studies were included in the final analysis. Results: Over the 2\u2010week period after single drug administration, the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin [\u20101.65 (95% CI: \u20102.53 to \u20100.77) days/week] than after placebo [\u20100.15 (\u20101.13 to 0.83) days/ week; p = 0.003, t(9) = 4.11; effect size \u20101.15]. Over the 3\u2010week period after initiating the pulse regimen, the reduction in weekly cluster attacks from baseline was greater with psilocybin [\u20106.03 (\u20109.96 to \u20102.10)] than with placebo [+1.17 (\u20102.76 to 5.10); p = 0.017, t(8) = 2.99; effect size \u20101.89]. In neither study did the rating of psychedelic effects during acute psilocybin exposure correlate with the change in headache burden.

We conducted a single-arm, open-label phase II trial at the Princess Margaret Cancer Centre in Toronto, ON, Canada. Participants with advanced cancer with moderate to severe MDD received three flexible doses of intranasal (IN) ketamine (50\u2212150 mg) over a one-week period.

A recent Phase 3 clinical trial reported high efficacy of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted therapy for treating patients with severe PTSD compared to a therapy with placebo group (NCT03537014). This raises important questions regarding potential mechanisms of MDMA-assisted therapy. In the present study, we examined epigenetic changes in three key HPA axis genes before and after MDMA and placebo with therapy. As a pilot sub-study to the parent clinical trial, we assessed potential HPA epigenetic predictors for treatment response with genomic DNA derived from saliva (MDMA, n = 16; placebo, n = 7). Methylation levels at all 259 CpG sites annotated to three HPA genes (CRHR1, FKBP5, and NR3C1) were assessed in relation to treatment response as measured by the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-5; Total Severity Score). Second, group (MDMA vs. placebo) differences in methylation change were assessed for sites that predicted treatment response. RESULTS: Methylation change across groups significantly predicted symptom reduction on 37 of 259 CpG sites tested, with two sites surviving false discovery rate (FDR) correction. Further, the MDMA-treatment group showed more methylation change compared to placebo on one site of the NR3C1 gene. CONCLUSION: The findings of this study suggest that therapy-related PTSD symptom improvements may be related to DNA methylation changes in HPA genes and such changes may be greater in those receiving MDMA-assisted therapy.

This single-site, open-label study investigates the proof of principle and safety of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and provides an initial impression of treatment effectiveness. METHODS: A total of 12 participants [>18 years] with DSM-5 diagnosis of MDD will receive a flexible dose of MDMA in a therapeutic setting on two dosing days over a 4 week period preceded by three preparatory sessions. Each MDMA dosing session will be followed by three integration sessions. The primary outcome is change in MDD symptom severity, as measured by the mean change in MADRS scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session. The secondary outcome is change in functional impairment, as evaluated by the mean change in Sheehan Disability Scale scores from Baseline to 8 weeks after the second MDMA session. Safety measures include vital signs, the incidence of Adverse Events and suicidality as measured by the Colombia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale. DISCUSSION: This proof of principle trial will inform the development of fully powered clinical trials, optimize the protocol for the administration of MDMA-AT in participants with MDD and explore uncertainties including barriers to recruitment, retention and acceptability of MDMA-AT as a treatment for MDD.

Eight months before her first appointment with one of the authors, the patient was in her usual state of health. She had a history of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder, successfully treated with venlafaxine prescribed by her psychiatrist. At this time, her sleep, appetite, concentration, and range of mood were normal. She was employed as a senior associate at a high-level accounting firm and had graduated from a prestigious graduate school, both competitive environments in which she excelled. In the fall of 2020, at the urging of friends, the patient decided to ingest psilocybin mushrooms. She was still consistently taking venlafaxine at the time of ingestion. Hours after the second ingestion, she developed paranoid delusions, which persisted for months. After 2 months, during which she titrated up to the relatively high dosage of 4.5 mg/day of pramipexole, she reported a significant shift in her functioning. She started to feel emotions again, and began to performbasic errands and self-care. Using the experience of the patient presented in this case\u2014a patient who experienced a profound negative reaction after recreational ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms\u2014to understand some of the risks associated with psychedelic use, authors discuss several challenging issues that are emerging as psychedelics receive more media attention and become more available. Authors explore differences between clinical and nonclinical psychedelic use and their attendant risks and benefits. This case suggests that current policy trends, including efforts to render psychedelics widely available for therapeutic use, will place patients at undue risk. Finally, authors make recommendations for the future of psychedelic research and clinical applications based on the patient\u2019s experience. Details of the case have been modified to protect the patient\u2019s identity, and the patient has approved publication of the case for educational purposes. Psychiatrists have an ethical obligation to maintain clinical equipoise with regard to new treatments while they are still in the investigational stage. At this point, psychedelics are on track to becoming an evidence-based psychiatric intervention, with positive clinical trials thus far. Optimism about these positive results is warranted, but psychiatrists should be aware that only a few hundred patients have actually received psilocybin in clinical research settings\u2014which suggests a field that is still in its infancy\u2014and, in contrast to other randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, blinding is simply not possible with psilocybin. Psychiatrists should remain open to any outcome of clinical research while the safety and efficacy of psychedelics are still being determined. Right now, a promising psychiatric treatment risks getting swept up in a broader cultural moment\u2014a dynamic that could lead to compromises in quality and reduce the efficacy of psychedelic therapies. Similar cultural forces led to the demise of psychedelic therapies a half century ago. Today we find ourselves in the unprecedented position where the safety and efficacy of medical treatments are being decided by popular opinion\u2014and at the expense of the scientific process. The field of psychiatry should stand for the integrity of the scientific process, and encourage the development and administration of new treatments, including psychedelic therapies, in ways that maximize their safety and efficacy.

Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, specific receptor contributions to its neurobiological effects remain unknown. METHODS: We therefore conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross-over studyduring which 24 healthy human participants received either (i) placebo+placebo, (ii) placebo+LSD (100 \u00b5g po), or (iii) Ketanserin, a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist,+LSD. We quantified resting-state functional connectivity via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared it to cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: LSD reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory-somatomotor brain-wide and thalamic connectivity. Ketanserin fully blocked the subjective and neural LSD effects. Whole-brain spatial patterns of LSD effects matched 5-HT2A receptor cortical gene expression in humans. CONCLUSIONS: Together, these results strongly implicate the 5-HT2A receptor in LSD\u2019s neuropharmacology. This study therefore pinpoints the critical role of 5-HT2A in LSD\u2019s mechanism, which informs its neurobiology and guides rational development of psychedelic-based therapeutics.

CLINICAL TRIAL NUMBER: NCT02451072 The psychedelic drug LSD alters thinking and perception. Users can experience hallucinations, in which they, for example, see things that are not there. Colors, sounds and objects can appear distorted, and time can seem to speed up or slow down. These changes bear some resemblance to the changes in thinking and perception that occur in certain psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia. Studying how LSD affects the brain could thus offer insights into the mechanisms underlying these conditions. There is also evidence that LSD itself could help to reduce the symptoms of depression and anxiety disorders. Preller et al. have now used brain imaging to explore the effects of LSD on the brains of healthy volunteers. This revealed that LSD reduced communication among brain areas involved in planning and decision-making, but it increased communication between areas involved in sensation and movement. Volunteers whose brains showed the most communication between sensory and movement areas also reported the strongest effects of LSD on their thinking and perception. Preller et al. also found that another drug called Ketanserin prevented LSD from altering how different brain regions communicate. It also prevented LSD from inducing changes in thinking and perception. Ketanserin blocks a protein called the serotonin 2A receptor, which is activated by a brain chemical called serotonin that, amongst other roles, helps to regulate mood. By mapping the location of the gene that produces the serotonin 2A receptor, Preller et al. showed that the receptor is present in brain regions that show altered communication after LSD intake, therefore pinpointing the importance of this receptor in the effects of LSD. Psychiatric disorders that produce psychotic symptoms affect vast numbers of people worldwide. Further research into how LSD affects the brain could help us to better understand how such symptoms arise, and may also lead to the development of more effective treatments for a range of mental health conditions. eng", "doi": "10.7554/eLife.35082", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30355445/", "secondary_title": "Elife"}

Aims: The present post hoc analyses sought to determine whether the subjective effects of psilocybin are affected by body weight when psilocybin is administered on a weight-adjusted basis and when psilocybin is administered as a fixed dose. Methods: We analyzed acute subjective drug effects (mystical, challenging, and intensity) associated with therapeutic outcomes from ten previous studies (total N = 288) in which psilocybin was administered in the range 20 to 30 mg/70 kg (inclusive). Separate multivariate regression analyses examined the relationships between demographic variables including body weight and subjective effects in participants receiving 20 mg/70 kg (n = 120), participants receiving 30 mg/70 kg (n = 182), and participants whose weight-adjusted dose was about 25 mg (to approximate the fixed dose that is currently being evaluated in registration trials for major depressive disorder) (n = 103). Results: In the 20 mg/70 kg and 30 mg/70 kg weight-adjusted groups, and in the fixed dose group, no significant associations were found between subjective effects and demographic variables including body weight or sex. Across a wide range of body weights (49 to 113 kg) the present results showed no evidence that body weight affected subjective effects of psilocybin.

To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment of TRD with psychotic symptoms with esketamine administered subcutaneously. Ketamine has been used to induce a pharmacological model of psychosis, because it produces a syndrome consisting of disordered thought, perceptual abnormalities, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and memory impairments in healthy subjects. Because of that, nearly all clinical and research protocols have used the presence of psychotic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for treatment with ketamine. However, different sources of evidence have suggested that psychotic manifestations associated with ketamine are transient and clinically non significant. Although ketamine has significant perceptual effects, they are transient and usually occur at higher doses than those necessary for depression treatment. In addition, the findings of the present study are in line with previous studies reporting remission of both depressive and psychotic symptoms after treatment of patients with depression and acute psychosis or a history of psychosis. Moreover, studies examining patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern of psychotomimetic manifestations following low-dose ketamine administration. Notably, they experienced mild, short-lasting increases in psychotic symptoms, but these had no impact on the longterm outcome of these patients with psychosis. As previously suggested, inclusion of patients with psychotic depression in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine should be encouraged.

Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant.

Importantly, it has been suggested that use of MDMA may be neurotoxic particularly for serotonergic (5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)) neurons. In the past decades, several molecular imaging studies examined directly in vivo the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems. OBJECTIVES: The objective of the present study is to review the effects of ecstasy/MDMA on neurotransmitter systems as assessed by molecular imaging studies in small animals, non-human primates and humans. METHODS: A search in PubMed was performed. Eighty-eight articles were found on which inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied. RESULTS: Thirty-three studies met the inclusion criteria; all were focused on the 5-HT or dopamine (DA) system. Importantly, 9 out of 11 of the animal studies that examined the effects of MDMA on 5-HT transporter (SERT) availability showed a significant loss of binding potential. In human studies, this was the case for 14 out of 16 studies, particularly in heavy users. In abstinent users, significant recovery of SERT binding was found over time. Most imaging studies in humans that focused on the DA system did not find any significant effect of ecstasy/MDMA use. CONCLUSIONS: Preclinical and clinical molecular imaging studies on the effects of ecstasy/MDMA use/administration on neurotransmitter systems show quite consistent alterations of the 5-HT system. Particularly, in human studies, loss of SERT binding was observed in heavy ecstasy users, which might reflect 5-HT neurotoxicity, although alternative explanations (e.g. down-regulation of the SERT) cannot be excluded.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-016-4396-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27568200/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

Structural MRI was used to parcel the thalamus into its constituent nuclei based on individual anatomy. Nucleus-specific changes of resting-state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) connectivity were mapped using a seed-based approach. LSD intake selectively increased the thalamocortical functional connectivity (FC) of the ventral complex, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei. Functional coupling was increased between these nuclei and sensory cortices that include the somatosensory and auditory networks. The ventral and pulvinar nuclei also exhibited increased FC with parts of the associative cortex that are dense in serotonin type 2A receptors. These areas are hyperactive and hyper-connected upon LSD intake. At subcortical levels, LSD increased the functional coupling among the thalamus's ventral, pulvinar, and non-specific nuclei, but decreased the striatal-thalamic connectivity.

Intravenous propofol, a sedative and hypnotic agent, is one of the choices of anesthetic for ECT. Ketamine, another anesthetic agent, providing sedation, amnesia, and analgesia, can also be used in patients undergoing ECT owing to its rapid action and persistent antidepressive effect. One adverse effect of ketamine is cardiovascular excitement, which may be reduced by propofol. Currently, the effects of combined anesthesia (propofol and ketamine) for patients with depressive disorder who have undergone ECT are unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of the combined agents for patients undergoing ECT. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores greater than 20 were randomly divided into 3 groups (n=16 each): propofol group (group P), ketamine group (group K), and propofol plus ketamine group (group PK). Propofol (1.5 mg/kg), ketamine (0.8 mg/kg), and propofol (1.5 mg/kg) plus ketamine (0.8 mg/kg) were infused to each group of patients, respectively, before ECT by an anesthesiologist with no knowledge of the HDRS score. For the purpose of this study, the patients received a single ECT treatment and were assessed for depression using the HDRS scores (1 day before ECT and days 1, 2, 3, and 7 after the ECT treatment) by a psychiatrist with no knowledge of the randomization group. After the final assessment, the patients received further treatment as needed up to 3 treatments per week. Seizure energy index, seizure duration, and adverse effects were observed during anesthesia by a nurse with no knowledge of the study group. RESULTS: The HDRS scores improved earlier in group K and group PK. Decreases in HDRS scores were significantly greater in group K and group PK compared with those in group P. The adverse effects in group PK were fewer than those in group K. Seizure energy index and seizure duration in group K and group PK were higher and longer than those in group P during ECT.

Although the main focus was on efficacy and safety, study characteristics, duration of antidepressants effects across studies, and the role of the subjective drug experiences were also reviewed and presented. METHOD: A systematic literature search (1 Jan 2000 to 1 May 2020) was conducted in PubMed and PsychINFO for studies of patients undergoing treatment with a serotonergic psychedelic. RESULTS: Data from 16 papers, representing 10 independent psychedelic-assisted therapy trials (psilocybin\u00a0=\u00a07, ayahuasca\u00a0=\u00a02, LSD\u00a0=\u00a01), were extracted, presented in figures and tables, and narratively synthesized and discussed. Across these studies, a total of 188 patients suffering either cancer- or illness-related anxiety and depression disorders (C/I-RADD), major depressive disorder (MDD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or substance use disorder (SUD) were included. The reviewed studies established feasibility and evidence of safety, alongside promising early data of efficacy in the treatment of depression, anxiety, OCD, and tobacco and alcohol use disorders. For a majority of patients, the therapeutic effects appeared to be long-lasting (weeks-months) after only 1 to 3 treatment session(s). All studies were conducted in line with guidelines for the safe conduct of psychedelic therapy, and no severe adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: The resurrection of clinical psychedelic research provides early evidence for treatment efficacy and safety for a range of psychiatric conditions, and constitutes an exciting new treatment avenue in a health area with major unmet needs.", "doi": "10.1111/acps.13249", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33125716/", "secondary_title": "Acta Psychiatr Scand"}

Ten in-patients with neuropathic pain participated in this single-blind, placebo-controlled study after giving written informed consent. Following intravenous injections of a saline solution (placebo), three bolus injections of 5 mg ketamine HCl were administered at 5 min intervals. Changes in pain perception were assessed using a numerical rating scale for pain. Behavioral changes, including psychotomimetic effects, were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Electroencephalograms (EEG) and electrooculograms (EOG) were recorded continuously throughout the testing period. One minute EEG and closed-eye eye movements were quantified. The effects of ketamine were evaluated by comparing the neurophysiological and behavioral parameters obtained from the placebo and ketamine trials. Pain reduction was significantly correlated with ketamine-induced changes in hallucinatory behavior and excitement as measured by the BPRS. Ketamine injections caused a significant decrease in the EEGalpha amplitude without an accompanying reduction in EEG frequency. The EEGalpha amplitude reduction at the right central electrode was significantly related to subjective pain relief. Subanesthetic doses of ketamine significantly decreased rapid eye movements, but did not initiate slow eye movements. In conclusion, the present EEG-EOG/behavioral results indicate that ketamine-induced failure of neural integration between cortical-subcortical regions induces psychotic symptoms and alters pain perception on neuropathic pain.", "doi": "10.1046/j.1440-1819.2002.01023.x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12109952/", "secondary_title": "Psychiatry Clin Neurosci"}

To test this hypothesis, depressed patients were pretreated with rapamycin, an mTORC1 inhibitor, prior to receiving ketamine. Twenty patients suffering a major depressive episode were randomized to pretreatment with oral rapamycin (6\u2009mg) or placebo 2\u2009h prior to the intravenous administration of ketamine 0.5\u2009mg/kg in a double-blind cross-over design with treatment days separated by at least 2 weeks.

Over the subsequent 2-weeks, we found a significant treatment by time interaction (F((8,245))\u2009=\u20092.02, p\u2009=\u20090.04), suggesting a prolongation of the antidepressant effects of ketamine by rapamycin.

In summary, single dose rapamycin pretreatment failed to block the antidepressant effects of ketamine, but it prolonged ketamine's antidepressant effects.

This study sought to develop a new scale to measure psychological insight after a psychedelic experience: the Psychological Insight Scale (PIS). Methods: The PIS is a six- to seven-item questionnaire that enquires about psychological insight after a psychedelic experience (PIS-6) and accompanied behavioural changes (PIS item 7). In total, 886 participants took part in a study in which the PIS and other questionnaires were completed in a prospective fashion in relation to a planned psychedelic experience. For validation purposes, data from 279 participants were analysed from a non-specific \u2018global psychedelic survey\u2019 study. Results: Principal components analysis of PIS scores revealed a principal component explaining 73.57% of the variance, which displayed high internal consistency at multiple timepoints throughout the study (average Cronbach\u2019s \u03b1 = 0.94). Criterion validity was confirmed using the global psychedelic survey study, and convergent validity was confirmed via the Therapeutic-Realizations Scale. Furthermore, PIS scores significantly mediated the relationship between emotional breakthrough and long-term well-being. Conclusion: The PIS is complementary to current subjective measures used in psychedelic studies, most of which are completed in relation to the acute experience. Insight \u2013 as measured by the PIS \u2013 was found to be a key mediator of long-term psychological outcomes following a psychedelic experience.

A limitation of ketamine treatment in TRD is the relatively short duration of time to relapse (e.g., median 2-4\u00a0weeks). The objective of the systematic review herein is to identify strategies capable of prolonging the acute efficacy of ketamine in adults with TRD. METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE databases were searched from inception to December 2020 for clinical studies written in English using the following key terms: ketamine, prolong, and depression. A total of 454 articles were identified from the literature search which included all clinical studies regarding prolonging the antidepressant effects of ketamine. Twenty-two articles were included: ten randomized controlled trials (RCTs), eight prospective open-label trials, one retrospective chart review, and three case reports. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used for data extraction. The primary outcome was prolonged effect, defined as statistically significant antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. RESULTS: A total of 454 articles were identified, and 22 articles were included. Different treatment modalites including pharmacological interventions, manualized-based psychotherapies, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and intravenous monotherapy were examined to determine their impact on the prolongation of antidepressant effects following acute ketamine treatment. No treatment modality, other than repeat-dose IV ketamine, has demonstrated ability to significantly prolong the acute efficacy of IV ketamine in TRD. CONCLUSION: Hitherto, available open-label data and controlled trial data support repeat administration of IV ketamine as an effective strategy to prolong the efficacy of ketamine's antidepressant effects (although not the focus of the study herein, maintenance repeat-dose esketamine treatment is proven effective in esketamine responders). There is a need to identify multimodality strategies that are safe and capable of prolonging the efficacy of ketamine in adults with TRD.", "doi": "10.1007/s12325-021-01732-8", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33929660/", "secondary_title": "Adv Ther"}

RESULTS: Prolactin response to d-fenfluramine was slightly blunted in female ecstasy users. Both male user samples exhibited a weak prolactin response to d-fenfluramine, but this was weaker in the group of cannabis users. Baseline prolactin and prolactin response to d-fenfluramine were associated with the extent of previous cannabis use.

Its effects on neurocognitive functioning in such individuals with significant suicidal ideation is not well understood, even though certain neurocognitive deficits are associated with suicide behavior beyond clinical symptoms. Methods: In this study, depressed patients with clinically significant suicidal ideation (n\u2009=\u200978) underwent neuropsychological testing before and 1 day after double-blind treatment with intravenous ketamine (n\u2009=\u200939) or midazolam (n\u2009=\u200939). A subgroup randomized to midazolam whose ideation did not remit after initial infusion received open ketamine and additional neurocognitive testing a day after this treatment. The primary outcome was change in performance on this neurocognitive battery. The study was conducted between November 2012 and January 2017. Results: Blinded ketamine produced rapid improvement in suicidal ideation and mood in comparison to midazolam, as we had reported previously. Ketamine, relative to midazolam, was also associated with specific improvement in reaction time (Choice RT) and interference processing/cognitive control (computerized Stroop task)-the latter a measure that has been associated with past suicide attempt in depression. In midazolam nonremitters later treated with open ketamine and retested, reaction time and interference processing/cognitive control also improved relative to both of their prior assessments. Neurocognitive improvement, however, was not correlated with changes in depression, suicidal thinking, or general mood. Conclusions: Overall, ketamine was found to have a positive therapeutic effect on neurocognition 1 day after treatment on at least 1 measure associated with suicidal behavior in the context of depression. Results suggest additional independent therapeutic effects for ketamine in the treatment of depressed patients at risk for suicidal behavior.
