Electroencephalographic (EEG)-derived measures have shown promise in predicting antidepressant response to a variety of treatments, and are sensitive to ketamine administration. This study examined their utility in characterizing changes in depressive symptoms following single and repeated ketamine infusions. METHODS: Recordings were obtained from patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (N = 24) enrolled in a multi-phase clinical ketamine trial. During the randomized, double-blind, crossover phase (Phase 1), patients received intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and midazolam (30 μg/kg), at least 1 week apart. For each medication, three resting, eyes-closed recordings were obtained per session (pre-infusion, immediately post-infusion, 2 h post-infusion), and changes in power (delta, theta1/2/total, alpha1/2/total, beta, gamma), alpha asymmetry, theta cordance, and theta source-localized anterior cingulate cortex activity were quantified. The relationships between ketamine-induced changes with early (Phase 1) and sustained (Phases 2,3: open-label repeated infusions) decreases in depressive symptoms (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Score, MADRS) and suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10) were examined. RESULTS: Both medications decreased alpha and theta immediately post-infusion, however, only midazolam increased delta (post-infusion), and only ketamine increased gamma (immediately post- and 2 h post-infusion).

This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.All included studies administered ketamine intravenously, which can pose practical problems in clinical practice.

This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.All included studies administered ketamine intravenously, which can pose practical problems in clinical practice.

MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine, and norepinephrine (NE). NE release is thought to mediate the cardiovascular effects of MDMA and may also contribute to its psychostimulant effects. However, the functional role of adrenergic postsynaptic receptors in the cardiovascular and subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of alpha‐adrenergic receptors in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the alpha1‐receptor blocker doxazosin on the physiological and subjective effects of MDMA.

The primary outcome was depression severity measured by the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at 1, 2, and 3 days post‐infusion.

However, the mechanism underlying these effects remain unclear. One proposed mechanism is that these drugs promote neuroplasticity. However, this has not been conclusively demonstrated in humans. AIMS: We hypothesized that relative to placebo, psilocybin would: (1) increase electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of neuroplasticity, (2) reduce depression symptoms, and (3) changes in EEG would correlate with improvements in depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study, individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD; n = 19) were administered placebo followed by psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) in a fixed order (placebo, followed by psilocybin 4 weeks later). EEG indices of neuroplasticity (tetanus-induced long-term potentiation) as assessed via auditory evoked theta (4-8 Hz) power and measures of depression (GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression-17 (GRID-HAM-D-17)) were measured at several time-points after placebo and psilocybin (24 h and 2 weeks after each session). RESULTS: EEG theta power doubled in amplitude 2 weeks after a single psychedelic dose of psilocybin but not after placebo. Further, improvements in depression symptoms 2 weeks after psilocybin were correlated with increases in theta power. CONCLUSIONS: The increased theta power observed represents evidence of sustained changes in the brain following psilocybin. Given the correlation with enhancement in depressive symptoms, changes in theta may represent an EEG biomarker of the sustained effects of psilocybin, and may shed light on potential mechanisms of psilocybin's antidepressant effect.

Hedges' g and risk ratios and their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using a random-effects model. The primary outcome was depressive symptom change. Secondary outcomes included response, remission, all-cause discontinuation and adverse effects. RESULTS: A total of 14 RCTs (nine ketamine studies: n = 234; five non-ketamine NMDAR antagonist studies: n = 354; MDD = 554, BD = 34), lasting 10.0 ± 8.8 days, were meta-analysed. Ketamine reduced depression significantly more than placebo/pseudo-placebo beginning at 40 min, peaking at day 1 (Hedges' g = -1.00, 95% CI -1.28 to -0.73, p < 0.001), and loosing superiority by days 10-12. Non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists were superior to placebo only on days 5-8 (Hedges' g = -0.37, 95% CI -0.66 to -0.09, p = 0.01). Compared with placebo/pseudo-placebo, ketamine led to significantly greater response (40 min to day 7) and remission (80 min to days 3-5). Non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists achieved greater response at day 2 and days 3-5. All-cause discontinuation was similar between ketamine (p = 0.34) or non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists (p = 0.94) and placebo. Although some adverse effects were more common with ketamine/NMDAR antagonists than placebo, these were transient and clinically insignificant. CONCLUSIONS: A single infusion of ketamine, but less so of non-ketamine NMDAR antagonists, has ultra-rapid efficacy for MDD and BD, lasting for up to 1 week.

This is based on consumption patterns, context of use, development of use patterns and other factors. This group of users might be considered \"club drug users\", given the overlap, similarity of use patterns and consumptions within the class of club drugs. In recent neurobiological research, alarming results have been reported, indicating that persistent neurotoxic effects with concomitant cognitive problems may be induced by ecstasy consumption. Methods: In the Munich Assessment of Young Adults Study (MAYA) two samples of ecstasy users are investigated. Sample A is a sample of users drawn from an ongoing epidemiological longitudinal study of young adults in Munich. Sample B is an additional clinical sample. Both samples are characterized extensively and are neuropsychologically tested for attention, memory and executive functioning. A screening for harmful use is conducted with the German version of the WHO ASSIST (Alcohol, Smoking and Substance Involvement Screening Test). A Motivational Enhancement Intervention is applied when harmful use is detected. With a telephone interview the intervention's initial effect is assessed. Results: Initial results are based on a small sample. Use within the tested population is low to moderate. Still significant differences in attention, memory, and executive functioning could be detected with the current testing. Ecstasy users almost consistently showed the lowest cognitive functioning.

Methods: Midazolam 0.02 mg/kg was administered to all patients as premedication. Patients were randomly allocated in one of the following groups: Ketamine group and Control group. All patients received spinal anesthesia. Both groups received systemic i.v. analgesia with morphine 0.15 mg/kg plus ketoprophene 300 mg by elastomeric infusion pump at the rate of 2 ml/h for 24 h.

Numerous alternative routes of administration are being investigated. Oral ketamine is particularly appealing for its ease of use with the potential for high accessibility. The objective of the current systematic review, in accordance with PRISMA, is to determine the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and dose range of oral ketamine for bipolar and unipolar depression. DATA SOURCES: The MEDLINE/PubMed, EMBASE, and Google Scholar databases were systematically searched for relevant articles, written in English, published prior to July 2018 using relevant keywords for all variants of ketamine, oral, and depression. STUDY SELECTION: All clinical studies assessing oral ketamine for bipolar or unipolar depression were included. A total of 13 published articles were identified, of which 2 were proof-of-concept, randomized controlled trials (RCTs); 1 was a prospective open-label trial; 5 were retrospective chart reviews; and 5 were case reports. DATA EXTRACTION: Included articles were qualitatively analyzed to determine antidepressant efficacy, tolerability, safety, dose range, antisuicide effects, time to effect, and efficacy in treatment-resistant depression and study bias. RESULTS: Both RCTs demonstrated antidepressant efficacy with good tolerability; however, significant changes in depressive symptom severity were observed only after 2-6 weeks of treatment (P < .05). Both RCTs had high risk for bias, due to inadequate intent-to-treat analysis and adverse effect monitoring. Rapid antidepressant effects (ie, within 24 hours), antisuicide effects, and efficacy in treatment-resistant depression were reported only in retrospective studies. Dosages and frequency of administration were variable (ie, 0.5-7.0 mg/kg 3 times daily to once monthly), with most studies providing dosages of 1-2 mg/kg every 1-3 days. No clinically significant adverse effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: A small number of clinical studies assessed the antidepressant effects of oral ketamine. Initial results suggest that oral ketamine has significant antidepressant effects with good overall tolerability; however, antidepressant effects are not as rapid as those associated with IV ketamine. Antisuicide effects and efficacy in treatment-resistant depression have yet to be demonstrated. Additional well-designed RCTs are warranted.", "doi": "10.4088/JCP.18r12475", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30995364/", "secondary_title": "J Clin Psychiatry", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Although standard therapy and prescriptions are often effective, it is known that treatment is not a \"one‐size‐fits‐all\" cure; many patients experience unbearable side effects, and some never reach remission. In light of this, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, with preliminary clinical trials using 'regular' full psychedelic doses demonstrating promising results. Over the last couple of years, the use of low 'micro' doses of psychedelics for health‐related purposes has received increased visibility and interest to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression or pain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that next to regular psychedelic doses, low doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing for symptomatic relief is lacking and no scientific effort is made to inquire on a larger scale for which conditions people use psychedelic microdoses and whether they deem this to be more effective than standard treatments (ST) or 'regular' high psychedelic doses (HPD). The present study therefore investigated the self‐rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP), compared to ST and HDP. Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora for four months. In total 63% (N = 3'590) of the people who initially clicked the link consented and were 18 years of age or older and completed the survey. Of them, 7.2% (N = 410) had experience with microdosing and was diagnosed by a medical doctor or therapist with at least one mental or physical disorder. This group was included in the analyses. Respondents were asked which psychedelics they used to selfmedicate with, for which condition and whether they experienced it as effective. The latter was assessed with three questions: 'Do you feel the treatment worked' (Q1), 'did the symptoms disappear' (Q2), and 'did your quality of life improve' (Q3). Binary logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) was conducted to compare the SRE with psychedelic microdoses with ST, and HDP, for the mental and physical disorder diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions. When cell count was less than 10 events per independent variable, no regression was conducted. For each OR, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given and statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. An OR of 1.5 is defined as small, two as medium, and three as large. Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was statistically higher (p < 0.01) compared to that of ST for both mental (OR(Q1) = 2.3; OR(Q2) = 2.48; OR(Q3) = 2.77) and physical (OR(Q1) = 6.14; OR(Q2) = 7.74; OR(Q3) = 4.36) diagnoses.

Preliminary evidence suggests that intravenous ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, making it a candidate with therapeutic potential for depressed patients at risk for suicide. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI), as well as their respective onset and duration of action.

RESULTS: A group-by-drug interaction was observed in several brain regions, including a right frontal cluster extending into the anterior cingulate cortex and insula.

Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life‐threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 3,‐4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may assist people who are anxious as a result of facing a life‐threatening illness. This randomized, placebo‐controlled pilot study of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in 18 people with anxiety stemming from a life‐threatening illness examines the safety and efficacy of this treatment. This study will allow comparison between the impact of placebo and an active dose of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy on anxiety, depression, sleep quality, global functioning, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life. Participants must be people of either gender aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a life‐threatening cancer or non‐dementing neurological illness and anxiety resulting from confronting this illness. Eighteen participants will be enrolled in the study. Five of 18 participants will receive placebo and 13 will receive MDMA. Therapy will be conducted by male/female teams, some of whom will be experienced therapists, and the others will be intern therapists under supervision of the Principal Investigator. In the first study segment, Stage 1, all participants will have two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy scheduled at a two to four week interval, within a moderate course of non‐drug psychotherapy (preparatory and integrative sessions), after which they will complete the primary endpoint assessment. After the primary endpoint assessment, the subject and therapists will be unblinded and fully debriefed. Participants assigned to receive active dose MDMA will then receive a third open‐label experimental session with the same active dose of MDMA, which will complete Stage 1. Participants assigned to receive placebo will crossover, without completing Stage 1, to an open‐label study segment following similar procedures, referred to as Stage 2. Participants enrolled in this group will receive the same dose of MDMA as the active dose in Stage 1, with an optional supplemental half dose, at each of three experimental sessions at time points equivalent to those in Stage 1. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self‐compassion, and overall quality of life will be assessed by participants' self‐report at baseline, the primary endpoint, and one month after the third experimental session in Stage 1, and at equivalent points in Stage 2. Additional assessments of depression and overall psychological functioning will be made by a blinded Independent Rater at these time points. A caregiver and individuals in close relationship to the study subject will also provide ratings of the subject's posttraumatic growth and mood.

Neuroimaging studies reveal striking overlap in the effects of psilocybin and the effects of meditation on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). This ongoing study explored the effects of psilocybin on subjective experience and DMN connectivity in long‐term meditators. Methods: 16 meditators (mean lifetime meditation = 4206 h) received either a placebo (n = 8) or a high dose psilocybin (n = 8) capsule before a laboratory session. Retrospective self‐report measures of subjective experience and resting‐state fMRI data were collected the day after the session. Seed‐based functional connectivity analyses were applied to fMRI data. Self‐report measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups. Results: Participants who received psilocybin attributed significantly greater meaning, spiritual significance, psychological challenge, and psychological insight to their session experiences than those who received placebo. 75% of participants in the psilocybin group rated the experience to be in the top 10 most meaningful experiences of their life. Participants who received psilocybin also showed lower functional connectivity between hippocampal and posterior DMN regions and greater functional connectivity among DMN regions than those who received placebo.

A key feature of this disorder is impairments in cognitive function. OBJECTIVE: The present study sought to investigate the effects of ketamine, an NMDA antagonist, on the performance and neural correlates of verbal fluency, a task that engages executive function. METHODS: Ten healthy dextral male volunteers received intravenous placebo normal saline or ketamine (bolus of 0.23 mg/kg and infusion of 0.65 mg/kg), administered in a double-blind, randomized order, during two functional magnetic resonance imaging sessions. During scanning, subjects performed a verbal fluency task. Two levels of cognitive load were examined in the task, and overt responses were acquired in order to measure subject performance on-line. RESULTS: Ketamine induced symptoms in the healthy individuals comparable to an acute psychotic state. Although ketamine did not significantly impair task performance relative to placebo, an interaction of task demand with ketamine was observed in the anterior cingulate, prefrontal, and striatal regions. CONCLUSIONS: The behavioural and functional effects of ketamine during verbal fluency in healthy individuals were comparable to those evident in patients with schizophrenia.

SAD is the fourth most commonly diagnosed psychological disorder in the United States with onset commonly occurring in adolescence and assuming a chronic course even when treated. Evidence‐based treatments for SAD exist, including medications and therapy, but a significant proportion of patients fail to improve, indicating the need for novel effective treatments. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser and re‐uptake inhibitor with indirect effects on neurohormone release.

It has long been hypothesized that dysregulation of subcortical dopamine systems in schizophrenia might result from a failure of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) to adequately control subcortical dopaminergic function.

The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that a pharmacologically induced disruption of NMDA transmission leads to an increase in amphetamine-induced dopamine release in humans. METHODS: In eight healthy volunteers, we compared striatal amphetamine-induced (0.25 mg/kg) dopamine release under control conditions and under sustained disruption of NMDA transmission induced by infusion of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine (0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus followed by 0.4 mg/kg/hour intravenous infusion for 4 hours). Amphetamine-induced dopamine release was determined with single photon emission computed tomography, as the reduction in the binding potential (BP) of the radiolabeled D(2) receptor antagonist [(123)I]IBZM.

OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability and tolerability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020.  We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ketamine, memantine, esketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (pill or saline infusion), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were response rate (50% reduction on a standardised rating scale) and adverse events. We decided a priori to measure the efficacy outcomes at different time points and run sensitivity/subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one new studies were identified for inclusion in this updated review. Overall, we included 64 studies (5299 participants) on ketamine (31 trials), esketamine (9), memantine (5), lanicemine (4), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), riluzole (2), atomoxetine (1), basimglurant (1), citicoline (1), CP-101,606 (1), decoglurant (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), rapastinel (1), and sarcosine (1). Forty-eight studies were placebo-controlled, and 48 were two-arm studies. The majority of trials defined an inclusion criterion for the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline: 29 at least moderate depression; 17 severe depression; and five mild-to-moderate depression. Nineteen studies recruited only patients with treatment-resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to at least two antidepressants. The majority of studies investigating ketamine administered as a single dose, whilst all of the included esketamine studies used a multiple dose regimen (most frequently twice a week for four weeks). Most studies looking at ketamine used intravenous administration, whilst the majority of esketamine trials used intranasal routes. The evidence suggests that ketamine may result in an increase in response and remission compared with placebo at 24 hours odds ratio (OR) 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54 to 10.10; n = 185, studies = 7, very low-certainty evidence). Ketamine may reduce depression rating scale scores over placebo at 24 hours, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.87, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.48; n = 231, studies = 8, very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants assigned to ketamine or placebo who dropped out for any reason (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.28; n = 201, studies = 6, very low-certainty evidence). When compared with midazolam, the evidence showed that ketamine increases remission rates at 24 hours (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.32; n = 122,studies = 2, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the response efficacy of ketamine at 24 hours in comparison with midazolam, and its ability to reduce depression rating scale scores at the same time point (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.18; n = 296, studies = 4,very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who dropped out of studies for any reason between ketamine and placebo (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.09; n = 72, studies = 1, low-certainty evidence). Esketamine treatment likely results in a large increase in participants achieving remission at 24 hours compared with placebo (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.40; n = 894, studies = 5, moderate-certainty evidence). Esketamine probably results in decreases in depression rating scale scores at 24 hours compared with placebo (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.17; n = 824, studies = 4, moderate-certainty evidence). Our findings show that esketamine increased response rates, although this evidence is uncertain (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.68; n = 1071, studies = 5, low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that participants assigned to esketamine treatment dropped out of trials more frequently than those assigned to placebo for any reason (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.73; n = 773, studies = 4,moderate-certainty evidence).

Data Sources: We searched PubMed, PsycINFO, and EMBASE for randomized trials of psychedelics in humans from 1940 through May 2020 with no language restrictions. PRISMA guidelines were followed. (PROSPERO registration number: PROSPERO-CRD42020205341.). Study Selection: All randomized trials of psychedelics in humans from 1940 through May 2020 were included. Data Extraction: Two independent reviewers performed extraction. Extracted data included study design, demographics, blinding type, whether and how blind integrity was assessed, psychedelic used and dose, drug control condition and dose, type of non-drug control condition, number of dosing sessions, and recruitment source. Outcome data were not collected. Results: In total, 126 articles were included, encompassing 86 unique studies. Of studies with a drug control condition (80), 49 (61.2%) used an inert placebo control, 16 (20.0%) used active comparators, 12 (15.0%) used both, and 3 (3.8%) used only different active psychedelic doses as a control. Only 3 of 21 therapeutic trials compared the use of psychological support to a minimally supportive condition. The majority (81/86; 94%) of studies were blinded, though only 14 (17.3%) included blind assessment; only 8 of these 14 studies assessed participants' blinding. Blinding success, assessed in highly varied ways, was generally poor.

However, there has been only mixed support for this in the literature. The presence of polysubstance use is a confounding factor. The aim of this study was to investigate whether regular cannabis and/or regular methamphetamine use confers additional risk of poor mental health and high levels of psychological distress, beyond regular ecstasy use alone. Method: Three years of data from a yearly, cross-sectional, quantitative survey of Australian regular ecstasy users was examined. Participants were divided into four groups according to whether they regularly (at least monthly) used ecstasy only (n. =. 936), ecstasy and weekly cannabis (n. =. 697), ecstasy and weekly methamphetamine (n. =. 108) or ecstasy, weekly cannabis and weekly methamphetamine (n. =. 180).

Currently, there are no effective pharmacological treatments for cannabis use disorder. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this uncontrolled proof of concept trial was to test the feasibility, tolerability, and potential therapeutic effects of integrating ketamine infusions with a behavioral platform of motivational enhancement therapy and mindfulness-based relapse prevention in treating cannabis use disorder (CUD). METHODS: Eight cannabis-dependent individuals (four female, four male) receiving motivational enhancement therapy and mindfulness-based relapse prevention behavioral treatments completed this single-blind outpatient 6-week study. Participants received either one or two infusions of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg [infusion 1]; 1.41 mg/kg [infusion 2] for non-responders) during the study. Participants self-reported cannabis use (Timeline Follow-Back) and underwent an assessment of confidence in abstaining from using cannabis (Drug-Taking Confidence Questionnaire) at predetermined time points throughout the study. RESULTS: Ketamine infusions were well-tolerated and there were no adverse events.

Although anecdotal reports claim multiple benefits associated with this practice, the lack of placebo-controlled studies severely limits our knowledge of microdosing and its effects. Moreover, research conducted in standard laboratory settings could fail to capture the motivation of individuals engaged or planning to engage in microdosing protocols, thus underestimating the likelihood of positive effects on creativity and cognitive function. We recruited 34 individuals starting to microdose with psilocybin mushrooms (Psilocybe cubensis), one of the materials most frequently used for this purpose. Following a double-blind placebo-controlled experimental design, we investigated the acute and short-term effects of 0.5 g of dried mushrooms on subjective experience, behavior, creativity (divergent and convergent thinking), perception, cognition, and brain activity. The reported acute effects were significantly more intense for the active dose compared to the placebo, but only for participants who correctly identified their experimental condition. These changes were accompanied by reduced EEG power in the theta band, together with preserved levels of Lempel-Ziv broadband signal complexity. For all other measurements there was no effect of microdosing except for few small changes towards cognitive impairment. According to our findings, low doses of psilocybin mushrooms can result in noticeable subjective effects and altered EEG rhythms, but without evidence to support enhanced well-being, creativity and cognitive function.

Music is considered integral to the administration of psychedelics and is used to provide support in altered states of consciousness [2]. Retrospectively reported experiences with music during psilocybin‐assisted antidepressant treatment have been associated with positive treatment outcome [3], suggesting that music contributes to clinical effects although the processes involved are not clear. Music can evoke a variety of emotions and previous experimental work with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) suggests that this emotional response may be enhanced by 5‐HT2AR agonism [4], implicating emotional processing as a synergetic interface between music and psychedelics. However, it is not known whether emotional response to music is enhanced with psilocybin or reduced by 5‐HT2AR antagonism. In this study we therefore sought to elucidate the effects of intervention with psilocybin as compared to intervention with the 5‐HT2AR antagonist ketanserin on emotional response to music. For this purpose, we chose an excerpt of the classical music program Positive Affect used to facilitate emotional experiences within traditional music therapy. Methods: We included 20 healthy individuals (10 women) with a mean age of 33 years (range: 24‐58) in this randomized (psilocybin or ketanserin first) cross‐over, single‐blinded study. Participants received 0.3mg/kg of psilocybin or 20mg of ketanserin (n=14) on two separate intervention days. At baseline and during the period of peak drug levels, participants listened to the music program and reported their emotional response to the music immediately afterwards using the 9‐item Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) [5]. The music program included Edward Elgar, Enigma Variations no. 8 and 9 and Amadeus Mozart, Laudate Dominum (app. 10 minutes). Differences in GEMS total score between psilocybin and baseline (n=20), psilocybin and ketanserin (n=14), and ketanserin and baseline (n=14) were evaluated using paired‐samples t‐tests. Effect sizes are reported with Hedge's g and p‐values are corrected using the Bonferroni‐Holm method.

Potential treatments for conditions characterized by these symptoms may require enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. A novel class of compounds‐positive allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor (NMDA‐PAMs)‐are being developed for this purpose. The clinical development path for compounds with novel mechanisms of action is substantially de‐risked by characterizing functional CNS target engagement. Ketamine is a glutamate antagonist that has been shown to induce changes in brain activity via the NMDA receptor. Given this, a suite of Phase 1 target engagement studies was designed to evaluate CNS‐target engagement of SAGE‐718, an investigational NMDA‐PAM, by electrophysiology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a low‐dose ketamine challenge paradigm. Methods: Based on the hypothesis that an NMDA‐PAM would attenuate ketamine‐induced changes in healthy volunteers, a lowdose ketamine challenge paradigm was employed. Two paradigms were selected based on a single administration of SAGE‐718 (3mg oral solution) vs. placebo in a randomized cross‐over design, with a wash‐out of approximately 10 days. In the first study, subjects underwent MRI approximately 6.5 hours after the SAGE‐718 or placebo dose to obtain a baseline assessment. Ketamine (0.25mg/kg) was then administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes starting approximately 7 hours after each dose of SAGE‐718 or placebo. During the infusion, a second MRI assessment was completed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) derived changes of the blood oxygenation level (BOLD) response and functional connectivity between regions of interest were recorded (n = 13, completed subjects with valid data). In the second study to determine the effects of SAGE‐718 vs placebo, electrophysiological parameters were assessed starting approximately 6 hours after the administration of SAGE‐718 or placebo and approximately one hour before the administration of ketamine. A second assessment was done during the 60 min ketamine infusion. The following parameters were measured; ketamine‐induced changes in single click auditory evoked potential (AEP, N100‐P200), mismatch negativity (MMN), and auditory steady state response (ASSR) (n =18 completed subjects with valid data). Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale, Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Ketamine‐induced BOLD changes were broad, including robust increases in posterior brain regions and decreases in anterior brain regions, in particular the pre‐specified dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). SAGE‐718 attenuated ketamineinduced BOLD alterations independent of their directionality. N100‐P200 was significantly reduced by ketamine under placebo conditions (p < 0.05), but not after administration of SAGE‐718. No ketamine‐induced significant changes were observed for mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory steady state response (ASSR) under any condition. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration (but before ketamine administration) were mild and infrequent, including headache (n = 1 in each of the studies) and fatigue (n = 1) in the evoked potential study. No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718, and no significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Results from these studies demonstrate that SAGE‐718 had effects on functional imaging in healthy volunteers.

Current inpatient hospitalization lengths of stay do not offer the time needed to implement such interventions. The current treatment protocol for people in acute phases of schizophrenia is psychopharmacological; however, high rates of medication nonadherence and limited effects on negative symptomatology suggest the need for complementary psychosocial treatment options. The purpose of this study was to determine: feasibility of protocol completion, feasibility of measurement sensitivity, and the effects of a single‐session DMT intervention compared to a single‐session verbal treatment as usual (TAU) intervention. Methods: This mixed methods feasibility study utilized a convergent mixed methods feasibility design. Qualitative and quantitative data were collected simultaneously in a single phase from the experimental and control groups. In this study, the quantitative strand was prioritized and constituted most of the data collection. A qualitative strand was added to enhance the understanding of participants' experiences of the intervention and control conditions. Thirty‐two participants were randomized to a 45‐minute DMT session or a 45‐minute verbal TAU session. Quantitative data were collected using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, and qualitative data through semistructured interviews. Results: indicated that participants in the DMT intervention group had statistically significant symptom reduction versus those in the TAU group in overall BPRS scores (p < 0.001), Psychological Discomfort (p < 0.001), Negative Symptoms (p = 0.007), and Positive Symptoms (p = 0.003).

Traditional interventions encompass pharmaceutical and psychological treatments. Unconventional therapies, like MDMA, offer hope for sexual dysfunction. This review delves into MDMA's effects on sexual responsiveness and its potential role in treating sexual dysfunction. OBJECTIVES: The purpose of this review is to elucidate effects of MDMA on different domains of the female and male sexual response cycles. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review on the effects of MDMA on each domain of the female and male sexual response cycles. PubMed, MEDLINE, and EMBASE were queried, and results were screened using PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Search terms utilized were \"MDMA\" or \"ecstasy\" in combination with \"desire,\" \"arousal,\" \"lubrication,\" \"orgasm,\" \"pleasure,\" \"libido,\" \"erection,\" and \"ejaculation.\" Inclusion criteria for this review were MDMA use by study subjects and sexual outcomes in at least 1 domain of the female and/or male sexual response cycles were described and measured.

RESULTS: We identified 181 studies, of which 6 met criteria for assessment of the female sexual response cycle and 8 met criteria for assessment of the male sexual response cycle. Four of 6 studies reported increased sexual desire with MDMA use among women. Arousal and lubrication were improved with MDMA use in 3 of 4 studies, but they were not affected in 1 randomized control study. In men, 7 studies evaluated the effects of MDMA on desire and/or arousal, 5 studies measured impact on erection, 3 on orgasm, and 2 on ejaculation. Sixty percent of interview-based studies reported increased sexual desire in men, while 40% reported mixed or no effect. Two studies reported impairment of erection, 2 reported mixed effects, and 1 reported fear of erection impairment. In both men and women, all studies evaluating orgasm reported delay in achieving orgasm but increased intensity and pleasure if achieved. Primary outcome measures were variable and largely qualitative. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggest that MDMA generally increases sexual desire and intensifies orgasm when achieved.

This study updates the cost-effectiveness analysis of this novel therapy using data from a new phase 3 trial, including the incremental cost-effectiveness of the more intensive phase 3 regimen compared with the shorter phase 2 regimen. METHODS: We adapted a previously-published Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of providing MDMA-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) to patients with chronic, severe, or extreme PTSD in a recent phase 3 trial, compared with standard care.

In a recent suite of target‐engagement studies, SAGE‐718, an investigational positive allosteric modulator of the NMDA receptor, demonstrated effects on electrophysiological and functional imaging biomarkers in healthy volunteers after a low dose ketamine challenge. These findings are consistent with CNS penetrance and functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. Here, the effects of 10‐day repeated exposure of SAGE‐718 on a core cognitive battery were investigated in healthy volunteers. Methods: Forty subjects were randomized (1:1) to either multiple oral doses of SAGE‐718 (n = 19) plus ketamine or placebo (n = 21) plus ketamine, which was delivered in a double‐blinded manner [SAGE‐718: n = 19, mean (SD) age 42.7 (12.00) years, 15.8% female; Placebo: n = 21, mean (SD) age 42.6 (11.56) years, 15.4% female]. SAGE‐718 oral solution or matching placebo solution was administered as a 1.0‐mg dose in a fasted condition once daily (between 7 and 10 AM) over the course of 10 days. Blood samples were taken and processed for pharmacokinetic analysis of concentrations of SAGE‐718. Plasma samples were used to calculate Cmax as well as other PK parameters. Computerized testing was used to measure performance on key cognitive domains, including attention, working memory, processing speed, executive function, and motor reaction time. Assessments included computerized versions of the International Shopping List Test (verbal learning), International Shopping List Test‐Delayed Recall (memory), Groton Maze Learning Test (executive function), Social Emotional Cognition Test (emotional cognition), Detection Test (psychomotor function), Identification Test (attention), One Back Test (working memory), Two Back Test (higher‐order working memory), Stop Signal Reaction Test (inhibition), and the Continuous Paired Associate Learning Test (paired associated learning). A mixed‐effect regression model analysis (MMRM) was applied, with change from baseline in each cognitive test score as the response variable, and treatment, visit, and visit‐by‐treatment interaction as fixed effects, baseline as a covariate, and measurements within the same subject as repeated measure. Unstructured covariance structure was applied for the repeated measure. Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociate State Scale, the Observers Assessment of Alertness/Sedation Scale, and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: As compared to placebo, statistically significant improvements were observed in the Two‐Back Test at days 2, 4 and 8 of testing (p < 0.05). Compared to placebo, statistically significant improvement was observed on the Groton Maze Test at day 6 of testing (p < 0.05). A dose‐response relationship was observed for the Two‐Back Test, with Cmax positively correlated with an increase in change from baseline performance on the Two‐Back Test (p = 0.02). A similar trend was observed for the Groton Maze Test (Cmax vs change from baseline, p = 0.06). SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths observed in the trial subjects. The most frequent treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration were mild and numerically similar to those seen with placebo (TEAE: SAGE‐718, n = 6 (31.6%); placebo, n = 7 (33.3%)). No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718. No significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Healthy volunteers dosed with SAGE‐718 exhibited greater improvement on tests of higher‐order working memory (Two‐Back Test) and complex problem solving (Groton Maze Test), which at times reached the threshold for statistical significance as compared to subjects receiving placebo. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated by the trial subjects over 10 days of exposure.

Herein, we synthesize extant long-term studies (≥ 4 weeks) regarding this treatment. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: The interventional studies of IN esketamine in patients with depression having a study period of at least four weeks were included for our synthesis. A meta-analysis was undertaken for the efficacy and safety parameters of adjunctive IN esketamine vs IN placebo with an oral antidepressant. The data excluded from meta-analysis were synthesized narratively.

METHODS: This was a double-blind, psychoactive-controlled ascending dose study in 12 patients with treatment-resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders who were not currently depressed. Ascending doses of ketamine (0.25, 0.5, 1 mg/kg) were administered at weekly intervals, and midazolam 0.01 mg/kg, the control, was randomly inserted into the ketamine dose sequence. Assessments included ratings of anxiety and dissociation, safety and tolerability, and blood samples for ketamine pharmacokinetics and BDNF concentrations. RESULTS: Improvements in anxiety ratings occurred within an hour of ketamine dosing, and persisted for up to 1 week. A dose-response profile was noted for anxiolytic effects, dissociative side effects, and changes in blood pressure and heart rate after ketamine dosing. Midazolam had minor brief effects on anxiety ratings. Ketamine was safe and well tolerated. Ketamine pharmacokinetics were correlated with dissociation ratings.

Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms.

Previous research has examined cognitive performance after a period of prolonged abstinence, but research assessing the early effects of ecstasy after recent use is limited despite temporal neurochemical differences demonstrated in nonhuman models. METHODS: This study compared task performance between 13 ecstasy users (10 to 15 h postdrug use) and a control group on a battery of neuropsychologic assessments while matching for education level, sleep deprivation, and premorbid IQ. The groups were also compared on measures relating to parkinsonian signs. RESULTS: The ecstasy subjects showed impairments on measures of executive function as evaluated by Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices (SPM) and the Wisconsin Card Sorting Task (WCST). Short-delay free recall memory was also impaired in ecstasy subjects on the California Verbal Learning Test (CVLT-II). No extrapyramidal motor impairments were detected. CONCLUSIONS: These deficits resemble deficits previously reported in chronic ecstasy use but also seem to reveal transient impairments in executive function. Future research is needed to better understand the neurologic and neuropsychologic implications of ecstasy use across time and extent of use.", "doi": "10.1097/01.wnn.0000213909.41901.cc", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16957494/", "secondary_title": "Cogn Behav Neurol", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

In this secondary analysis, the primary outcome measures of suicidal ideation (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale [C-SSRS] and the Suicide Item of the 28-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS₂₈-SI]) were assessed at 240 minutes postinfusion and for 3 months thereafter in a naturalistic follow-up. RESULTS: Over the course of the infusions (acute treatment phase), 7 of 14 patients (50%) showed remission of suicidal ideation on the C-SSRS Ideation scale (even among patients whose depression did not remit). There was a significant linear decrease in this score over time (P < .001), which approached significance even after controlling for severity of 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS₆) core depression items (P = .05). Similarly, there were significant decreases in the C-SSRS Intensity (P < .01) and HDRS₂₈-SI (P < .001) scores during the acute treatment phase. Two of the 7 patients who achieved remission during the acute treatment phase (29%) maintained their remission throughout a 3-month naturalistic follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In this preliminary study, repeated doses of open-label ketamine rapidly and robustly decreased suicidal ideation in pharmacologically treated outpatients with treatment-resistant depression with stable suicidal thoughts; this decrease was maintained for at least 3 months following the final ketamine infusion in 2 patients.

We previously reported the rapid OCD symptom reduction of ketamine, a glutamate Nmethyl‐ d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, versus saline infusions in a proof‐of‐concept crossover trial (n = 15) in unmedicated adults with OCD. Building on this initial finding, we evaluated the efficacy of ketamine in a larger group of unmedicated OCD patients with improved control conditions (active placebo control condition). Methods: This was a randomized controlled trial of a single infusion of ketamine compared to an active placebo condition (midazolam, an anesthetic). With institutional review board approval, unmedicated adult patients (age 18‐65) with OCD were randomly assigned under double‐blind conditions to receive a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) in a 2:1 ratio (total n = 45). Participants met DSM‐5 criteria for OCD with at least moderate symptoms (Yale‐Brown Obsessive Compulsive Rating Scale score of at least 16).

Psilocybin has risen to prominence as one of the most studied among these psychedelic compounds. Multiple trials have already shown that it can be a safe and efficacious treatment for various medical conditions. This study intends to perform a meta-analysis of data reported in clinical trials studying psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety. Methods: Articles were searched, screened, and ultimately selected using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was collected from commonly used psychometric tests that measured mood and anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated by comparing scores in these tests at baseline and control to experimental groups. Sub-group analysis was performed to assess psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety during short, medium, and long-term time frames. Results: Statistical significance was achieved in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to controls in multiple subgroups.

Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions.

Its psychotherapies often involve delayed treatment-response times, while its pharmacotherapies can cause unwanted side effects. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in psychedelic research with a specific interest in the potential of psilocybin for treating MDD. Therefore, this systematic review was performed to evaluate the effectiveness of psilocybin therapy at moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) to high (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg) doses in the psychiatric treatment of MDD. Methods: The review included a literature search using PubMed (Medline), SCOPUS, Web of Science, and Medline (Ovid) databases from January 1, 2013, to February 28, 2023. Seven studies were included following the inclusion and exclusion criteria (e.g., moderate to high dosing psilocybin treatment, peer-reviewed, moderate to severe depression, control/delayed treatment groups, and non-directive therapy during psilocybin sessions). Studies were excluded using PRISMA guidelines and appraised using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme checklists. Results: The primary outcomes assessed included changes in depression scores on validated diagnostic tools and secondary outcomes that supported depression remission (e.g., improved well-being and rumination scores, and decreased anxiety scores). Psilocybin was found to reduce depression symptoms in moderate single-dose contexts and have minimal reported side effects at high doses. A positive relationship was observed between the quality of psilocybin-induced experiences and the reduction in depressive symptoms. Additionally, a dose-response relationship was found between moderate (15±5 mg/70 kg) and high-dose psilocybin (25 ± 5 mg/70 kg), with greater improvements generally seen in higher dose conditions. Discussion: This review suggests that psilocybin can be an effective treatment option for MDD. Psilocybin shows meaningful improvements in depression scores with the potential to treat psychiatric conditions concurrent to depression. The non-directive therapy approach during high-dose sessions enabled unique psychedelic and personal experiences, potentially allowing more profound and individualized therapy. Reported side effects were minimal, and suggestions for future studies are provided. Conclusion: Psilocybin therapy was found to reduce depression levels and improve secondary outcomes that support depression remission, indicating efficacy for MDD and other depressive conditions.

Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted.

Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events.

The combined GHB group had a longer time to complete recovery of consciousness (71±40 vs 59±40 min, p<0.001) and a higher percentage of patients with severely reduced consciousness at ED arrival (54% vs 37%, p=0.01), need for treatment (29% vs 16%, p<0.01) and need for mechanical ventilation (3% vs 0%, p<0.05) compared with the pure GHB group. Conclusions: GHB intoxication leading to reduced consciousness is a frequent reason for ED admission, above all in young people and in the early morning at the weekend. Symptoms are more severe in patients who have taken GHB in combination with other substances of abuse.", "doi": "10.1136/emj.2008.068403", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21602168/", "secondary_title": "Emergency Medicine Journal", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Recent findings have suggested that psychedelic drugs may have a role in the treatment of depressive symptoms, and a number of groups are in the process of developing protocols to study this question systematically. Given the subjective quality of both the psychedelic experience and depressive symptomatology, great care must be taken when designing a protocol to study the clinical efficacy of psychedelic drugs.

Conclusions: Careful and transparent study design and data analysis will maximize the likelihood of generating meaningful, reproducible results, and identifying a treatment-specific effect. Meeting the highest standards for contemporary trial design may also broaden the acceptance of psychedelic research in the scientific community at large.

METHOD: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients with mood and anxiety spectrum disorders who presented with clinically significant SI (n = 24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. SI measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 h post-treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary outcomes included the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale--Suicidal Ideation (MADRS-SI) score at 24 h and additional measures beyond the 24-h time-point. RESULTS: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7-day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 h (p = 0.32); however, a significant difference emerged at 48 h (p = 0.047). MADRS-SI score was lower in the ketamine group compared to midazolam group at 24 h (p = 0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7-day assessment period. CONCLUSIONS: The current findings provide initial support for the safety and tolerability of ketamine as an intervention for SI in patients who are at elevated risk for suicidal behavior. Larger, well-powered studies are warranted.", "doi": "10.1017/s0033291715001506", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26266877/", "secondary_title": "Psychol Med", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

MDMA, an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor, affects the serotonin and dopamine systems.

Acute administration leads to neurophysiological modifications in brain regions of the default mode network, purportedly through a glutamatergic mechanism. Post-acutely, ayahuasca potentiates mindfulness capacities in volunteers and induces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients. However, the mechanisms underlying these fast and maintained effects are poorly understood. Here, we investigated in an open-label uncontrolled study in 16 healthy volunteers ayahuasca-induced post-acute neurometabolic and connectivity modifications and their association with mindfulness measures. METHODS: Using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional connectivity, we compared baseline and post-acute neurometabolites and seed-to-voxel connectivity in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex after a single ayahuasca dose. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed post-acute reductions in glutamate+glutamine, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the posterior cingulate cortex. Connectivity was increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures in the right medial temporal lobe. Glutamate+glutamine reductions correlated with increases in the \"nonjudging\" subscale of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Increased anterior cingulate cortex-medial temporal lobe connectivity correlated with increased scores on the self-compassion questionnaire. Post-acute neural changes predicted sustained elevations in nonjudging 2 months later. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics in humans. They further suggest that neurometabolic changes in the posterior cingulate cortex, a key region within the default mode network, and increased connectivity between the anterior cingulate cortex and medial temporal lobe structures involved in emotion and memory potentially underlie the post-acute psychological effects of ayahuasca.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyx036", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28525587/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

Here, we investigated in an open-label uncontrolled study in 16 healthy volunteers ayahuasca-induced post-acute neurometabolic and connectivity modifications and their association with mindfulness measures. METHODS: Using 1H-magnetic resonance spectroscopy and functional connectivity, we compared baseline and post-acute neurometabolites and seed-to-voxel connectivity in the posterior and anterior cingulate cortex after a single ayahuasca dose. RESULTS: Magnetic resonance spectroscopy showed post-acute reductions in glutamate+glutamine, creatine, and N-acetylaspartate+N-acetylaspartylglutamate in the posterior cingulate cortex. Connectivity was increased between the posterior cingulate cortex and the anterior cingulate cortex, and between the anterior cingulate cortex and limbic structures in the right medial temporal lobe. Glutamate+glutamine reductions correlated with increases in the \"nonjudging\" subscale of the Five Facets Mindfulness Questionnaire. Increased anterior cingulate cortex-medial temporal lobe connectivity correlated with increased scores on the self-compassion questionnaire. Post-acute neural changes predicted sustained elevations in nonjudging 2 months later. CONCLUSIONS: These results support the involvement of glutamate neurotransmission in the effects of psychedelics in humans.

We recruited 37 male and female participants with remitted depression who were free from symptoms and antidepressant treatments at the time of the scan. Participants were scanned 2 hours after drug administration in a double-blind crossover design (ketamine: 0.5 mg/kg and placebo) while performing a monetary reward task. RESULTS: A significant main effect of ketamine was observed across all regions of interest during the anticipation and feedback phases of win and no-win trials. The drug effects were particularly prominent in the nucleus accumbens and putamen, which showed increased activation on the receipt of smaller rewards compared with neutral. The levels of (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine 2 hours after infusion significantly correlated with the activation observed in the ventral tegmental area for that contrast. CONCLUSIONS: These findings demonstrate that ketamine can produce detectable changes in reward-related brain areas 2 hours after infusion, which occur without symptom changes and support the idea that ketamine might improve reward-related symptoms via modulation of response to feedback.", "doi": "10.1016/j.bpsc.2021.05.009", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34126264/", "secondary_title": "Biol Psychiatry Cogn Neurosci Neuroimaging", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

This study was designed to test the opioid-induced hyperalgesia produced by remifentanil, and to evaluate the effect of ketamine under these conditions. Methods: Forty-seven ASA 1-2 patients undergoing lumbar disc operation were randomly assigned into 3 anaesthetic regimens. The patients were not premedicated. After standard anaesthesia induction with propofol and vecuronium, group R and group K patients received a remifentanil infusion of 0.1 μg kg-1 min-1. Group K also received 0.5 mg kg-1 ketamine bolus before remifentanil infusion. Group S was the control group and equal volume of saline instead of remifentanil was infused throughout the operation. Groups R and S also received a bolus of the same volume of saline instead of ketamine by an anaesthesiologist blinded to the study. After the surgery under desflurane anaesthesia, patient-controlled analgesia with morphine was used in the postoperative care unit. Effective analgesia time, total morphine consumption, and visual analogue pain scores were noted at 15 min intervals during the first hour. Results: Age, sex, weight and height of the patients were similar. Remifentanil infusion time and effective analgesia time were similar in all groups. A significant decrease of morphine use was noted in all groups. Additionally, the groups showed a significant difference in VAS. VAS values were significantly lower in group S than in groups K and R. These values were similar groups R and K. Conclusion: Remifentanil infusion of 0.1 μg min-1 causes opioid-induced hyperalgesia in lumbar disc operations in the early postoperative period.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-asparate antagonist, has been reported to have antidepressant effects within hours. We examined the effects of a single dose of ketamine on suicidal ideation in subjects with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Thirty-three subjects with DSM-IV-diagnosed MDD received a single open-label infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and were rated at baseline and at 40, 80, 120, and 230 minutes postinfusion with the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI), the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. The study was conducted between October 2006 and January 2009. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation scores decreased significantly on the SSI as well as on the suicide subscales of other rating instruments within 40 minutes; these decreases remained significant through the first 4 hours postinfusion (P < .001). Ten subjects (30%) had an SSI score ≥ 4 at baseline; all these scores dropped below 4 (9 dropped by 40 minutes and 1 by 80 minutes).

METHODS: Across four participating Canadian institutions, 240 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder experiencing a MDE are randomized (1:1) to a course of ECT or racemic IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered 3 times/week for 3 or 4 weeks.

This study protocol describes an ongoing multi-centre, prospective, randomized, crossover, non-inferiority trial comparing acute treatment of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) with ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on efficacy, speed of therapeutic effects, side effects, and health care resource utilization. A secondary aim is to compare a 6-month maintenance strategy for ketamine responders to standard of care ECT maintenance. Finally, through the measurement of clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and molecular markers we aim to establish predictors and moderators of treatment response as well as treatment-elicited effects on these outcomes. METHODS: Across four participating Canadian institutions, 240 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder experiencing a MDE are randomized (1:1) to a course of ECT or racemic IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered 3 times/week for 3 or 4 weeks. Non-responders (< 50% improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] scores) crossover to receive the alternate treatment. Responders during the randomization or crossover phases then enter the 6-month maintenance phase during which time they receive clinical assessments at identical intervals regardless of treatment arm. ECT maintenance follows standard of care while ketamine maintenance involves: weekly infusions for 1 month, then bi-weekly infusions for 2 months, and finally monthly infusions for 3 months (returning to bi-weekly in case of relapse). The primary outcome measure is change in MADRS scores after randomized treatment as assessed by raters blind to treatment modality. DISCUSSION: This multi-centre study will help identify molecular, imaging, and clinical characteristics of patients with treatment-resistant and/or severe MDEs who would benefit most from either type of therapeutic strategy. In addition to informing clinical practice and influencing health care delivery, this trial will add to the robust platform and database of CAN-BIND studies for future research and biomarker discovery.

Aim: The purpose of this study was to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Psychological Insight Questionnaire. Method: A cross-sectional survey study among psilocybin and LSD users. Respondents (n=1661; Mage=22.9, standard deviation=8.5; Caucasian/White=83%; non-Hispanic=91%; men=72%; United States resident=66%) completed an Internet-based survey. Results: The Psychological Insight Questionnaire consists of 23 items with two subscales: (a) Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights and (b) Goals and Adaptive Patterns Insights. Construct validity of the Psychological Insight Questionnaire was supported by strong correlations of the Psychological Insight Questionnaire (and Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights and Goals and Adaptive Patterns Insights subscales) scores with the insight subscale of the Session Impacts Scale, and weak-to-moderate correlations with the Mystical Experiences and Challenging Experiences Questionnaires. Furthermore, Psychological Insight Questionnaire (and Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights and Goals and Adaptive Patterns Insights subscales) scores were moderately-to-strongly correlated with retrospectively reported increases in psychological flexibility, and well-being/life satisfaction that were attributed to a memorable psychedelic experience. Lastly, incremental validity was established showing that the Psychological Insight Questionnaire (and Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights subscale) scores predict unique variance in changes in psychological flexibility, and Psychological Insight Questionnaire (and Avoidance and Maladaptive Patterns Insights and Goals and Adaptive Patterns Insights subscales) scores predict changes in well-being and life satisfaction, beyond measures of acute mystical-type and challenging effects.

The differences of least squares mean (SE) change from baseline between ketamine and placebo were ‐16.0 (3.74) for the 2X/wk group and ‐16.4 (2.40) for the 3X/wk group. During the double‐blind treatment phase, the most common (≥ 20% of patients) treatment‐emergent adverse events were headache, anxiety, dissociation, nausea, and dizziness. There were 2 non drug‐related serious adverse events (anxiety and suicide attempt) in the ketamine 2X/wk group. No death was reported. Conclusions: Ketamine dosed 2X/wk or 3X/wk demonstrated similar efficacy and significant changes in the MADRS total score from baseline to Day 15, and was generally well tolerated.", "doi": "10.1016/j.biopsych.2014.03.014", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38618649/", "secondary_title": "Biological psychiatry", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

However, the interaction between 5-HT2AR activation, cognitive impairments and visual hallucinations is still poorly understood. This study explored the effect of 5-HT2AR activation on response inhibition neural networks in healthy subjects by using LSD and further tested whether brain activation during response inhibition under LSD exposure was related to LSD-induced visual hallucinations. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, LSD (100 µg) and placebo were administered to 18 healthy subjects. Response inhibition was assessed using a functional magnetic resonance imaging Go/No-Go task. LSD-induced visual hallucinations were measured using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, LSD administration impaired inhibitory performance and reduced brain activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex and in the left superior frontal and postcentral gyrus and cerebellum.

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects.

Research with medium to high doses of psilocybin points towards potential underlying mechanisms, including the modulation of emotion and interoceptive processing. AIMS: In this preregistered study, we investigated whether psilocybin microdoses alter self-reported interoceptive awareness and whether repeated microdosing over 3 weeks modulates emotion processing and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire 1½ h after self-administering their second dose (or placebo), and the emotional go/no-go task and the shortened Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 1½ h after self-administering their seventh dose. RESULTS: Our confirmatory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect emotion processing or symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with placebo.

Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations. While these data are reassuring, it is important for each treatment case to fully explore potential cardiovascular risks prior to initiating treatment.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2021.549080", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33841195/", "secondary_title": "FRONTIERS IN PSYCHIATRY", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

The exact neurotoxic mechanisms of polydrug ecstasy and amphetamine use, however, remain speculative. © 2012 IBRO.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroscience.2012.06.049", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22750208/", "secondary_title": "Neuroscience", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether 2 administrations of high-dose psilocybin improve the percentage of heavy drinking days in patients with AUD undergoing psychotherapy relative to outcomes observed with active placebo medication and psychotherapy. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this double-blind randomized clinical trial, participants were offered 12 weeks of manualized psychotherapy and were randomly assigned to receive psilocybin vs diphenhydramine during 2 day-long medication sessions at weeks 4 and 8. Outcomes were assessed over the 32-week double-blind period following the first dose of study medication. The study was conducted at 2 academic centers in the US. Participants were recruited from the community between March 12, 2014, and March 19, 2020. Adults aged 25 to 65 years with a DSM-IV diagnosis of alcohol dependence and at least 4 heavy drinking days during the 30 days prior to screening were included. Exclusion criteria included major psychiatric and drug use disorders, hallucinogen use, medical conditions that contraindicated the study medications, use of exclusionary medications, and current treatment for AUD. INTERVENTIONS: Study medications were psilocybin, 25 mg/70 kg, vs diphenhydramine, 50 mg (first session), and psilocybin, 25-40 mg/70 kg, vs diphenhydramine, 50-100 mg (second session). Psychotherapy included motivational enhancement therapy and cognitive behavioral therapy. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome was percentage of heavy drinking days, assessed using a timeline followback interview, contrasted between groups over the 32-week period following the first administration of study medication using multivariate repeated-measures analysis of variance.

Specifically, psilocybin, a partial serotonin (5‐HT) 2A receptor agonist, has shown promising safety and efficacy results in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders (e.g. reviewed in Rucker et al., 2018; Mertens and Preller, 2021). While results from modern pilot studies on psilocybin in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders are promising, most of those trials lack randomization, double‐blinding, and a sufficient sample size. The use of double‐blinding and an appropriate placebo is particularly difficult in psychedelic trials, facing ethical issues as well as the problem of “expectation bias” and the risk of nocebo effects in patients in the comparator groups (Gründer and Mertens, in press). Accordingly, there is an immense need for additional, larger, well‐designed randomized‐controlled studies. Methods: Objectives: The phase 2 EPIsoDE‐Trial (NCT04670081) aims to investigate the efficacy and safety of a high psilocybin dose (25 mg, p.o.) administered in a psychotherapeutic context in treatment‐resistant major depression in a randomized‐controlled, bi‐centric, parallel‐group, double‐blind design. We expect significant and stable treatment responses after a high (25 mg) dose of psilocybin in comparison to placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) and a low/supposedly inactive control dose (5 mg psilocybin), while provoking only mild and transient adverse events (AE). As a secondary objective the effect of a second high dose six weeks after the first dose will be assessed. Exploratory objectives are aimed at identifying potential neurobiological and psychological therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin treatment. Methods: 144 patients (25 ‐ 65 years of age) diagnosed with treatment‐resistant major depression of moderate to severe degree will be enrolled in the study, all of which will receive two dosing sessions six weeks apart. Treatment‐resistance is defined as no improvement in depression despite two adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. After informed consent and potentially down‐titration of their antidepressant medication, patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms: 1) receiving placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) first, 25 mg psilocybin second; 2) receiving the presumably sub‐effective psilocybin dose (5 mg) first, the high dose (25 mg) second; 3a) receiving 25 mg psilocybin first, 5 mg psilocybin second; 3b) receiving the high psilocybin dose (25 mg) at both sessions. Dosing sessions will be accompanied by multiple psychotherapeutic preparation and integration sessions. The second dose takes place after assessment of the primary endpoint; the primary endpoint is treatment response, defined as a minimum of 50% reduction in symptoms as measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D), six weeks after the first dose. Results: ‐ Conclusions: The trial is currently being conducted at the Central Institute of Mental Health (sponsor) in Mannheim as well as the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charité Mitte. The trial design, including the randomization, double blinding and comparator conditions, will allow valid conclusions on the efficacy and safety of psilocybin treatment in major depression. The trial is funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF 01EN2006A and 01EN2006B); it has been approved by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (BfArM) and the responsible Ethics Committees.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-021-01237-6", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34857905/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

We expect significant and stable treatment responses after a high (25 mg) dose of psilocybin in comparison to placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) and a low/supposedly inactive control dose (5 mg psilocybin), while provoking only mild and transient adverse events (AE). As a secondary objective the effect of a second high dose six weeks after the first dose will be assessed. Exploratory objectives are aimed at identifying potential neurobiological and psychological therapeutic mechanisms of psilocybin treatment. Methods: 144 patients (25 ‐ 65 years of age) diagnosed with treatment‐resistant major depression of moderate to severe degree will be enrolled in the study, all of which will receive two dosing sessions six weeks apart. Treatment‐resistance is defined as no improvement in depression despite two adequate courses of antidepressant treatment. After informed consent and potentially down‐titration of their antidepressant medication, patients will be randomized to one of four treatment arms: 1) receiving placebo (100 mg nicotinamide) first, 25 mg psilocybin second; 2) receiving the presumably sub‐effective psilocybin dose (5 mg) first, the high dose (25 mg) second; 3a) receiving 25 mg psilocybin first, 5 mg psilocybin second; 3b) receiving the high psilocybin dose (25 mg) at both sessions. Dosing sessions will be accompanied by multiple psychotherapeutic preparation and integration sessions. The second dose takes place after assessment of the primary endpoint; the primary endpoint is treatment response, defined as a minimum of 50% reduction in symptoms as measured with the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAM‐D), six weeks after the first dose. Results: ‐ Conclusions: The trial is currently being conducted at the Central Institute of Mental Health (sponsor) in Mannheim as well as the Charité Universitätsmedizin Berlin, Campus Charité Mitte. The trial design, including the randomization, double blinding and comparator conditions, will allow valid conclusions on the efficacy and safety of psilocybin treatment in major depression.

Specifically, psilocybin, a partial serotonin (5‐HT) 2A receptor agonist, has shown promising safety and efficacy results in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders (e.g. reviewed in Rucker et al., 2018; Mertens and Preller, 2021). While results from modern pilot studies on psilocybin in the treatment of major depression and other psychiatric disorders are promising, most of those trials lack randomization, double‐blinding, and a sufficient sample size. The use of double‐blinding and an appropriate placebo is particularly difficult in psychedelic trials, facing ethical issues as well as the problem of “expectation bias” and the risk of nocebo effects in patients in the comparator groups (Gründer and Mertens, in press). Accordingly, there is an immense need for additional, larger, well‐designed randomized‐controlled studies.

The MRI studies of psilocybin (both ASL and fMRI) revealed unexpected reduction in brain blood flow and a decrease in BOLD signal (Carhart‐Harris et al 2013 PNAS) in high‐level cortical regions and the thalamus, with post‐hoc analysis showing large increases in brain connectivity between, rather than within, the usual resting state networks (Petri et al J Roy Soc 2014). The cortical psilocybin MRI findings were confirmed by a later MEG study that revealed a major loss of power in all measured frequency bands (1‐100Hz) after psilocybin with decreases in alpha power in the posterior cingulate cortex correlating with egodissolution measures (Carhart‐Harris and Muthukumaraswamy et al 2013 J Neurosci). Results from the fMRI and MEG work suggested psilocybin has antidepressant properties and from these we are now conducting the first study of psilocybin in resistant depression. Data from a pilot phase will be ready for the ACNP meeting. MDMA also decreased blood flow and BOLD signal but the effects were largely subcortical, particularly in the amygdala, and no psychedelic effects were seen (Carhart‐Harris et al 2014 Biol Psych). Negative memories were attenuated and positive ones enhanced by MDMA and these effects were associated with fMRI‐measured changes in brain activity (Carhart‐Harris et al 2013 Int Neuropychopharm). LSD is the prototypical hallucinogen, with much greater use than the others in psychiatric and research settings, with over 1000 papers published before it was banned in 1967. Since then, and only in the past year, there have been 3 research reports, but none using modern brain imaging methods. Methods: Over the course of 6 hours, 20 healthy volunteers were scanned sequentially with ASL/BOLD‐fMRI/ and MEG following 75 microgm LSD iv or saline placebo in a crossover design at least 2 weeks apart. Subjective ratings of psychedelic experiences were then correlated with the imaging data. Twelve patients with resistant depression were treated with two sessions of psilocybin. Significant improvements in symptom severity were observed for up to 5 weeks post‐treatment, with a far greater before and (1 week) after treatment effect size (Cohen's d = 3.4) than seen with currently available anti‐depressant interventions. Results: LSD decreased integrity and segregation of brain networks and this effect correlated with subjective ratings of changes in consciousness, including ego‐dissolution. Increased functional connectivity between the visual cortex and high‐level cortical regions correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations. Patients treated with psilocybin for resistant depression have shown marked improvements in the symptom severity post‐treatment. Conclusions: The LSD data and our three prior psilocybin studies show that 5HT2A agonist hallucinogens provoke profound changes in consciousness due to decreased integrity of brain networks and a decrease in betweennetwork segregation found in resting state measures, leading to a more chaotic or “entropic” brain state. These effects may also explain the utility of these drugs in addiction and mood disorders.

The MRI studies of psilocybin (both ASL and fMRI) revealed unexpected reduction in brain blood flow and a decrease in BOLD signal (Carhart‐Harris et al 2013 PNAS) in high‐level cortical regions and the thalamus, with post‐hoc analysis showing large increases in brain connectivity between, rather than within, the usual resting state networks (Petri et al J Roy Soc 2014). The cortical psilocybin MRI findings were confirmed by a later MEG study that revealed a major loss of power in all measured frequency bands (1‐100Hz) after psilocybin with decreases in alpha power in the posterior cingulate cortex correlating with egodissolution measures (Carhart‐Harris and Muthukumaraswamy et al 2013 J Neurosci). Results from the fMRI and MEG work suggested psilocybin has antidepressant properties and from these we are now conducting the first study of psilocybin in resistant depression. Data from a pilot phase will be ready for the ACNP meeting. MDMA also decreased blood flow and BOLD signal but the effects were largely subcortical, particularly in the amygdala, and no psychedelic effects were seen (Carhart‐Harris et al 2014 Biol Psych). Negative memories were attenuated and positive ones enhanced by MDMA and these effects were associated with fMRI‐measured changes in brain activity (Carhart‐Harris et al 2013 Int Neuropychopharm). LSD is the prototypical hallucinogen, with much greater use than the others in psychiatric and research settings, with over 1000 papers published before it was banned in 1967. Since then, and only in the past year, there have been 3 research reports, but none using modern brain imaging methods. Methods: Over the course of 6 hours, 20 healthy volunteers were scanned sequentially with ASL/BOLD‐fMRI/ and MEG following 75 microgm LSD iv or saline placebo in a crossover design at least 2 weeks apart. Subjective ratings of psychedelic experiences were then correlated with the imaging data. Twelve patients with resistant depression were treated with two sessions of psilocybin. Significant improvements in symptom severity were observed for up to 5 weeks post‐treatment, with a far greater before and (1 week) after treatment effect size (Cohen's d = 3.4) than seen with currently available anti‐depressant interventions. Results: LSD decreased integrity and segregation of brain networks and this effect correlated with subjective ratings of changes in consciousness, including ego‐dissolution. Increased functional connectivity between the visual cortex and high‐level cortical regions correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations. Patients treated with psilocybin for resistant depression have shown marked improvements in the symptom severity post‐treatment. Conclusions: The LSD data and our three prior psilocybin studies show that 5HT2A agonist hallucinogens provoke profound changes in consciousness due to decreased integrity of brain networks and a decrease in betweennetwork segregation found in resting state measures, leading to a more chaotic or “entropic” brain state. These effects may also explain the utility of these drugs in addiction and mood disorders.
