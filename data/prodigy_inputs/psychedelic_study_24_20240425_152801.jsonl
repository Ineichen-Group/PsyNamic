Findings from such studies may be relevant to implement specific interventions for treatment. The aim of this study was to examine the association between resting-state regional brain metabolism (measured with 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose Positron Emission Tomography (FDG-PET) and the severity of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis in a sample of polysubstance users with prolonged abstinence from all drugs used.

We conducted correlation analyses between estimates of use of cocaine, heroin, alcohol, MDMA and cannabis and brain metabolism (BM) (using Statistical Parametric Mapping voxel-based (VB) whole-brain analyses).

Statistical heterogeneity was minimised by using a random-effects model throughout and investigated using study-level regression analysis (metaregression). RESULTS: Five Level I syntheses were identified; for each it was difficult to ascertain the exact methods adopted and evidence included. Small but significant deficits for ecstasy users compared to controls were reported in areas relating to attention, memory, psychomotor speed, executive systems functioning, and self-reported depressive symptoms. Data from Level II studies were directly pooled for seven individual outcomes, suggesting that ecstasy users performed worse than controls on common measures of immediate and delayed verbal recall (RAVLT, RBMT, digit span). No difference was seen in IQ (NART). The 915 outcome measures identified in Level II studies were analysed in broad domains: immediate and delayed verbal and visual memory, working memory, two measures of attention, three measures of executive function, perceptual organisation, self-rated depression, memory and anxiety, and impulsivity measured objectively and subjectively. Ecstasy users performed significantly worse than polydrug controls in 13/16 domains and significantly worse than drug-naïve controls in 7/12 domains for which sufficient data were available.

Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year.

Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms.

Former ecstasy users frequently showed deficits that matched or exceeded those seen amongst current users. At aggregate level, the effects do not appear to be dose-related, but are variably confounded by other drug use, particularly alcohol. Of Level III evidence, in the 10 years to 2006, the np-SAD and the GMR recorded an average of around 50 drug-related deaths per year involving ecstasy; it was the sole drug implicated in around 10 cases per year. Retrospective case series, based on hospital emergency department records, reported a death rate of 0-2% from emergency admissions related to ecstasy. Two major syndromes are most commonly reported as the immediate cause of death in fatal cases: hyperthermia and hyponatraemia. CONCLUSIONS: A broad range of relatively low-quality literature suggests that recreational use of ecstasy is associated with significant deficits in neurocognitive function (particularly immediate and delayed verbal memory) and increased psychopathological symptoms. The clinical significance of the exposure effect in individual cases will be variable but, on average, deficits are likely to be relatively small. Ecstasy is associated with a range of acute harms but appears to be a rare cause of death in isolation.", "doi": "10.3310/hta13050", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19195429/", "secondary_title": "Health Technol Assess", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Riluzole also did not delay relapse in ketamine responders, which is consistent with a prior report of lack of efficacy in 14 ketamine responders (Mathew et al., 2010). However, as riluzole has been proposed to have adjunctive antidepressant effects in TRD, and, although glutamatergic, its mechanism of action is distinct from ketamine's, we hypothesized that riluzole has antidepressant effects in ketamine non‐responders. Methods: 52 TRD inpatients in a current major depressive episode of at least moderate depression severity [Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score ≥22 at screening and the day of infusion) received a single open‐label subanesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40 minutes. 4‐6 hours post‐infusion, subjects were randomized double‐blind to either flexible‐dose (100‐200mg/day) riluzole or placebo twice daily for four weeks. Dose escalations were allowed on a weekly basis, and dose reductions were permitted by one capsule (50mg/week to a minimum of 100mg/day) for intolerable side effects. The MADRS is reported here as change in total score was the primary outcome measure. Responders and non‐responders were defined as ≥50% and<50% improvement, respectively, from baseline MADRS at 230 minutes (last pre‐randomization time point). Factorial linear mixed models with restricted maximum likelihood estimation and an autoregressive moving average covariance structure were used to examine change in MADRS with time as a within‐subjects factor and drug as a between‐subjects factor. MADRS score at 230 minutes was included as a covariate. All potential interactions between time and drug were included in the model. Results: At 230 minutes post‐infusion, 32 patients were non‐responders, and 16 non‐responders were randomized to each arm. There were no significant differences in demographic or neuropsychiatric characteristics (including length of illness, length of current episode and number of failed antidepressant trials) between groups. The linear mixed model showed no main effect of drug [F(1,29)=0.62, p=.44] or time [F(27,231)=1.50, p=.058]. There was also no interaction between drug and time [F(27,231)=1.15, p=.29]. This small sample size, however, may leave the study underpowered to detect a small‐to‐medium effect. In non‐responders, riluzole's maximum effect was observed at day one (d=.39) but was lost by day six. Yet, at the end of protocol, sample sizes were even smaller due to attrition ‐ placebo: 8/16 (50%) drop‐outs; riluzole: 6/16 (38%) dropouts. There was no statistically significant difference in drop‐outs between groups (p=.72), and, with the exception of one patient randomized to riluzole who discontinued due to severe nausea, the remaining drop‐outs were attributed to psychiatric indications, i.e. continued poor and/or worsening mood, anxiety or suicidal ideation. At day 28, there was only one antidepressant responder randomized to placebo (6%) and no responders randomized to riluzole (drop‐outs were counted as non‐responders). Conclusions: Although potentially underpowered to detect a small‐to‐moderate‐sized effect, riluzole is unlikely to be an effective antidepressant medication for ketamine nonresponders.

These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects.

METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years.
