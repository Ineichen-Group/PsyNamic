Although acute subjective effects of LSD are mostly positive, negative subjective effects, including anxiety, may occur. The induction of overall positive acute subjective effects is desired in psychedelic-assisted therapy because positive acute experiences are associated with greater therapeutic long-term benefits. 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces marked positive subjective effects and is used recreationally with LSD, known as \"candyflipping.\" The present study investigated whether the co-administration of MDMA can be used to augment acute subjective effects of LSD. We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design with 24 healthy subjects (12 women, 12 men) to compare the co-administration of MDMA (100\u2009mg) and LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g) with MDMA and LSD administration alone and placebo. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and endocrine effects and pharmacokinetics. MDMA co-administration with LSD did not change the quality of acute subjective effects compared with LSD alone. However, acute subjective effects lasted longer after LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA co-administration compared with LSD and MDMA alone, consistent with higher plasma concentrations of LSD (C(max) and area under the curve) and a longer plasma elimination half-life of LSD when MDMA was co-administered. The LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA combination increased blood pressure, heart rate, and pupil size more than LSD alone. Both MDMA alone and the LSD\u2009+\u2009MDMA combination increased oxytocin levels more than LSD alone. Overall, the co-administration of MDMA (100\u2009mg) did not improve acute effects or the safety profile of LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g). The combined use of MDMA and LSD is unlikely to provide relevant benefits over LSD alone in psychedelic-assisted therapy. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04516902."}

METHODS: In a phase 2, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial involving patients with long-standing, moderate-to-severe major depressive disorder, we compared psilocybin with escitalopram, a selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor, over a 6-week period. Patients were assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive two separate doses of 25 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily placebo (psilocybin group) or two separate doses of 1 mg of psilocybin 3 weeks apart plus 6 weeks of daily oral escitalopram (escitalopram group); all the patients received psychological support. The primary outcome was the change from baseline in the score on the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR-16; scores range from 0 to 27, with higher scores indicating greater depression) at week 6. There were 16 secondary outcomes, including QIDS-SR-16 response (defined as a reduction in score of >50%) and QIDS-SR-16 remission (defined as a score of \u22645) at week 6. RESULTS: A total of 59 patients were enrolled; 30 were assigned to the psilocybin group and 29 to the escitalopram group. The mean scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at baseline were 14.5 in the psilocybin group and 16.4 in the escitalopram group. The mean (\u00b1SE) changes in the scores from baseline to week 6 were -8.0\u00b11.0 points in the psilocybin group and -6.0\u00b11.0 in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 2.0 points (95% confidence interval [CI], -5.0 to 0.9) (P\u2009=\u20090.17). A QIDS-SR-16 response occurred in 70% of the patients in the psilocybin group and in 48% of those in the escitalopram group, for a between-group difference of 22 percentage points (95% CI, -3 to 48); QIDS-SR-16 remission occurred in 57% and 28%, respectively, for a between-group difference of 28 percentage points (95% CI, 2 to 54). Other secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses were not corrected for multiple comparisons. The incidence of adverse events was similar in the trial groups. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the change in depression scores on the QIDS-SR-16 at week 6, this trial did not show a significant difference in antidepressant effects between psilocybin and escitalopram in a selected group of patients. Secondary outcomes generally favored psilocybin over escitalopram, but the analyses of these outcomes lacked correction for multiple comparisons. Larger and longer trials are required to compare psilocybin with established antidepressants.

METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover study, LSD (200 \u03bcg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (8 women, 8 men).

RESULTS: Administration of LSD to healthy subjects produced pronounced alterations in waking consciousness that lasted 12 hours. The predominant effects induced by LSD included visual hallucinations, audiovisual synesthesia, and positively experienced derealization and depersonalization phenomena.

It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1\u20103] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double\u2010blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose\u2010response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross\u2010over design. Twenty\u2010four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33\u00b111 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29\u00b16 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic \u2010 pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively\u2010experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 \u03bcg and 200 LSD in a dose\u2010dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as \u201ccloseness\u201d \u201copenness\u201d, and \u201ctrust\u201d. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 \u03bcg than after 100 \u03bcg. Subjective effects after 200 \u03bcg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 \u03bcg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 \u03bcg than after 100 \u03bcg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose\u2010dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 \u03bcg and 200 \u03bcg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy."}

The aim of the present study was to characterize the pharmacokinetics and exposure-response relationship of oral LSD. METHODS: We analyzed pharmacokinetic data from two published placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of LSD 100 and 200\u00a0\u00b5g in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. The pharmacokinetics of the 100-\u00b5g dose is shown for the first time and data for the 200-\u00b5g dose were reanalyzed and included. Plasma concentrations of LSD, subjective effects, and vital signs were repeatedly assessed. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. RESULTS: Geometric mean (95% confidence interval) maximum plasma concentration values of 1.3 (1.2-1.9) and 3.1 (2.6-4.0) ng/mL were reached 1.4 and 1.5\u00a0h after administration of 100 and 200\u00a0\u00b5g LSD, respectively. The plasma half-life was 2.6\u00a0h (2.2-3.4\u00a0h). The subjective effects lasted (mean\u00a0\u00b1\u00a0standard deviation) 8.2\u00a0\u00b1\u00a02.1 and 11.6\u00a0\u00b1\u00a01.7\u00a0h for the 100- and 200-\u00b5g LSD doses, respectively. Subjective peak effects were reached 2.8 and 2.5\u00a0h after administration of LSD 100 and 200\u00a0\u00b5g, respectively. A close relationship was observed between the LSD concentration and subjective response within subjects, with moderate counterclockwise hysteresis. Half-maximal effective concentration values were in the range of 1\u00a0ng/mL. No correlations were found between plasma LSD concentrations and the effects of LSD across subjects at or near maximum plasma concentration and within dose groups. CONCLUSIONS: The present pharmacokinetic data are important for the evaluation of clinical study findings (e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging studies) and the interpretation of LSD intoxication. Oral LSD presented dose-proportional pharmacokinetics and first-order elimination up to 12\u00a0h. The effects of LSD were related to changes in plasma concentrations over time, with no evidence of acute tolerance. TRIAL REGISTRATION: NCT02308969, NCT01878942."}

The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-85913-001[/rid].) Rationale: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. Objectives: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. Methods: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. Results: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose\u2013response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 \u00b5g.

Increasing interest has also been seen in developing LSD into a medication. Therefore, we performed a pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic study using very low doses of LSD. Single doses of LSD base (5, 10, and 20\u00a0\u00b5g) and placebo were administered in a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover study in 23 healthy participants. Test days were separated by at least 5\u00a0days. Plasma levels of LSD and subjective effects were assessed up to 6\u00a0hours after administration. Pharmacokinetic parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal LSD concentrations were 151\u00a0pg/mL (127-181), 279\u00a0pg/mL (243-320), and 500\u00a0pg/mL (413-607) after 5, 10, and 20\u00a0\u00b5g LSD administration, respectively.

Plasma levels of LSD, nor-LSD, and 2-oxo-3-hydroxy-LSD (O-H-LSD) and subjective drug effects were assessed up to 11.5\u00a0hours. RESULTS: First-order elimination kinetics were observed for LSD. Geometric mean maximum concentration (C(max) ) values (range) of 1.7 (1.0-2.9) ng/mL were reached at a t(max) (range) of 1.7 (1.0-3.4) hours after drug administration. The plasma half-life (t(1/2) ) was 3.6 (2.4-7.3) hours. The AUC(\u221e) was 13 (7.1-28) ng\u00b7h/mL. No differences in these pharmacokinetic parameters were found between male and female subjects. Plasma O-H-LSD but not nor-LSD (< 0.01\u00a0ng/mL) concentrations could be quantified in all subjects. Geometric mean O-H-LSD C(max) values (range) of 0.11 (0.07-0.19) ng/mL were reached at a t(max) (range) of 5 (3.2-8) hours.

LSD has a long duration of acute action of 8-11 hours. It produces its acute psychedelic effects via stimulation of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (HT2A) receptor. Administration of the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin before LSD almost fully blocks the acute subjective response to LSD. However, unclear is whether ketanserin can also reverse the effects of LSD when administered after LSD. METHODS: We used a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design in 24 healthy participants who underwent two 14-hour sessions and received ketanserin (40 mg p.o.) or placebo 1 hour after LSD (100 \u00b5g p.o.). Outcome measures included subjective effects, autonomic effects, acute adverse effects, plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels, and pharmacokinetics up to 12 hours. RESULTS: Ketanserin reversed the acute response to LSD, thereby significantly reducing the duration of subjective effects from 8.5 hours with placebo to 3.5 hours. Ketanserin also reversed LSD-induced alterations of mind, including visual and acoustic alterations and ego dissolution. Ketanserin reduced adverse cardiovascular effects and mydriasis that were associated with LSD but had no effects on elevations of brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Ketanserin did not alter the pharmacokinetics of LSD. CONCLUSIONS: These findings are consistent with an interaction between ketanserin and LSD and the view that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when occupying 5-HT2A receptors. Ketanserin can effectively be used as a planned or rescue option to shorten and attenuate the LSD experience in humans in research and LSD-assisted therapy.

Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects. However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are lacking. METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of 100 and 200\u00a0\u03bcg LSD in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200\u00a0\u03bcg. RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200\u00a0\u03bcg LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 200\u00a0\u03bcg compared with 100\u00a0\u03bcg. Plasma levels of LSD were not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution at 100\u00a0\u03bcg. CONCLUSIONS: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater or different alterations of consciousness at 200\u00a0\u03bcg (i.e., a dose that is currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100\u00a0\u03bcg (i.e., a dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD, whereas more robustly induced effects of LSD may not result in such associations."}

This proof-of-concept study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and subjective effects of 50, 75, and 100\u2009\u00b5g lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy adults within a novel intervention paradigm. METHODS: Up to three participants were administered LSD on the same day in separate rooms, each with a single attendant, after 1\u2009day of preparation. An open-label design and a double-blind placebo-controlled design were used. RESULTS: Ninety-one percent of participants completed the study. Thirty-two adults (mean age\u2009=\u200928.8\u2009years) received 50 (n\u2009=\u20093), 75 (n\u2009=\u20097), 100 (n\u2009=\u20093) LSD, 50\u2009\u00b5g followed by 75\u2009\u00b5g LSD (n\u2009=\u20099) 1\u2009week apart, or placebo followed by a 75 \u00b5g LSD (n\u2009=\u200910) 1\u2009week apart.

The goal of this study was to characterize and compare the acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects and in patients with psychiatric disorders. Methods: We investigated the acute effects of 0.1 and 0.2 mg LSD in placebo\u2010controlled, double\u2010blind, cross\u2010over studies in 24 and 16 healthy subjects. Additionally, acute effects of LSD (0.1\u20100.2 mg) were assessed in 8 patients with various psychiatric diagnoses treated in Swiss psychiatric practices in group settings and in 11 patients with anxiety associated with life\u2010threatening illness and treated alone within a placebo\u2010controlled clinical trial. Acute subjective effects of LSD were assessed using visual analog scales (VASs), the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D\u2010ASC) scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ). Results: In healthy subjects, LSD acutely and dose\u2010dependently enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, trust and closeness to others on the VASs. On the 5D\u2010ASC, LSD increased ratings on all scales compared with placebo with higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 0.2 mg compared with 0.1 mg. LSD (0.1\u20100.2 mg) had similar effects on the 5D\u2010ASC and induced similar mystical\u2010type experiences in the MEQ in healthy subjects and patients (alone and in group settings). Conclusions: LSD has acute empathogenic effects that may be beneficial in psychotherapy. Preliminary findings indicate that LSD produced largely comparable acute alterations in consciousness and mystical\u2010type experiences in healthy subjects in an experimental setting and in psychiatric patients in different treatment settings."}

In these studies, LSD produced acute transient alterations in waking consciousness including visual perceptual alterations, audio\u2010visual synesthesia, derealization and depersonalization. Moreover, several of these studies described robust and sustained effects of LSD in patients suffering from addiction, anxiety and depression. Its psychedelic effects are mainly attributed to its potent partial 5\u2010HT2A receptor agonism. Consistently, administration the 5\u2010HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg) prior to the administration of LSD (100 \u03bcg) almost completely prevented the acute effects of LSD in another study of our research group (NCT03321136). The present study hypothesis is that ketanserin (40 mg) administered 1h after LSD shortens and reduces the acute subjective effects of LSD (100 \u03bcg) compared to LSD alone (100 \u03bcg) followed by placebo in healthy humans. Such a finding would confirm a primarily competitive antagonism of ketanserin and LSD at the 5\u2010HT2A receptor in vivo and indicate that LSD produces its psychedelic effects only when present at the receptor."}

Here, we investigated the effects of LSD on emotional empathy and mediating role of the serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine-2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor by administering 25, 50, 100, and 200\u00a0\u00b5g LSD alone and 200\u00a0\u00b5g LSD combined with pretreatment with the 5-HT(2A) receptor antagonist ketanserin (40\u00a0mg) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, random-order, crossover design in 16 healthy subjects. The Multifaceted Empathy Test (MET) was used to assess the effects of LSD on emotional empathy. Plasma oxytocin levels were also measured. LSD dose-dependently increased implicit and explicit emotional empathy, with the highest 200\u00a0\u00b5g LSD dose having a significant effect compared with placebo. The 200\u00a0\u00b5g dose of LSD also moderately increased plasma oxytocin levels compared with placebo. Ketanserin reduced the LSD-induced elevations of oxytocin but not the LSD-induced increases in emotional empathy. These findings confirm that LSD enhances empathy, and this effect may be partially independent of its primary action on 5-HT(2A) receptors to induce subjective psychedelic effects. In contrast, LSD-induced oxytocin release may depend on 5-HT(2A) receptor stimulation, which is consistent with the psychedelic effect of LSD. Further studies are needed to investigate whether LSD may also enhance empathy and potentially produce therapeutic effects in patients who have deficits in empathy and impairments in social functioning."}

LSD produces pronounced acute psychedelic effects, although its influence on plasma steroid levels over time has not yet been characterised in humans. The effects of LSD (200 \u03bcg) or placebo on plasma steroid levels were investigated in 16 healthy subjects using a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study design. Plasma concentration-time profiles were determined for 15 steroids using liquid-chromatography tandem mass-spectrometry. LSD increased plasma concentrations of the glucocorticoids cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone and 11-dehydrocorticosterone compared to placebo. The mean maximum concentration of LSD was reached at 1.7 h. Mean peak psychedelic effects were reached at 2.4 h, with significant alterations in mental state from 0.5 h to > 10 h. Mean maximal concentrations of cortisol and corticosterone were reached at 2.5 h and 1.9 h, and significant elevations were observed 1.5-6 h and 1-3 h after drug administration, respectively. LSD also significantly increased plasma concentrations of the androgen dehydroepiandrosterone but not other androgens, progestogens or mineralocorticoids compared to placebo. A close relationship was found between plasma LSD concentrations and changes in plasma cortisol and corticosterone and the psychotropic response to LSD, and no clockwise hysteresis was observed. In conclusion, LSD produces significant acute effects on circulating steroids, especially glucocorticoids. LSD-induced changes in circulating glucocorticoids were associated with plasma LSD concentrations over time and showed no acute pharmacological tolerance."}

In this meta-analysis, we explored the effects of LSD on healthy subjects with respect to subjective drug effects, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of LSD in healthy people. Subsequently, 5 RCTs with 132 healthy people which focused on the effects of LSD were enrolled in our study. RESULT: We found that taking 50, 100 and 200\u00a0mcg LSD doses were associated with a significant increase in the maximal difference from the baseline compared to the placebo group among the outcomes of AMRS (Adjective Mood Rating Scale) score. Significant differences existed between the LSD and placebo groups when taking 100 and 200\u00a0mcg LSD in acute adverse effects (100\u00a0mcg: SMD\u00a0=\u00a0.97, 95% confidence interval [CI], .50, 1.44, Z\u00a0=\u00a04.04, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001; 200\u00a0mcg: SMD\u00a0=\u00a01.18, 95% CI, 0.65, 1.72, Z\u00a0=\u00a04.32, p\u00a0<\u00a0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the subjective effects of LSD in healthy people revealed moderate significant effect sizes in favor of LSD with no significant adverse effects. A 100\u00a0mcg dose of LSD has potential for use in psychological-assisted therapy and may improve the mental fitness of patients with disease-related psychiatric distress. Additional clinical trials are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of LSD as a psychological-assisted therapy."}

Additionally, there is still very limited data to what extent the 5HT2A receptor contributes to LSD's effects and its role in the mediation of the full response to LSD at a high dose is unclear. A recent experimental human study showed the 5\u2010HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin fully blocked the subjective effects of a moderate dose of 100 \u00b5g of LSD [6]. But, whether the effects of a high 200 \u00b5g oral dose of LSD can be blocked by the selective pharmacological 5\u2010HT2A antagonist ketanserin remains to be tested to confirm the critical role of the 5\u2010HT2A receptor in more pronounced alterations of consciousness and perception. The present study therefore explores the role the 5\u2010HT2A receptor in LSD\u2010induced altered states of consciousness using escalating doses of LSD and the 5\u2010HT2A receptor blocker ketanserin administered before a high dose of LSD."}

However, few placebo-controlled studies have examined the acute effects of low doses of LSD in individuals with psychiatric symptoms. In the current study, we examined the acute and sub-acute effect of a low dose of LSD (26\u2009\u00b5g) on subjective effects and mood in volunteers with mild depressed mood. The study used a randomized, double-blind, crossover design to compare the effects of LSD in two groups of adults: participants who scored high (\u226517; n\u2009=\u200920) or low (<17; n\u2009=\u200919) on the Beck Depression-II inventory (BDI) at screening. Participants received a single low dose of LSD (26\u2009\u00b5g) and placebo during two 5-h laboratory sessions, separated by at least one week. Subjective, physiological, and mood measures were assessed at regular intervals throughout the sessions, and behavioral measures of creativity and emotion recognition were obtained at expected peak effect. BDI depression scores and mood ratings were assessed 48-h after each session. Relative to placebo, LSD (26\u2009\u00b5g) produced expected, mild physiological and subjective effects on several measures in both groups. However, the high BDI group reported significantly greater drug effects on several indices of acute effects, including ratings of vigor, elation, and affectively positive scales of a measure of psychedelic effects (5D-ASC). The high BDI group also reported a greater decline in BDI depression scores 48-h after LSD, compared to placebo. These findings suggest that an acute low dose of LSD (26\u2009\u00b5g) elicits more pronounced positive mood and stimulant-like effects, as well as stronger altered states of consciousness in individuals with depressive symptoms, compared to non-depressed individuals."}

These effects are consistent both with the known actions of LSD on serotonin receptors and with limited evidence that higher doses of LSD (100-200 \u03bcg) positively bias emotion processing. Yet, the effects of such subthreshold doses of LSD have not been tested in a controlled laboratory setting. As a first step, we examined the effects of single very low doses of LSD (0-26 \u03bcg) on mood and behavior in healthy volunteers under double-blind conditions. METHODS: Healthy young adults (N\u00a0= 20) attended 4 laboratory sessions during which they received 0 (placebo), 6.5, 13, or 26 \u03bcg of LSD in randomized order at 1-week intervals. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing and cognition. Cardiovascular measures and body temperature were also assessed. RESULTS: LSD produced dose-related subjective effects across the 3 doses (6.5, 13, and 26 \u03bcg). At the highest dose, the drug also increased ratings of vigor and slightly decreased positivity ratings of images with positive emotional content. Other mood measures, cognition, and physiological measures were unaffected. CONCLUSIONS: Single microdoses of LSD produced orderly dose-related subjective effects in healthy volunteers. These findings indicate that a threshold dose of 13 \u03bcg of LSD might be used safely in an investigation of repeated administrations. It remains to be determined whether the drug improves mood or cognition in individuals with symptoms of depression."}

There were five recent studies in healthy participants and one in patients. In a controlled setting, LSD acutely induced bliss, audiovisual synesthesia, altered meaning of perceptions, derealization, depersonalization, and mystical experiences. These subjective effects of LSD were mediated by the 5-HT(2A) receptor. LSD increased feelings of closeness to others, openness, trust, and suggestibility. LSD impaired the recognition of sad and fearful faces, reduced left amygdala reactivity to fearful faces, and enhanced emotional empathy. LSD increased the emotional response to music and the meaning of music. LSD acutely produced deficits in sensorimotor gating, similar to observations in schizophrenia. LSD had weak autonomic stimulant effects and elevated plasma cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin levels. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance studies showed that LSD acutely reduced the integrity of functional brain networks and increased connectivity between networks that normally are more dissociated. LSD increased functional thalamocortical connectivity and functional connectivity of the primary visual cortex with other brain areas. The latter effect was correlated with subjective hallucinations. LSD acutely induced global increases in brain entropy that were associated with greater trait openness 14 days later. In patients with anxiety associated with life-threatening disease, anxiety was reduced for 2 months after two doses of LSD. In medical settings, no complications of LSD administration were observed. These data should contribute to further investigations of the therapeutic potential of LSD in psychiatry."}

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of LSD, iso-LSD, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD (O-H-LSD), and nor-LSD in plasma samples from 24\u00a0healthy subjects after controlled administration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg LSD in a clinical trial. In addition, metabolites that have been recently described in in vitro studies, including lysergic acid monoethylamide (LAE), lysergic acid ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamide (LEO), 2-oxo-LSD, trioxylated-LSD, and 13/14-hydroxy-LSD, should be identified. METHODS: Separation of LSD and its metabolites was achieved on a reversed phase chromatography column after turbulent-flow online extraction. For the identification and quantification, a triple-stage quadrupole LC-MS/MS instrument was used. RESULTS: The validation data showed slight matrix effects for LSD, iso-LSD, O-H-LSD, or nor-LSD. Mean intraday and interday accuracy and precision were 105%/4.81% and 105%/4.35% for LSD, 98.7%/5.75% and 99.4%/7.21% for iso-LSD, 106%/4.54% and 99.4%/7.21% for O-H-LSD, and 107%/5.82% and 102%/5.88% for nor-LSD, respectively.

CONCLUSION: The method described herein was accurate, precise, and the calibration range within the range of expected plasma concentrations. LSD was quantified in the plasma samples of the 24 subjects of the clinical trial, whereas iso-LSD, O-H-LSD, nor-LSD, LAE, LEO, 13/14-hydroxy-LSD, and 2-oxo-LSD could only sporadically be detected but were too low for quantification."}

Methods: The present study characterized the pharmacokinetics, pharmacokinetic\u2013pharmacodynamic relationship and urinary recovery of LSD at doses of 85 and 170 \u03bcg administered orally in 28 healthy participants. The plasma concentrations and subjective effects of LSD were continuously evaluated over a period of 24 h.

METHODS: We investigated the lasting effects of a single dose of LSD (200\u00a0\u03bcg) that was administered in a laboratory setting in 16 healthy participants. The following outcome measures were assessed before and 1 and 12\u00a0months after LSD administration: Persisting Effects Questionnaire (PEQ), Mysticism Scale (MS), Death Transcendence Scale (DTS), NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI), and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). RESULTS: On the PEQ, positive attitudes about life and/or self, positive mood changes, altruistic/positive social effects, positive behavioral changes, and well-being/life satisfaction significantly increased at 1 and 12\u00a0months and were subjectively attributed by the subjects to the LSD experience. Five-Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) total scores, reflecting acutely induced alterations in consciousness, and Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) total scores correlated with changes in well-being/life satisfaction 12\u00a0months after LSD administration. No changes in negative attitudes, negative mood, antisocial/negative social effects, or negative behavior were attributed to the LSD experience. After 12\u00a0months, 10 of 14 participants rated their LSD experience as among the top 10 most meaningful experiences in their lives. Five participants rated the LSD experience among the five most spiritually meaningful experiences in their lives. On the MS and DTS, ratings of mystical experiences significantly increased 1 and 12\u00a0months after LSD administration compared with the pre-LSD screening. No relevant changes in personality measures were found. CONCLUSIONS: In healthy research subjects, the administration of a single dose of LSD (200\u00a0\u03bcg) in a safe setting was subjectively considered a personally meaningful experience that had long-lasting subjective positive effects.

Pharmacological Treatment is limited and relapse is frequent. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in humans in the 1950s and 1960s and was shown to attenuate depressive symptoms. Clinical research with LSD ended in the 1970s due to regulatory restrictions but its use for personal and recreational purposes continued. In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in the use of hallucinogens in psychiatric research and practices, reconsidering LSD's antidepressant potential. Larger, well\u2010designed and placebo\u2010controlled studies are warranted. This study will evaluate the potential benefits of LSD\u2010assisted psychotherapy in patients suffering from Major Depressive Disorder. Objective: To test the efficacy of LSD in patients with Major Depressive Disorder.

METHODS: This study aimed to describe patient characteristics, treatment indications and acute alterations of mind in patients receiving LSD (100-200\u2009\u00b5g) and/or MDMA (100-175\u2009mg) within the Swiss compassionate use programme from 2014-2018. Acute effects were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire, and compared with those in healthy volunteers administered with LSD or MDMA and patients treated alone with LSD in clinical trials. RESULTS: Eighteen patients (including 12 women and six men, aged 29-77\u2009years) were treated in group settings. Indications mostly included posttraumatic stress disorder and major depression. Generally, a drug-assisted session was conducted every 3.5\u2009months after 3-10 psychotherapy sessions. LSD induced pronounced alterations of consciousness on the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale, and mystical-type experiences with increases in all scales on the Mystical Experience Questionnaire.

A valid, direct comparison of the effects of these substances is lacking. The main goal of the present study was to investigate potential pharmacological, physiological and phenomenological differences at psychoactive-equivalent doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The present study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over design to compare the acute subjective effects, autonomic effects, and pharmacokinetics of typically used, moderate to high doses of mescaline (300 and 500\u2009mg), LSD (100\u2009\u00b5g), and psilocybin (20\u2009mg) in 32 healthy participants. A mescaline dose of 300\u2009mg was used in the first 16 participants and 500\u2009mg was used in the subsequent 16 participants. Acute subjective effects of 500\u2009mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were comparable across various psychometric scales. Autonomic effects of 500\u2009mg mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin were moderate, with psilocybin causing a higher increase in diastolic blood pressure compared with LSD, and LSD showing a trend toward an increase in heart rate compared with psilocybin. The tolerability of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin was comparable, with mescaline at both doses inducing slightly more subacute adverse effects (12-24\u2009h) than LSD and psilocybin. Clear distinctions were seen in the duration of action between the three substances. Mescaline had the longest effect duration (mean: 11.1\u2009h), followed by LSD (mean: 8.2\u2009h), and psilocybin (mean: 4.9\u2009h). Plasma elimination half-lives of mescaline and LSD were similar (approximately 3.5\u2009h). The longer effect duration of mescaline compared with LSD was due to the longer time to reach maximal plasma concentrations and related peak effects. Mescaline and LSD, but not psilocybin, enhanced circulating oxytocin. None of the substances altered plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations. In conclusion, the present study found no evidence of qualitative differences in altered states of consciousness that were induced by equally strong doses of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin. The results indicate that any differences in the pharmacological profiles of mescaline, LSD, and psilocybin do not translate into relevant differences in the subjective experience.

There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3\u20104\u2010 day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double\u2010blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 \u03bcg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 \u03bcg LSD (N = 19), or 26 \u03bcg LSD(N = 19) during four 5\u2010hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3\u20104 days.

Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing improves cognitive functioning and mood. However, few controlled studies have examined the effects of exposure to repeated microdoses in humans. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of repeated low doses of LSD on mood, cognition, and subjective experiences in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study, healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 received four sublingual doses of placebo (n = 18), 13 \u03bcg (n = 19), or 26 \u03bcg (n = 19) of LSD administered every 3 to 4 days. Physiological, subjective, mood, and cognitive outcome measures were collected over five in\u2010laboratory sessions. Acute effects were examined during the first and fourth drug administration sessions, and lasting effects of LSD were examined during the fifth drug\u2010free session. RESULTS: Over the four drug administration sessions, repeated microdoses of LSD elicited dose\u2010dependent subjective \u201cdrug feel\u201d effects (26 \u03bcg vs. placebo; 26 \u03bcg vs. 13 \u03bcg, P < 0.05) and stimulant\u2010like effects (26 \u03bcg vs. placebo; 26 \u03bcg vs. 13 \u03bcg, P < 0.05). LSD also acutely decreased negative mood during a simulated social rejection task (26 \u03bcg vs placebo, P < 0.05). Overall, the drug produced minimal effects on physiological, cognitive, and most other mood\u2010related measures. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to low doses of LSD have minimal effects on overall mood and cognitive performance in healthy adults. Future studies with symptomatic volunteers or different doses may be needed to investigate the claims of microdose users."}

Additionally LSD is currently reused in experimental studies with healthy subjects and in studies investigating its effects on patients suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction personality disorders, cluster headache, migraine, and other pathological conditions. When LSD is used recreationally, it is administered mostly in the form of LSD tartrate on filter paper (blotter) or as a liquid. In experimental research over the past years, LSD has mostly been used in the form of LSD base, which is lipophilic and therefore has typically been administered as a solution in ethanol. However, some researchers have also use LSD tartrate orally or LSD base intravenously. Currently, it is not clear how these different forms of LSD compare regarding their bioequivalence and effects. The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (100 \u03bcg LSD in 96% ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (100 \u03bcg LSD), (3) LSD tartrate used in research and recreationally (100 \u03bcg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (100 \u03bcg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple\u2010dummy). The primary goals are to document the bioequivalence of LSD base (1) and tartrate (3) and to define the oral bioavailability of LSD using an additional intravenous LSD administration."}

As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5\u03bcg, 13\u03bcg, or 26\u03bcg LSD in randomized order.

Clinical studies in the 1960s and 1970s have demonstrated profound analgesic effects of full doses of LSD in terminally ill patients, but this line of research evaporated after LSD was scheduled worldwide. AIM: The present clinical study is the first to revisit the potential of LSD as an analgesic, and at dose levels which are not expected to produce profound mind-altering effects. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers received single doses of 5, 10 and 20\u2009\u00b5g LSD as well as placebo on separate occasions. A Cold Pressor Test was administered at 1.5 and 5\u2009h after treatment administration to assess pain tolerance to experimentally evoked pain. Ratings of dissociation and psychiatric symptoms as well as assessments of vital signs were included to monitor mental status as well as safety during treatments. RESULTS: LSD 20\u2009\u00b5g significantly increased the time that participants were able to tolerate exposure to cold (3\u00b0C) water and decreased their subjective levels of experienced pain and unpleasantness. LSD elevated mean blood pressure within the normal range and slightly increased ratings of dissociation, anxiety and somatization. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence of a protracted analgesic effect of LSD at a dose that is low enough to avoid a psychedelic experience. The present data warrant further research into the analgesic effects of low doses of LSD in patient populations."}

Yet, the behavioral, neural, and subjective effects of low doses of LSD have only recently been tested in a controlled laboratory setting, and little is known about inter\u2010individual variability in the drug's effects. We have examined the effects of single low doses of LSD on mood and behavior in healthy volunteers under double\u2010blind conditions. Here we report on individual differences in responses to a single low dose LSD (13\u03bcg) in relation to personality traits. Methods: As part of two studies, healthy young men and women (N = 35) attended laboratory sessions during which they received placebo or 13\u03bcg LSD in separate sessions at one\u2010week intervals, under double blind conditions in mixed order. Subjects completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing and cognition during the sessions. They completed the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire at the end of each session, and the Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) at intake. Results: LSD produced modest subjective effects, including increases on ratings of \"feel drug\" and \"feel high\" and on the \"Blissful State\" domain of the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. These subjective effects were most pronounced in individuals who scored high on Negative Emotionality on the MPQ (r = 0.37 p = 0.03; r = 0.37 p = 0.03; r = 0.45 p = 0.01). Conclusions: A threshold \"microdose\" of LSD (13\u03bcg) produced modest subjective effects in healthy volunteers and these effects were strongest among individuals with high negative emotionality scores. These findings are consistent with the idea that the drug improves mood in individuals with symptoms of depression."}

In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5\u00a0\u03bcg, 10\u00a0\u03bcg, 20\u00a0\u03bcg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4\u00a0days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age\u2009=\u200962.9\u00a0years) received placebo (n\u2009=\u200912), 5\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u2009=\u200912), 10\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u2009=\u200912), or 20\u00a0\u03bcg (n\u2009=\u200912) LSD.

Targeted immunotherapies capable of significantly reducing A\u03b2 and tau burden have failed to modify AD progression in late\u2010stage clinical trials, and the only FDA\u2010approved drug therapies are palliative in nature with marginal clinical efficacy, highlighting the urgent need to evaluate new approaches to disease modification. Multi\u2010targeted drugs (MTDs) with established safety profiles could empirically engage identified therapeutic targets. In this presentation, we propose the hypothesis that microdoses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) represent a promising disease modifying therapeutic for AD and we present findings from a phase 1, double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled, randomized study of repeat dosing of microdoses of LSD. LSD is a classic psychedelic drug, described as ?promiscuous? due to its remarkable polypharmacology: it binds with moderate\u2010to\u2010high affinity to several aminergic receptor subtypes. LSD is one of the most well\u2010studied psychoactive drugs in the history of modern pharmacology, and has been evaluated extensively both preclinically and clinically following the serendipitous discovery of its psychoactive properties in 1943. LSD is a mixed agonist or antagonist at a subset of serotonin (5\u2010HT), dopamine and other aminergic receptors, and shares structural similarity to 5\u2010HT. Objective: We present findings from a study that evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally administered repeat dosing of microdoses of LSD. Methods: Healthy male and female volunteers aged 55 to 75 years were screened within 28 days of randomization. Volunteers were assessed for eligibility based on medical history, physical examination, and inclusion and exclusion criteria. Eligible volunteers were randomised to one of four dose groups (5 \u03bcg, 10 \u03bcg, or 20 \u03bcg LSD or placebo). Volunteers received their assigned study dose in an in\u2010patient setting on 6 separate occasions; each dose was separated by exactly 3 days for 21 days. Safety and tolerability evaluations consisted of adverse event (AE) monitoring, administration of the C\u2010SSRS, blood pressure, and pulse rate at every visit from screening through to follow\u2010up. Clinical laboratory evaluations (i.e. hematology, blood chemistry, urinalysis) at screening, baseline, dose 3, dose 6, and follow\u2010up. Electrocardiogram (ECG) parameters and physical examinations were assessed at screening and follow\u2010up. The raw PK data (i.e. actual drug concentrations over time profiles) were collected following the first and sixth doses. The PK parameters were derived from the individual subject profiles separately using non\u2010compartmental methods. The magnitude of the effect of LSD was explored across specific PD measures, which included the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB), proprioception, and balance. Subjective drug effects were assessed during dose day at multiple time points via visual analogue scale (VAS) and a single administration of the Five Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness (5D\u2010ASC) questionnaire. Results: A total of forty\u2010eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 yrs) were enrolled in the trial and received placebo (n=12), 5 \u03bcg (n=12), 10 \u03bcg (n=12), or 20 \u03bcg (n=12) LSD on 6 study days. The only minor, though statistically insignificant, difference between placebo and active treatment groups was in the number of headaches reported and these were either mild or moderate in intensity. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Other safety assessments performed, including laboratory safety assessments, vital signs, and ECGs support the conclusion that low dose LSD did not present a safety concern. Pharmacokinetic parameters showed that LSD plasma levels were undetectable or the 5 \u03bcg group and that peak blood plasma levels for the 10 \u03bcg and 20 \u03bcg groups occurred at approximately 30 minutes and had a terminal half\u2010life of 8.25 hours (+/\u20101.6 SE). Assessments balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment, as well as no cognitive impairment or enhancement. While there was no dose\u2010response relationship with cognitive, balance, or proprioceptive tasks, regression analysis on the average maximum rating of the subjective effects questionnaire and the 5D\u2010ASC showed a positive linear relationship between dose and 'vigilance reduction. Three questions from the subjective drug effects VAS including 'feeling bad drug effects,' also exhibited a statistically significant linear relationship with LSD dose. Conclusion: In summary, this phase 1 study of intermittent microdoses up to 20\u03bcg LSD in a healthy older population yielded reassuring data regarding the safety and tolerability. These findings support the feasibility of this approach for larger studies designed to evaluate possible anxiolytic, anti\u2010depressant, and anti\u2010inflammatory properties of low dose LSD, including specific evaluation as a disease modifying therapy in Alzheimer's Disease."}

Whereas most studies utilize relatively high doses, there are also reports of beneficial effects of \"microdosing,\" or repeated use of very low doses of these drugs. The behavioral and neural effects of these low doses are not fully understood. OBJECTIVES: To examine the effects of LSD (13 \u03bcg and 26 \u03bcg) versus placebo on resting-state electroencephalography (EEG) and event-related potential (ERP) responses in healthy adults. METHODS: Twenty-two healthy men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 3 EEG sessions in which they received placebo or LSD (13 \u03bcg and 26 \u03bcg) under double-blind conditions. During each session, participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires at hourly intervals, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, EEG recordings were obtained, including resting-state neural oscillations in scalp electrodes over default mode network (DMN) regions and P300, N170, and P100 ERPs evoked during a visual oddball paradigm. RESULTS: LSD dose-dependently reduced oscillatory power across delta, theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequency bands during both eyes closed and eyes open resting conditions. During the oddball task, LSD dose-dependently reduced ERP amplitudes for P300 and N170 components and increased P100 latency. LSD also produced dose-related increases in positive mood, elation, energy, and anxiety and increased heart rate and blood pressure. On a measure of altered states of consciousness, LSD dose-dependently increased Blissful State, but not other indices of perceptual or sensory effects typical of psychedelic drugs. The subjective effects of the drug were not correlated with the EEG measures. CONCLUSIONS: Low doses of LSD produced broadband cortical desynchronization over the DMN during resting state and reduced P300 and N170 amplitudes, patterns similar to those reported with higher doses of psychedelics. Notably, these neurophysiological effects raise the possibility that very low doses of LSD may produce subtle behavioral and perhaps therapeutic effects that do not rely on the full psychedelic experience."}
