Despite the importance of altered bodily self\u2010perception in disorders such as anorexia nervosa or depression, the neural mechanisms underlying these changes are poorly understood. Methods: Fifteen healthy humans participated in a randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, within\u2010subject study. Participants received Placebo or Psilocybin (0.2 mg/kg body weight). A Roving Somatosensory Oddball Task was conducted while participants underwent simultaneous EEG/fMRI scanning. FMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model. Global field power and event\u2010related potentials were analyzed. Results: Psilocybin reduced the BOLD signal in the Deviant > Standard contrast in the prefrontal cortex (p<0.05, FWE corrected). A significant interaction between treatment condition and stimulus type was revealed for the frontal electrode AF2 (F(1, 14) = 5.129, p < 0.05) with a significant difference between Standard and Deviant in the Placebo condition, but not in the Psilocybin condition. A significant positive correlation was found between Psilocybin\u2010induced \u201cDisembodiment\u201d and the mean amplitude of the EEG difference wave in the Psilocybin condition (r = 0.630, p = 0.012). Conclusions: These results show that a disruption of tactile prediction error processing in the medial prefrontal cortex may underlie changes in bodily self\u2010perception. This seems to be driven by increased salience attribution to non\u2010salient stimuli under psilocybin. Together these results shed light on the mechanistic underpinnings of altered bodily self\u2010perception and may therefore highlight important therapeutic targets for psychiatric disorders characterized by altered bodily self\u2010perception body perception such as anorexia nervosa and depression.

Following our protocol (CRD 42022220190) multiple electronic databases were searched from their inception until February 2023, to identify double-blind randomized placebo-controlled (RCTs) fixed-dose trials evaluating the use of psilocybin for adult patients with primary or secondary depression.

Eight months before her first appointment with one of the authors, the patient was in her usual state of health. She had a history of mild depression and generalized anxiety disorder, successfully treated with venlafaxine prescribed by her psychiatrist. At this time, her sleep, appetite, concentration, and range of mood were normal. She was employed as a senior associate at a high-level accounting firm and had graduated from a prestigious graduate school, both competitive environments in which she excelled. In the fall of 2020, at the urging of friends, the patient decided to ingest psilocybin mushrooms. She was still consistently taking venlafaxine at the time of ingestion. Hours after the second ingestion, she developed paranoid delusions, which persisted for months. After 2 months, during which she titrated up to the relatively high dosage of 4.5 mg/day of pramipexole, she reported a significant shift in her functioning. She started to feel emotions again, and began to performbasic errands and self-care. Using the experience of the patient presented in this case\u2014a patient who experienced a profound negative reaction after recreational ingestion of psilocybin mushrooms\u2014to understand some of the risks associated with psychedelic use, authors discuss several challenging issues that are emerging as psychedelics receive more media attention and become more available. Authors explore differences between clinical and nonclinical psychedelic use and their attendant risks and benefits. This case suggests that current policy trends, including efforts to render psychedelics widely available for therapeutic use, will place patients at undue risk. Finally, authors make recommendations for the future of psychedelic research and clinical applications based on the patient\u2019s experience. Details of the case have been modified to protect the patient\u2019s identity, and the patient has approved publication of the case for educational purposes. Psychiatrists have an ethical obligation to maintain clinical equipoise with regard to new treatments while they are still in the investigational stage. At this point, psychedelics are on track to becoming an evidence-based psychiatric intervention, with positive clinical trials thus far. Optimism about these positive results is warranted, but psychiatrists should be aware that only a few hundred patients have actually received psilocybin in clinical research settings\u2014which suggests a field that is still in its infancy\u2014and, in contrast to other randomized placebo-controlled clinical trials, blinding is simply not possible with psilocybin. Psychiatrists should remain open to any outcome of clinical research while the safety and efficacy of psychedelics are still being determined. Right now, a promising psychiatric treatment risks getting swept up in a broader cultural moment\u2014a dynamic that could lead to compromises in quality and reduce the efficacy of psychedelic therapies. Similar cultural forces led to the demise of psychedelic therapies a half century ago. Today we find ourselves in the unprecedented position where the safety and efficacy of medical treatments are being decided by popular opinion\u2014and at the expense of the scientific process. The field of psychiatry should stand for the integrity of the scientific process, and encourage the development and administration of new treatments, including psychedelic therapies, in ways that maximize their safety and efficacy.

Music is known as a key element of psychedelic-assisted therapy due to its psychological effects, specifically on the emotion, meaning-making, and sensory processing. However, there is still a lack of understanding in how psychedelics influence brain activity in experimental settings involving music listening. OBJECTIVES: The main goal of our research was to investigate the effect of music, as a part of \"setting,\" on the brain states dynamics after lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) intake. METHODS: We used an open dataset, where a group of 15 participants underwent two functional MRI scanning sessions under LSD and placebo influence. Every scanning session contained three runs: two resting-state runs separated by one run with music listening. We applied K-Means clustering to identify the repetitive patterns of brain activity, so-called brain states. For further analysis, we calculated states' dwell time, fractional occupancy and transition probability. RESULTS: The interaction effect of music and psychedelics led to change in the time-varying brain activity of the task-positive state. LSD, regardless of the music, affected the dynamics of the state of combined activity of DMN, SOM, and VIS networks. Crucially, we observed that the music itself could potentially have a long-term influence on the resting-state, in particular on states involving task-positive networks. CONCLUSIONS: This study indicates that music, as a crucial element of \"setting,\" can potentially have an influence on the subject's resting-state during psychedelic experience.

Methods: Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire.

Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Results: Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms.

A microdose is by definition sub\u2010perceptual, suggested to be one tenth of a \u2018regular dose\u2019 and used according to a repeated dosing schedule to enhance mood and/or cognitive performance [3]. However, users indicate that they do not know the exact dose they actually consume to experience aforementioned effects [2]. Aim: The primary objective was to determine the effective dose which changes mood and cognition. Methods: A placebo\u2010controlled, randomized within\u2010subjects study including 24 healthy recreational drug users (12 males, 12 females) was set up to test the acute effects of three different LSD microdoses (5, 10, and 20 mcg, p.o.) compared to placebo on measures of cognition, mood, and subjective experience up to 6 hours after administration. Cognitive performance was assessed at 2 and 4 hours post\u2010drug and included measures of attention (Psychomotor Vigilance Task (PVT)) and set\u2010shifting (Digit Symbol Substitution Task (DSST)). Mood changes were measured five times per test day (Profile of Mood States (POMS)); subjective drug effects (Visual Analogue Scales (VAS)) were measured ten times, and psychedelic experience was measured at the end of each test day (5\u2010Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D\u2010ASC)). Statistics: Data was analysed by means of a General Linear Model Univariate Analysis of Variance with Drug (4 levels) and Time as fixed factors, and Participant (PPNR) as a random factor. The model was customized to examine 3 main effects (Drug, Time and PPNR), and two interaction effects of Drug x Time, and Drug x PPNR. For the 5D\u2010ASC, no Time effect was included. Results: The highest dose (20 mcg) significantly improved attention in the PVT (Number of Lapses: p< 0.01; Reaction Time: p= 0.03) and increased self\u2010rated mood in the POMS (positive mood, p< 0.01) and VAS (happiness, p< 0.01) while impairing performance in shifting task (DSST, p< 0.01) and decreasing self\u2010rated levels on the VAS of concentration (p< 0.01) and productivity (p< 0.01) compared to placebo. The intermediate dose (10 mcg) increased the feeling of productivity (p= 0.03). Participants noticed they were under the influence of LSD after the high and intermediate dose (p< 0.01) and an increase in psychedelic state was experienced (p< 0.01). Furthermore, results showed a significant interaction of Drug x PPNR on the PVT, DSST, POMS, and VAS, indicating individual differences in response to the different doses. Conclusion: While findings show that a single LSD dose (20 mcg) acutely enhances subjective (mood) effects and attention, more complex cognitive performance is impaired and perceptual \u2018hallucinogenic\u2019 effects are experienced, though the latter are negligible when compared to full LSD doses. Future studies need to establish whether these effects on cognition and mood persist beyond the acute stage and whether they change after repeated administration. In addition, future studies should investigate what distinguishes one person from another in their response to a microdose of LSD.

PTSD is a worldwide health problem. Psychotherapy or drugs are used to treat PTSD, but there is an interest in developing other treatment options. 3,4\u2010methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)\u2010assisted psychotherapy is one potential treatment. MDMA is known as the active ingredient in \"ecstasy.\" It was used along with psychotherapy to treat people in the past, and a study suggests that MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy might help people with PTSD. This Phase 2 research study will investigate the safety and efficacy of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy in 10 people with chronic, treatment\u2010resistant posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). After open\u2010label lead\u2010in in two subjects there will be a randomized, double\u2010blind arm comparing 125 vs. 25 mg MDMA in eight participants, and an open\u2010label arm for participants who received active placebo. In this study, five people will be randomly assigned to receive the full dose of 125 and 62.5 mg MDMA and three will be randomized to receive the active placebo dose of 25 and 125. mg MDMA. MDMA will be administered during two six to eight hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination and a measure of their PTSD symptoms to make sure they meet the criteria to be in the study. Subjects must be in good physical health. They will also complete questionnaires about their PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality. These tests will be given by a researcher who will not be present during any of the therapy sessions. This same researcher will give the subject the same tests or measures two months after the second experimental session and 12 months after a final experimental session. Once enrolled, subjects will have three preparatory sessions with a team of two therapists, one male and one female. The same team of therapists will work with them throughout the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy and the therapists will learn more about the subject's goals, hopes and fears. Starting from the second preparatory session, subjects will answer questions on thoughts about hurting or killing themselves; these questions will be asked during face to face contact this and on two of the contact days, which may occur over the telephone. Subjects will have to stop taking their psychiatric medication before they have their first experimental session, with exact times dependent upon the specific medications involved. Subjects and the therapists, but not the person measuring symptoms, will find out if the subject had the active placebo or full dose of MDMA at this time, and if the subject had the active placebo, they can start the second arm of the study. What happens during this arm is very similar to the arm except that the subject and therapists will know the subject is getting a full dose of MDMA. Twelve months after the subject's final follow\u2010up visit (two months after their final experimental session), PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression and sleep quality will be assessed again, and subjects will complete an additional questionnaire about their experiences during and after the study. The study will compare PTSD symptoms before and after MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy with a full dose and therapy with an active placebo dose of MDMA. Both therapists will be present for each experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will be encouraged to confront trauma\u2010related thoughts, feelings and memories. Blood pressure, heart rate (pulse) and body temperature will be measured regularly, and the researchers will periodically ask the subject to rate his or her degree of distress. Subjects will stay overnight at the clinic and have their first integrative session, where they will examine what happened during their experimental session. They will have two more integrative ses ions until they have their next experimental session. Subjects will fill out a questionnaire on their PTSD symptoms on every third integrative session.

Using functional imaging and a face-learning task, we investigated neural correlates of encoding and recalling face-name associations in 20 recreational drug users whose predominant drug use was ecstasy and 20 controls.

In both ecstasy and cannabis groups brain activation was decreased in the right medial frontal gyrus, left parahippocampal gyrus, left dorsal cingulate gyrus, and left caudate.

Oral racemic ketamine may be an important approach to the emergency management of suicide risk in clinical settings, especially in third world countries, that have a limited range of available healthcare resources. METHODS: In a prospective, uncontrolled, open-label investigation, we studied 30 severely depressed inpatients who consented to participate in a pilot hospital service offering ketamine for management of high suicide risk. Patients sipped a solution of racemic ketamine (150\u00a0mg) across 10-15\u00a0min in 3 alternate day sessions. Patients were assessed using the Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and Clinical Global Improvement-Severity (CGI-S) scale at baseline and 1\u00a0day after the last ketamine session. RESULTS: There was statistically and clinically significant improvement on all outcomes. Mean (standard deviation) MSSI scores dropped from 25.1(1.8) to 17.3(5.6), MADRS scores from 28.8(3.4) to 21.9(3.6), and CGI-S scores from 6.0(0.2) to 3.6(0.9).

Ketamine as an anesthesia and analgesia drug has been used for a long time. In recent years, ketamine is proved to have an antidepression effect with a single administration. We hypothesized that intraoperative ketamine can reduce postpartum depressive symptoms after cesarean delivery. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study trail, healthy women scheduled for cesarean delivery were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (0.25\u00a0mg/kg diluted to 5\u00a0ml with 0.9% saline) or placebo (5\u00a0ml of 0.9% saline) within 5\u00a0min following clamping of the neonatal umbilical cord. The primary outcome was the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms, which was evaluated by Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS, a threshold of 9/10 was used) at 1\u00a0week, 2\u00a0weeks, and 1\u00a0month after delivery. The secondary outcome was the numerical rating scale (NRS) score of pain at 2\u00a0days postpartum. This trail is registered in the Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, number ChiCTR1900022464. RESULTS: Between 26 January 2019 and 15 July 2019, 502 subjects were screened and 330 were randomly allocated: 165 (50%) to the ketamine group and 165 (50%) to the placebo group. There were significant differences in the degree of postpartum depressive symptoms between subjects in the ketamine group and the placebo group at 1\u00a0week postpartum (13.1% vs. 22.6%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a0.029). However, no difference was found between subjects in the two groups at 2\u00a0weeks (11.8% vs. 16.8%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a0.209) and 1\u00a0month postpartum (10.5% vs. 14.2%, respectively; p\u00a0=\u00a0.319).

In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly.

Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as \u03b3-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-na\u00efve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations.

Here we used fMRI technique to inspect the DMN during the psychedelic state induced by Ayahuasca in ten experienced subjects. Ayahuasca is a potion traditionally used by Amazonian Amerindians composed by a mixture of compounds that increase monoaminergic transmission. In particular, we examined whether Ayahuasca changes the activity and connectivity of the DMN and the connection between the DMN and the task-positive network (TPN). Ayahuasca caused a significant decrease in activity throughmost parts of the DMN, including its most consistent hubs: the Posterior Cingulate Cortex (PCC)/Precuneus and the medial Prefrontal Cortex (mPFC). Functional connectivity within the PCC/Precuneus decreased after Ayahuasca intake. No significant change was observed in the DMN-TPN orthogonality.

However, NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent, transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children. Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist\u2010induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade \u2010along with limited clinical observations\u2010 suggest 1) that NMDA antagonist\u2010induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent (i.e., expressed postpuberty) and 2) that certain treatments \u2010like alpha\u20102 adrenergic agonists\u2010 may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity, with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha\u20102 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine\u2010induced psychotomimetic effects. We report on a double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled study of the effect of the alpha\u20102 agonist, dexmedetomidine, on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single\u2010dose, sub\u2010anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department (ED) setting. The study hypothesized 1) ketamine\u2010induced psychotomimetic effects, and 2) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a) younger age and b) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine. Methods: Children ages 7\u201017 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized (stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of <12 vs. >12 years\u2010of\u2010age children in each group) to co\u2010administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures. Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg), medical assessments, patient stabilization, and informed consent, participants were administered dexmedetomidine (0.7 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine. Adverse events were recorded using a clinician\u2010administered adverse events and side effects scale. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) was administered prior to ketamine dose, during ketamine treatment, and again prior to discharge from the emergency room, with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre\u2010ketamine to on\u2010ketamine condition. Cognitive testing was obtained following on\u2010ketamine BPRS ratings. Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA (ANCOVA when baseline values were non\u2010zero), using time as the repeated measure (pre\u2010 vs. during ketamine), and treatment condition (dexmedetomidine vs. saline) and age (<12 vs. >12) as independent variables. Results: Forty children (mean age: 11.0 years (SD = 2.3 years), 70.0% male, 22.5% black) were randomized to ketamine+saline (n =18) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine (n= 22). Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects, consistent with prior reports of dose\u2010dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans. BPRS positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, peculiar fantasies), absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment, were manifested during ketamine treatment, as indicated by a significant main effect of time (F[1,36] =19.98, p<0.0001). A trend\u2010level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed (F[1,36]=3.93, p =0.055), explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre\u2010treatment. Frequently reported (>5%, baseline\u2010corrected) side effects were sedation (56.3%), dizziness (50.0%), \u201cpleasant\u201d dreams (31.4%) and visual hallucinations (29.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that singledose, sub\u2010anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well\u2010controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures, with generally well\u2010tolerated adverse events, consistent with prior reports. However, ketamine treatment in children, as in adults, is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2) that pretreatment with alpha\u20102 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain.

Methods: Change in PTSD symptoms (CAPS\u20105) and functional impairment (SDS) were assessed by a central, blinded Independent Rater Pool at baseline and following each treatment session. Adverse events (AEs), concomitant medications, suicidal ideation and behavior were tracked throughout the study. Vital signs were measured during experimental sessions.

The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population.

Methods: All the subjects were preliminarily submitted to DSM-IV interviews and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). During a laboratory task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), subjects earned monetary reinforcers with repeated button presses, and were provoked by the subtraction of money that was attributed to a fictitious other participant. Subjects could respond by ostensibly subtracting money from the fictitious subject (the aggressive response). Escape responses were also possible protecting the counter from monetary subtractions. Results: Money-earning responses were not different in Ecstasy users and controls; aggressive responses were significantly higher in Ecstasy users in comparison with control subjects (F=20.74, P<.001). Baseline adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) levels were higher in Ecstasy users than in controls. No difference was found in norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) basal levels of the two groups. During the experimentally induced aggressiveness, plasma ACTH concentrations increased significantly less and NE and EPI levels, together with heart rate (HR), increased significantly more in Ecstasy users than in healthy subjects. Despite ACTH-blunted responses, CORT did not increase differently from controls in Ecstasy users. PSAP aggressive responses positively correlated with catecholamines and CORT changes, BDHI Direct Aggression and Irritability scores, both in Ecstasy users and controls. A significant correlation was found between Ecstasy exposure extent and aggressive responses (r=.78, P<.001). Implications: Our findings suggest that Ecstasy users have higher outward-directed aggressiveness than healthy subjects. Aggressiveness in MDMA subjects seems to be associated more with MDMA pharmacological effects than with personality traits: Nevertheless, a premorbid psychobiological proneness to aggressive behavior cannot be excluded. Increased catecholamines reactivity, basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, and blunted ACTH responses could be due to MDMA action on monoaminergic pathways and adrenal function. \u00a9 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

This is an update of a review first published in 2015 focusing on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability and tolerability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO all years to July 2020. \u00a0We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blinded randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing ketamine, memantine, esketamine or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (pill or saline infusion), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes were response rate (50% reduction on a standardised rating scale) and adverse events. We decided a priori to measure the efficacy outcomes at different time points and run sensitivity/subgroup analyses. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane tool, and certainty of the evidence was assessed using GRADE. MAIN RESULTS: Thirty-one new studies were identified for inclusion in this updated review. Overall, we included 64 studies (5299 participants) on ketamine (31 trials), esketamine (9), memantine (5), lanicemine (4), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), riluzole (2), atomoxetine (1), basimglurant (1), citicoline (1), CP-101,606 (1), decoglurant (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), rapastinel (1), and sarcosine (1). Forty-eight studies were placebo-controlled, and 48 were two-arm studies. The majority of trials defined an inclusion criterion for the severity of depressive symptoms at baseline: 29 at least moderate depression; 17 severe depression; and five mild-to-moderate depression. Nineteen studies recruited only patients with treatment-resistant depression, defined as inadequate response to at least two antidepressants. The majority of studies investigating ketamine administered as a single dose, whilst all of the included esketamine studies used a multiple dose regimen (most frequently twice a week for four weeks). Most studies looking at ketamine used intravenous administration, whilst the majority of esketamine trials used intranasal routes. The evidence suggests that ketamine may result in an increase in response and remission compared with placebo at 24 hours odds ratio (OR) 3.94, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.54 to 10.10; n = 185, studies = 7, very low-certainty evidence). Ketamine may reduce depression rating scale scores over placebo at 24 hours, but the evidence is very uncertain (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.87, 95% CI -1.26 to -0.48; n = 231, studies = 8, very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants assigned to ketamine or placebo who dropped out for any reason (OR 1.25, 95% CI 0.19 to 8.28; n = 201, studies = 6, very low-certainty evidence). When compared with midazolam, the evidence showed that ketamine increases remission rates at 24 hours (OR 2.21, 95% CI 0.67 to 7.32; n = 122,studies = 2, low-certainty evidence). The evidence is very uncertain about the response efficacy of ketamine at 24 hours in comparison with midazolam, and its ability to reduce depression rating scale scores at the same time point (OR 2.48, 95% CI 1.00 to 6.18; n = 296, studies = 4,very low-certainty evidence). There was no difference in the number of participants who dropped out of studies for any reason between ketamine and placebo (OR 0.33, 95% CI 0.05 to 2.09; n = 72, studies = 1, low-certainty evidence). Esketamine treatment likely results in a large increase in participants achieving remission at 24 hours compared with placebo (OR 2.74, 95% CI 1.71 to 4.40; n = 894, studies = 5, moderate-certainty evidence). Esketamine probably results in decreases in depression rating scale scores at 24 hours compared with placebo (SMD -0.31, 95% CI -0.45 to -0.17; n = 824, studies = 4, moderate-certainty evidence). Our findings show that esketamine increased response rates, although this evidence is uncertain (OR 2.11, 95% CI 1.20 to 3.68; n = 1071, studies = 5, low-certainty evidence). There was no evidence that participants assigned to esketamine treatment dropped out of trials more frequently than those assigned to placebo for any reason (OR 1.58, 95% CI 0.92 to 2.73; n = 773, studies = 4,moderate-certainty evidence). We found very little evidence for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators. We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that ketamine and esketamine may be more efficacious than placebo at 24 hours. How these findings translate into clinical practice, however, is not entirely clear. The evidence for use of the remaining glutamate receptor modulators is limited as very few trials were included in the meta-analyses for each comparison and the majority of comparisons included only one study. Long term non-inferiority RCTs comparing repeated ketamine and esketamine, and rigorous real-world monitoring are needed to establish comprehensive data on safety and efficacy.", "doi": "10.1002/14651858.CD011612.pub3", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34510411/", "secondary_title": "Cochrane Database Syst Rev"}

The authors' previous proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial of single-dose intravenous ketamine infusion in individuals with PTSD showed significant and rapid PTSD symptom reduction 24 hours postinfusion. The present study is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for the treatment of chronic PTSD. METHODS: Individuals with chronic PTSD (N=30) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive six infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) (psychoactive placebo control) over 2 consecutive weeks. Clinician-rated and self-report assessments were administered 24 hours after the first infusion and at weekly visits. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), from baseline to 2 weeks (after completion of all infusions). Secondary outcome measures included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and side effect measures. RESULTS: The ketamine group showed a significantly greater improvement in CAPS-5 and MADRS total scores than the midazolam group from baseline to week 2. At week 2, the mean CAPS-5 total score was 11.88 points (SE=3.96) lower in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group (d=1.13, 95% CI=0.36, 1.91). Sixty-seven percent of participants in the ketamine group were treatment responders, compared with 20% in the midazolam group. Among ketamine responders, the median time to loss of response was 27.5 days following the 2-week course of infusions. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated overall, without serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial provides the first evidence of efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions in reducing symptom severity in individuals with chronic PTSD.

TRD was commonly coupled with functional impairment, poor quality of life, suicide ideation and attempts, self-injurious behaviors, and a high relapse rate. From 2012 and 2015, we had conducted the first randomized, double-blind, placebo control trial in Asian countries to examine the therapeutic efficacy of a single low-dose ketamine infusion in Taiwanese patients with TRD. Seventy one subjects were evenly distributed in three dose groups with 0.5 mg/kg, 0.2 mg/kg, and placebo, respectively. Responder was identified by response (\u2265 50% reduction of mood ratings) at any two daily HAMD measures during the period of 24-96 h (day 2-5) post-ketamine infusion. There was a significant difference in the response rate across the three groups (0.5 mg/kg: 45.8%; 0.2 mg/kg: 39.1%; placebo: 12.5%; p = 0.03), which is much lower than that in the Caucasians (70%). Two factors might be related: lower serum ketamine levels and lower Val/Val allele percentage in BDNF Val66Met genotyping found in the Taiwanese patients. In addition to the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine, a greater antisuicidal effect (59%) was also identified. The former may only account for 52.7% of the latter, indicating that the antisuicidality may be independent from antidepressiveness. Single dose of ketamine only resulted in short-lived psychedelic/dissociation adverse effect, which was resolved within 2 h post-infusion. Up to present, no long-term side effects were identified, given a single-dose administration. Using 18F-FDG-PET scanning and 24 h post-ketamine infusion, glucose metabolism of the prefrontal cortex (PFC), supplementary motor area (SMA), and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) were activated immediately (40 min post-infusion), and activation of SMA and dACC could sustain for 1 day, which may contribute to the persistent antidepressant effect of ketamine beyond its half-life, suggesting that a short activation in the PFC engendered by ketamine infusion may be a kindler, facilitating the persistent increase in glucose metabolism in the SMA and dACC; therefore, the PFC may be still considered to play a key role in improving TRD. These findings were also supported by a simple wearable forehead EEG monitoring from baseline to 40 min post-infusion, revealing that ketamine may increase the theta and low alpha power and decrease asymmetry in the PFC. Finally, a maintenance trial in a double-blind, randomized fashion using a partial NMDA agonist, d-cycloserine (DCS) vs. placebo, was conducted in the ketamine responders. This DCS augmentation treatment was not superior to placebo in maintaining the initial antidepressant response to ketamine infusion, but DCS did appear to maintain the antisuicidal effect during the 6-week follow-up study. \u00a9 Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2020.", "doi": "10.1007/978-981-15-2902-3_11", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38633273/", "secondary_title": "Ketamine: From Abused Drug to Rapid-Acting Antidepressant"}

These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post\u2010traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double\u2010blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non\u2010stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self\u2010efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non\u2010stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "European neuropsychopharmacology"}

MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30\u2009mg. In session 2, a 1.5\u2009mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30\u2009mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean\u2009\u00b1\u2009SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8\u2009\u00b1\u200916.7\u2009ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0\u2009\u00b1\u20090.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2\u2009\u00b1\u2009170.9\u2009mg\u2009\u00b7\u2009h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4\u2009\u00b1\u20098.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6\u2009\u00b1\u20091.1% after 1.5\u2009mg/kg of MDMA (p\u2009=\u20090.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018\u2009\u00b1\u20090.028 to 0.998\u2009\u00b1\u20090.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p\u2009=\u20090.032 and p\u2009=\u20090.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6\u2009\u00b1\u200922.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6\u2009\u00b1\u200925.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6.", "doi": "10.2165/11584550-000000000-00000", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21456632/", "secondary_title": "Clin Pharmacokinet"}

Research suggests that diagnosis of, and living with a life\u2010threatening illness can result in symptoms similar to those seen in Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). 3,\u20104\u2010methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a monoamine releaser with a unique pharmacological profile that include decreased feelings of fear, increased positive mood and increased interpersonal trust. Findings from clinical trials in people with PTSD and anecdotal reports suggest that MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy may assist people who are anxious as a result of facing a life\u2010threatening illness. This randomized, placebo\u2010controlled pilot study of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy in 18 people with anxiety stemming from a life\u2010threatening illness examines the safety and efficacy of this treatment. This study will allow comparison between the impact of placebo and an active dose of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy on anxiety, depression, sleep quality, global functioning, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self\u2010compassion, and overall quality of life. Participants must be people of either gender aged 18 years or older diagnosed with a life\u2010threatening cancer or non\u2010dementing neurological illness and anxiety resulting from confronting this illness. Eighteen participants will be enrolled in the study. Five of 18 participants will receive placebo and 13 will receive MDMA. Therapy will be conducted by male/female teams, some of whom will be experienced therapists, and the others will be intern therapists under supervision of the Principal Investigator. In the first study segment, Stage 1, all participants will have two blinded experimental sessions of MDMA\u2010assisted psychotherapy scheduled at a two to four week interval, within a moderate course of non\u2010drug psychotherapy (preparatory and integrative sessions), after which they will complete the primary endpoint assessment. After the primary endpoint assessment, the subject and therapists will be unblinded and fully debriefed. Participants assigned to receive active dose MDMA will then receive a third open\u2010label experimental session with the same active dose of MDMA, which will complete Stage 1. Participants assigned to receive placebo will crossover, without completing Stage 1, to an open\u2010label study segment following similar procedures, referred to as Stage 2. Participants enrolled in this group will receive the same dose of MDMA as the active dose in Stage 1, with an optional supplemental half dose, at each of three experimental sessions at time points equivalent to those in Stage 1. Anxiety, depression, sleep quality, attitudes toward death, posttraumatic growth, mindfulness, self\u2010compassion, and overall quality of life will be assessed by participants' self\u2010report at baseline, the primary endpoint, and one month after the third experimental session in Stage 1, and at equivalent points in Stage 2. Additional assessments of depression and overall psychological functioning will be made by a blinded Independent Rater at these time points. A caregiver and individuals in close relationship to the study subject will also provide ratings of the subject's posttraumatic growth and mood. Symptoms, long\u2010term benefits, and harms will be assessed again at 6 months and 12 months after the final experimental session.

Methods: We combined state-of-the-art wireless electroencephalography with psychometric questionnaires to study the neural and subjective effects of naturalistic N,N-dimethyltryptamine use in 35 healthy and experienced participants. Results: We observed that N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly decreased the power of alpha (8\u201312 Hz) oscillations throughout all scalp locations, while simultaneously increasing power of delta (1\u20134 Hz) and gamma (30\u201340 Hz) oscillations. Gamma power increases correlated with subjective reports indicative of some features of mystical-type experiences. N,N-dimethyltryptamine also increased global synchrony and metastability in the gamma band while decreasing those measures in the alpha band.

OBJECTIVES: Here, we wished to investigate the effects of acute ayahuasca intake on neuropsychological performance, specifically on working memory and executive function. METHODS: Twenty-four ayahuasca users (11 long-term experienced users and 13 occasional users) were assessed in their habitual setting using the Stroop, Sternberg, and Tower of London tasks prior to and following ayahuasca intake. RESULTS: Errors in the Sternberg task increased, whereas reaction times in the Stroop task decreased and accuracy was maintained for the whole sample following ayahuasca intake. Interestingly, results in the Tower of London showed significantly increased execution and resolution times and number of movements for the occasional but not the experienced users. Additionally, a correlation analysis including all subjects showed that impaired performance in the Tower of London was inversely correlated with lifetime ayahuasca use. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ayahuasca administration impaired working memory but decreased stimulus-response interference. Interestingly, detrimental effects on higher cognition were only observed in the less experienced group. Rather than leading to increased impairment, greater prior exposure to ayahuasca was associated with reduced incapacitation.

METHOD: Thirty-five healthy volunteers with prior MDMA experience completed this two-session, within-subjects, double-blind study during which they received 1.5 mg/kg oral MDMA and placebo. Participants completed a five-minute standardized talking task during which they discussed a close personal relationship (e.g. a friend or family member) with a research assistant. The conversations were analyzed for selected content categories (e.g. words pertaining to affect, social interaction, and cognition), using both a standard dictionary method (Pennebaker's Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: LIWC) and a machine learning method using random forest classifiers. RESULTS: Both analytic methods revealed that MDMA altered speech content relative to placebo. Using LIWC scores, the drug increased use of social and sexual words, consistent with reports that MDMA increases willingness to disclose. Using the machine learning algorithm, we found that MDMA increased use of social words and words relating to both positive and negative emotions.

One year after surgery, the daily use of oral morphine equivalents was lower in the ketamine group versus the placebo group: 0 (0-20) mg versus 20 (0-62) mg, (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02), and fewer patients had a daily use of any analgesics in the ketamine group versus placebo group, 42% (95% CI 23-61) versus 74% (95% CI 58-87), (p\u00a0=\u00a00.04). Mobilization pain was lower in the ketamine group compared to the placebo group: Median difference 17\u00a0mm (95% CI -30 to -3), (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). Pain at rest was lower in the ketamine group compared to the placebo group with median difference: 13\u00a0mm (95% CI -23 to -3), (p\u00a0=\u00a00.01). Further, labour market attachment was better in the ketamine group, (p\u00a0=\u00a00.02). CONCLUSION: Intraoperative ketamine may reduce analgesic use, pain, and improve labour market attachment one year after spine surgery in a chronic opioid-dependent population. SIGNIFICANCE: This randomized clinical trial shows that intraoperative ketamine may reduce opioid use and pain and improve labour market attachment one year after spine surgery in an opioid-dependent population.", "doi": "10.1002/ejp.1317", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30246357/", "secondary_title": "Eur J Pain"}

Methods: 15 depressed subjects participated in a double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010 controlled crossover trial. Ascending doses (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5 mg/kg), with random insertion of placebo (midazolam), were given \u2265 1 week apart. Treatments were by IV (n=4), IM (n=5) or SC (n=6) injection.

Preliminary work has supported the potential of MDMA in psychotherapy for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The neurobiological mechanisms underlying its putative efficacy are, however, poorly understood. Psychotherapy for PTSD usually requires that patients revisit traumatic memories, and it has been argued that this is easier to do under MDMA. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) was used to investigate the effect of MDMA on recollection of favourite and worst autobiographical memories (AMs). Nineteen participants (five females) with previous experience with MDMA performed a blocked AM recollection (AMR) paradigm after ingestion of 100 mg of MDMA-HCl or ascorbic acid (placebo) in a double-blind, repeated-measures design. Memory cues describing participants' AMs were read by them in the scanner. Favourite memories were rated as significantly more vivid, emotionally intense and positive after MDMA than placebo and worst memories were rated as less negative. Functional MRI data from 17 participants showed robust activations to AMs in regions known to be involved in AMR. There was also a significant effect of memory valence: hippocampal regions showed preferential activations to favourite memories and executive regions to worst memories. MDMA augmented activations to favourite memories in the bilateral fusiform gyrus and somatosensory cortex and attenuated activations to worst memories in the left anterior temporal cortex. These findings are consistent with a positive emotional-bias likely mediated by MDMA's pro-monoaminergic pharmacology.", "doi": "10.1017/s1461145713001405", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24345398/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

Here, we used diffusion imaging to explore whether regional differences in white matter microstructure prior to treatment may predict clinical response 24 h following ketamine infusion in 10 MDD patients. Methods: FSL's Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) established voxel-level differences in fractional anisotropy (FA) between responders (patients showing > 50% improvement in symptoms 24 h post-infusion) and non-responders in major white matter pathways. Follow-up regions-of-interest (ROI) analyses examined differences in FA and radial (RD), axial (AD) and mean diffusivity (MD) between responders and non-responders and 15 age- and sex-matched controls, with groups compared pairwise. Results: Whole brain TBSS (p < 0.05, corrected) and confirmatory tract-based regions-of-interest analyses showed larger FA values in the cingulum and forceps minor in responders compared to non-responders; complementary decreases in RD occurred in the cingulum (p < 0.05). Only non-responders differed from controls showing decreased FA in the forceps minor, increased RD in the cingulum and forceps minor, and increased MD in the forceps minor (p < 0.05). Limitations: Non-responders showed an earlier age of onset and longer current depressive episode than responders. Though these factors did not interact with diffusion metrics, results may be impacted by the limited sample size. Conclusions: Though findings are considered preliminary, significant differences in FA, RD and MD shown in non-responders compared to responders and controls in fronto-limbic and ventral striatal pathways suggest that the structural architecture of specific functional networks mediating emotion may predict ketamine response in MDD.

Oral fluid is an important alternative matrix for drug testing, but little is known about MDMA detection windows in oral fluid. AIMS: The aim was to characterize MDMA and metabolite disposition in expectorated oral fluid after controlled MDMA administration. METHODS: Placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses were given double-blind in random order in separate sessions to 29 healthy adults with histories of MDMA use. One thousand two hundred eighty-six expectorated oral fluid specimens collected up to 7 days after dosing were analyzed for MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. The limits of quantification were 5 ng/mL for MDMA and MDA and 10 ng/mL for HMA and HMMA. RESULTS: MDMA was the primary analyte detected, with concentrations up to 12,000 ng/mL in 872 specimens (67.8%). MDA was quantified in 656 specimens (51.0%) at concentrations <403 ng/mL and was never present without concurrent MDMA. HMA and HMMA were not detected. Of the specimens, 59.8%, 58.6%, and 54.9% were found to be MDMA positive at the Talloires (20 ng/mL), Driving under the Influence of Drugs, Alcohol, and Medicines (25 ng/mL) and proposed US Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (50 ng/mL) confirmation cutoffs, respectively. MDMA was first observed in oral fluid 0.25-1.25 hours after dosing; MDA was initially detected at 0.5-1.75 hours. In general, the windows of detection for MDMA and MDA were 47 and 29 hours, respectively, although a few specimens were positive up to 71 and 47 hours.

In an effort to identify potential effects after serial infusions, we conducted a retrospective chart review to identify statistically significant changes in cognition in patient undergoing serial intravenous infusions; concomitantly, we examined baseline cognition as potential predictor of anti-depressant potential. METHODS: Twenty-two patients with TRD were examined after they finished the induction phase of 8-10 repeated intravenous ketamine infusions and completed the assessments of their depressive symptoms (measured by the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report Scale: QIDS-SR16) and cognitive function (measured by the Montreal Cognitive Assessment: MoCA) before the first and the last ketamine treatments. RESULTS: Repeated ketamine infusions administered through an escalating dose protocol with 8-10 infusion sessions produced a 47.2% reduction response in depression; there was no evidence of impairment as reflected in MoCA testing. There was a moderate association between baseline cognition and antidepressant response with a Pearson correlation of 0.453.

Emerging evidence indicates that psychedelics can exert antidepressant effects through multiple neurobiological and psychological mechanisms. However, it remains to be seen if these new treatments will revolutionize the treatment of TRD. AREAS COVERED: The present review focuses on the efficacy of serotoninergic psychedelics psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), ayahuasca, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) and mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine), as well as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), for TRD. A systematic search was conducted for psilocybin in TRD as emerging trials had not yet been subject to review. A narrative review summarized findings on other psychedelics. EXPERT OPINION: Psychedelic therapy has created a paradigm shift in the treatment of TRD, as it can maximize therapeutic benefits and minimize potential risks. Psilocybin holds promise as a potential game-changer in the treatment of TRD, with initial evidence suggesting a rapid antidepressant effect sustained for some responders for at least 3\u2009months. Nevertheless, further adequately powered, double-blind, comparator-controlled trials are required to explore and clarify the mechanisms of action and long-term effects of psychedelics in TRD. Psychedelics also hold promise for other psychiatric conditions, such as bipolar depression and post-traumatic stress disorder.", "doi": "10.1080/14656566.2023.2281582", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37947195/", "secondary_title": "Expert Opin Pharmacother"}

Few data are available about the effects of MDMA on the human brain. This study was designed to evaluate MDMA-related alterations in metabolite ratios with single-voxel proton (1H) MR spectroscopy. METHODS: Fifteen male MDMA users (mean lifetime exposure, 723 tablets; mean time since last tablet, 12.0 weeks) and 12 age-matched control subjects underwent single-voxel 1H MR spectroscopy. N-Acetylaspartate (NAA)/creatine (Cr), NAA/Choline (Cho), and myoinositol (MI)/Cr ratios were measured in midfrontal gray matter, midoccipital gray matter, and right parietal white matter. Data were analyzed with linear model-based multivariate analysis of variance. RESULTS: NAA/Cr (P = .04) and NAA/Cho (P = .03) ratios, markers associated with neuronal loss or dysfunction, were reduced in the frontal cortex of MDMA users. Neither NAA/Cr (P = .72) nor NAA/Cho (P = .12) ratios were different between both groups in occipital gray matter and parietal white matter (P = .18). Extent of previous MDMA use and frontal cortical NAA/Cr (\u03c1 = -.50, P = .012) or NAA/Cho (\u03c1 = -.550, P < .01) ratios were significantly associated. CONCLUSION: Reduced NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios at 1H MR spectroscopy provide evidence for neuronal abnormality in the frontal cortex of MDMA users; these are correlated with the degree of MDMA exposure.

RESULTS: A total of 541 people completed the survey (46.4% female, mean 34.1\u2009years old). One-third (32.2%; n\u2009=\u2009174) of respondents described new/increasing symptoms after psilocybin trips, prominently manic symptoms, difficulties sleeping and anxiety. No differences in rates of adverse events overall were observed between individuals with BD I compared to BD II. Use of emergency medical services was rare (n\u2009=\u200918; 3.3%), and respondents (even those who experienced adverse effects) indicated that psilocybin use was more helpful than harmful. Quantitative findings elaborated on perceived benefits, as well as the potential for psilocybin trips to contain both positively and negatively received elements. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective benefits of psilocybin use for mental health symptoms reported by survey participants encourage further investigation of psilocybin-based treatments for BD. Clinical trials should incorporate careful monitoring of symptoms, as data suggest that BD symptoms may emerge or intensify following psilocybin use.", "doi": "10.1177/02698811221131997", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36515370/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

Recent studies have proposed neuropsychoplastogenic effects as mechanisms underlying the enduring therapeutic effects of psilocybin. In an open-label study of 24 patients with major depressive disorder, we tested the enduring effects of psilocybin therapy on cognitive flexibility (perseverative errors on a set-shifting task), neural flexibility (dynamics of functional connectivity or dFC via functional magnetic resonance imaging), and neurometabolite concentrations (via magnetic resonance spectroscopy) in brain regions supporting cognitive flexibility and implicated in acute psilocybin effects (e.g., the anterior cingulate cortex, or ACC). Psilocybin therapy increased cognitive flexibility for at least 4 weeks post-treatment, though these improvements were not correlated with the previously reported antidepressant effects. One week after psilocybin therapy, glutamate and N-acetylaspartate concentrations were decreased in the ACC, and dFC was increased between the ACC and the posterior cingulate cortex (PCC). Surprisingly, greater increases in dFC between the ACC and PCC were associated with less improvement in cognitive flexibility after psilocybin therapy. Connectome-based predictive modeling demonstrated that baseline dFC emanating from the ACC predicted improvements in cognitive flexibility. In these models, greater baseline dFC was associated with better baseline cognitive flexibility but less improvement in cognitive flexibility. These findings suggest a nuanced relationship between cognitive and neural flexibility. Whereas some enduring increases in neural dynamics may allow for shifting out of a maladaptively rigid state, larger persisting increases in neural dynamics may be of less benefit to psilocybin therapy.", "doi": "10.1038/s41398-021-01706-y", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34750350/", "secondary_title": "Transl Psychiatry"}

The evidence for IV ketamine's specific effects on suicidal ideation is less clear, however. This study sought to examine whether differential placebo (saline or midazolam) response to overall depressive symptoms vs suicidal ideation may help explain these divergent findings. METHODS: Data for this participant-level integrative data analysis were drawn from 151 participants across 10 studies, and linear regression was used to examine the relationship between placebo response for suicidal ideation vs other depressive symptoms indexed from standard rating scales-specifically, depressed mood, anhedonia, anxiety, and guilt-over time. RESULTS: For participants receiving saline placebo (n\u2009=\u200946), greater placebo response was observed for suicidal ideation compared with other symptoms indexed from standard depression rating scales, except for anxiety. For those receiving midazolam placebo (n\u2009=\u2009105), greater placebo response was observed for suicidal ideation compared with depressed mood or anhedonia, and no significant differences were observed when comparing suicidal ideation with anxiety or guilt.

The infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine results in sub\u2010clinical schizophrenia\u2010like positive symptoms in healthy controls. The safety of ketamine use is attested by its daily use in child anesthesia and by a number of studies showing there is no medical, neural or cognitive complication after a single infusion. Low dose ketamine is therefore a valid and safe human model to study psychosis. The objective of the study is to characterise cognitive biases resulting from low dose ketamine infusion, used as a pharmacological model of psychosis. We designed four distinct paradigms designed to better characterize these biases. P1 is a neuroeconomic task where subjects have to make binary choices to maximize gains, in a situation where either direct feedback information or additional counterfactual information is provided. P2 is a neuroeconomic task where a direct manipulation of uncertainty is performed, and its impact on decision is measured. P3 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to classify a gabor orientation into the diagonal or cardinal category based on a rapidly presented series of individual gabors. The contribution of each piece of evidence to the final decision is measured and correlated to fluctuations in eeg data. P4 is a perceptual decision making task, where subjects have to determine the global orientation of a series of sequentially presented gabor stimulus. There are interim responses and final responses, the influence of the former on the latter (confirmation bias) is studied. Our assumption is that low dose ketamine results in reasoning biases by impairing the way uncertainty is monitored and taken into account for decision making. The study design is as follows : randomized, double blind, controlled, against placebo, cross\u2010over. Healthy subjects will therefore be randomized to receive on the first visit either a ketamine infusion or a placebo infusion. The alternative condition will be applied on the second visit. Ketamine will be prepared using KETAMINE PANPHARMA 250 mg/5mL, and infusion will be. This procedure should produce ketamine plasmatic levels of 140ng/ml. Two blood samples will be taken 30 and 90 minutes after infusion start to record actual ketamine plasmatic levels. Placebo infusion will follow the same pattern of infusion, prepared using CHLORURE DE SODIUM 0,9% MACOPHARMA. We will record both behavioral, electrophysiologic and psychometric data. Detailed assumptions are as folllows : Behavioral data : P1 and 2 : Significant impairment with ketamine in the ability to take into account uncertainty to guide decisions. P3 : Significant decrease with ketamine in the ability to classify correctly the mean spatial orientation of stimuli according to the cardinal or diagonal direction. P4 : Significant increase with ketamine in the confirmation bias following the interim choice. Electroencephalographic data : Correlation between the impairment in the ability to take into account uncertainty and the alteration of the Error Related Negativity and late inhibitory eeg signals, and decreased long distance synchrony as indicated by spectral analysis (P1 and 2). The covariation of brain activity with the weight each stimuli sample will have in the final decision, will be increased as a result of ketamine infusion (P3).

Due to delayed onset of action, currently available antidepressants are of limited utility in patients with MDD experiencing acute suicidal ideation (SI) with intent. In a recent proof\u2010of\u2010concept study, esketamine, the S\u2010enantiomer of ketamine, as nasal spray (ESK) plus comprehensive standard\u2010of\u2010care (SOC) demonstrated rapid improvement in depressive symptoms, among patients with MDD at imminent risk for suicide. A global registration program comprised of two phase 3 studies was conducted to confirm the efficacy and safety of ESK + comprehensive SOC vs placebo nasal spray (placebo) + comprehensive SOC in this patient population. This is the first drug development program for this important and understudied patient population for whom there is great unmet medical need. Methods: ASPIRE\u20101 (NCT03039192) and ASPIRE\u20102 (NCT03097133) were double\u2010blind (DB), randomized, placebo\u2010controlled, phase 3 studies conducted in adult patients (aged 18\u201064 years) with MDD (DSM\u20105 criteria and confirmed by Mini International Psychiatric Interview [MINI]) who had active SI and intent, required psychiatric hospitalization, and had moderate to severe depression with a Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score >28. Patients were randomized (1:1) to ESK 84 mg or placebo twiceweekly for 4 weeks (DB phase, days 1, 4, 8, 11, 15, 18, 22, and 25) along with newly initiated or optimized SOC antidepressant(s). During follow\u2010up phase, patients were monitored on days 28, 32, 35, 39, 46, 53, 67 and 90 after treatment. Primary endpoint: Change from baseline in the MADRS total score at 24 h post first dose. Key secondary endpoint: change from baseline in the Clinical Global Impression\u2010Severity of Suicidality\u2010Revised (CGI\u2010SS\u2010R) at 24 h post first dose. Treatment\u2010emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were monitored. Results: A total of 456 patients (ASPIRE\u20101: 226; ASPIRE\u20102: 230) were randomized (229, ESK + comprehensive SOC; 227, placebo + comprehensive SOC); 379 (83%) completed DB treatment. Pooled efficacy analysis set included 226 patients in ESK + comprehensive SOC group and 225 in placebo + comprehensive SOC group. Baseline characteristics were comparable between two studies and both treatment groups. The mean (SD) age of patients was 40.1 (13.00) yr and the majority were women (60.8%). Mean (SD) baseline MADRS total score was 40.4 (5.82). The majority of patients (90%) in both treatment groups were moderately to extremely suicidal, as measured by CGI\u2010SS\u2010R. Patients in the ESK + comprehensive SOC group showed improvement in MADRS total score vs placebo + comprehensive SOC group (difference of least squares mean [LSM] [95% CI]:\u20103.8 [\u20105.75;\u20101.89]) at 24 h post first dose. Treatment differences (LSM [95% CI]) based on MMRM for change in baseline MADRS total score at 4 h post dose (\u20103.4 [\u20105.05;\u20101.71]) and day 25, 4 h post dose (\u20103.4 [\u20105.36;\u20101.36]) numerically favored the ESK + comprehensive SOC group. Change in baseline MADRS score at 24 h post first dose also favored ESK + comprehensive SOC group for all prespecified subgroups. Difference (95% CI) between treatment groups in percentage of patients achieving remission (MADRS score \u226412) at day 25 (4 h post dose) was 13.1% (4.03; 22.19), favoring the ESK+ comprehensive SOC group. Although improvement in CGI\u2010SS\u2010R was observed in both treatment groups, estimated treatment differ\u2010ences were not statistically significant. All indices of suicidality numerically favored ESK+ comprehensive SOC at 4 h and 24 h post dose and day 25. Most common TEAEs (\u226520%) observed in ESK + comprehensive SOC vs placebo + comprehensive SOC group during the DB treatment phase were dizziness (38% vs 14%), dissociation (34% vs 6%), nausea (27% vs 14%), somnolence (21% vs 10%), and headache (20% vs 20%), respectively. Conclusions: In this first global registration program, treatment with ESK + comprehensive SOC demonstrated significant benef ts by rapidly reducing depressive symptoms in this vulnerable and heretofore understudied population. The severity of suicidality improved in both treatment groups, though the difference in improvement between groups was not statistically significant.

The neural basis for its therapeutic action is unknown. Here we report the effects of ketamine on the EEG of patients with treatment-resistant generalized anxiety and social anxiety disorders. METHODS: Twelve patients with refractory DSM-IV generalized anxiety disorder and/or social anxiety disorder provided EEG during 10 minutes of relaxation before and 2 hours after receiving double-blind drug administration. Three ascending ketamine dose levels (0.25, 0.5, and 1 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.01 mg/kg) were given at 1-week intervals to each patient, with the midazolam counterbalanced in dosing position across patients. Anxiety was assessed pre- and postdose with the Fear Questionnaire and HAM-A. RESULTS: Ketamine dose-dependently improved Fear Questionnaire but not HAM-A scores, decreased EEG power most at low (delta) frequency, and increased it most at high (gamma) frequency. Only the decrease in medium-low (theta) frequency at right frontal sites predicted the effect of ketamine on the Fear Questionnaire. Ketamine produced no improvement in Higuchi's fractal dimension at any dose or systematic changes in frontal alpha asymmetry. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine may achieve its effects on treatment-resistant generalized anxiety disorder and social anxiety disorder through related mechanisms to the common reduction by conventional anxiolytic drugs in right frontal theta. However, in the current study midazolam did not have such an effect, and it remains to be determined whether, unlike conventional anxiolytics, ketamine changes right frontal theta when it is effective in treatment-resistant depression.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyy032", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29718262/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

Preliminary evidence suggests that administering the glutamate antagonist ketamine with ECT might alleviate cognitive adverse effects and accelerate symptomatic improvement; we tested this in a randomised trial of low-dose ketamine. METHODS: In this multicentre, randomised, parallel-group study in 11 ECT suites serving inpatient and outpatient care settings in seven National Health Service trusts in the North of England, we recruited severely depressed patients, who were diagnosed as having unipolar or bipolar depressive episodes defined as moderate or severe by DSM-IV criteria, aged at least 18 years, and were able and willing to provide written consent to participate in the study. Patients were randomly assigned (1:1) to ketamine (0\u00b75 mg/kg intravenous bolus) or saline adjunctive to the anaesthetic for the duration of their ECT course. Patients and assessment and ECT treatment teams were masked to treatment allocation, although anaesthetists administering the study medication were not.

Methods: A 4-day electrocardiogram was recorded for 16 treatment-resistant patients with MDD and 16 age- and sex-matched controls before, and for the patient group only, after a single treatment with the rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine or placebo (clinical trial registration available on https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ with EUDRACT number 2016-001715-21). Circadian rhythm differences of HR and the root mean square of successive differences (RMSSD) were compared between groups and were explored for classification purposes. Baseline HR/RMSSD were tested as predictors for treatment response, and physiological measures were assessed as state markers. Results: Patients showed higher HR and lower RMSSD alongside marked reductions in HR amplitude and RMSSD variation throughout the day. Excellent classification accuracy was achieved using HR during the night, particularly between 2 and 3 a.m. (90.6%).

To test this hypothesis, we first administered a sub-anaesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.006 mg/kg/min) or saline in a single-blind crossover design in 14 participants while magnetoencephalographic data were recorded during a visual task. In addition, magnetoencephalographic data were obtained in a sample of unmedicated first-episode psychosis patients (n = 10) and in patients with chronic schizophrenia (n = 16) to allow for comparisons of neuronal dynamics in clinical populations versus NMDAR hypofunctioning. Magnetoencephalographic data were analysed at source-level in the 1-90 Hz frequency range in occipital and thalamic regions of interest. In addition, directed functional connectivity analysis was performed using Granger causality and feedback and feedforward activity was investigated using a directed asymmetry index. Psychopathology was assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. Acute ketamine administration in healthy volunteers led to similar effects on cognition and psychopathology as observed in first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients. However, the effects of ketamine on high-frequency oscillations and their connectivity profile were not consistent with these observations. Ketamine increased amplitude and frequency of gamma-power (63-80 Hz) in occipital regions and upregulated low frequency (5-28 Hz) activity. Moreover, ketamine disrupted feedforward and feedback signalling at high and low frequencies leading to hypo- and hyper-connectivity in thalamo-cortical networks. In contrast, first-episode and chronic schizophrenia patients showed a different pattern of magnetoencephalographic activity, characterized by decreased task-induced high-gamma band oscillations and predominantly increased feedforward/feedback-mediated Granger causality connectivity. Accordingly, the current data have implications for theories of cognitive dysfunctions and circuit impairments in the disorder, suggesting that acute NMDAR hypofunction does not recreate alterations in neural oscillations during visual processing observed in schizophrenia.", "doi": "10.1093/brain/awy175", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30020423/", "secondary_title": "Brain"}

They are prevalent and disabling, with high economic burden for society. Antidepressants have a delayed action and at least one third of patients do not achieve adequate response. The recent discovery of ketamine's unique antidepressant properties, with rapid onset of response and high rate of responders opens new perspectives for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHOD: The aim of this article is to summarize preclinical trials and clinical trials demonstrating ketamine antidepressant properties and to review the different modalities of use. RESULTS: Most clinical studies used ketamine with a single subanesthetic intravenous administration in patients with treatment-resistant depression, demonstrating a rapid but transient antidepressant response with high response rates. To prevent relapse and maintain the initial benefits, few studies have shown the interest of serial infusions of ketamine, while others combined ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy using the former as an anesthetic. So far, relay treatments with glutamatergic agents such as riluzole are disappointing. Although most studies were conducted in patients with TRD in recurrent depression or bipolar disorder, efficacy in acutely suicidal patients is promising. CONCLUSION: Our review highlights the increasing interest in the use of ketamine in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression. Although a widespread use of ketamine as an antidepressant in routine clinical settings seems limited by psychotomimetic effects and the lack of strategy to maintain initial benefits, ketamine or related drugs might be used to target specific conditions, such as bipolar depression or high suicide risk.", "doi": "10.1016/j.encep.2013.09.001", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24434008/", "secondary_title": "Encephale"}

In the last decade, it has been suggested that low dose of ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative ketamine infusion on postoperative mood score in patients undergoing Dilation and Curettage (D&C) under spinal anesthesia. We hypothesized that a single low-dose administration of ketamine infusion during D&C surgery can improve mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study included a total of 60 patients, \u226518 years, physical status ASA II, with up to 12-week gestation undergoing elective D&C surgery. Patients were divided randomly into a ketamine group (group K) and a control group (group C). In group K, 0.4\u2009mg/kg ketamine was given as a continuous infusion over 20\u2009min intraoperatively. Main Outcome Measure. Profile of Mood States (POMS) was recorded preoperatively and 2 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no differences in preoperative POMS between the two groups. Mean postoperative POMS of group K was lower than that of group C indicating mood improvement. Ketamine group patients showed higher sedation score and increased, although self-limiting, psychedelic phenomena than the control group. CONCLUSION: Observed data here support an acute effect of ketamine on mood but any further claim will be speculative.

Over 30 million people currently living in the US have used LSD, psilocybin, or mescaline. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the association between the lifetime use of psychedelics and current mental health in the adult population. METHOD: Data drawn from years 2001 to 2004 of the National Survey on Drug Use and Health consisted of 130,152 respondents, randomly selected to be representative of the adult population in the United States. Standardized screening measures for past year mental health included serious psychological distress (K6 scale), mental health treatment (inpatient, outpatient, medication, needed but did not receive), symptoms of eight psychiatric disorders (panic disorder, major depressive episode, mania, social phobia, general anxiety disorder, agoraphobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, and non-affective psychosis), and seven specific symptoms of non-affective psychosis.

RESULTS: 21,967 respondents (13.4% weighted) reported lifetime psychedelic use. There were no significant associations between lifetime use of any psychedelics, lifetime use of specific psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, mescaline, peyote), or past year use of LSD and increased rate of any of the mental health outcomes.

We investigated the long-term effects of MDMA use on cortical 5-HT neurons in humans and memory function, because brain 5-HT has been implicated in memory function. Methods: Twenty-two recent MDMA users, 16 ex-MDMA users who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, and 13 control subjects. The effects of MDMA use on cortical 5-HT neurons was studied by means of single-photon emission computed tomography with iodine 123-labeled 2\u03b2-carbomethoxy-3\u03b2-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]\u03b2-CIT) by quantification of brain 5-HT transporter densities.

Results: Mean cortical [123I]\u03b2-CIT-labeled 5-HT transporter density was significantly lower in recent MDMA users than in controls (1.17 vs 1.28 [-9%]) but not in ex-MDMA users (1.24 vs 1.28 [-3%]).

Greater use of MDMA was associated with greater impairment in immediate verbal memory. However, memory performance was not associated with [123I]\u03b2-CIT binding to cortical 5-HT transporters or duration of abstinence from MDMA.

Objectives A word pair learning task was administered to examine associative learning processes in ecstasy/polydrug users. Methods After assignment to either single or divided attention conditions, 44 ecstasy/polydrug users and 48 non-users were presented with 80 word pairs at encoding. Following this, four types of stimuli were presented at the recognition phase: The words as originally paired (old pairs), previously presented words in different pairings (conjunction pairs), old words paired with new words, and pairs of new words (not presented previously). The task was to identify which of the stimuli were intact old pairs. Results Ecstasy/ploydrug users produced significantly more false-positive responses overall compared to non-users. Increased long-Term frequency of ecstasy use was positively associated with the propensity to produce false-positive responses. It was also associated with a more liberal signal detection theory decision criterion value. Measures of long term and recent cannabis use were also associated with these same word pair learning outcome measures. Conjunction word pairs, irrespective of drug use, generated the highest level of false-positive responses and significantly more false-positive responses were made in the divided attention condition compared to the single attention condition. Conclusions Overall, the results suggest that long-Term ecstasy exposure may induce a deficit in associative learning and this may be in part a consequence of users adopting a more liberal decision criterion value. \u00a9 Springer-Verlag 2012.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-012-2652-x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22302139/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology"}

METHODS: A double-blind, randomized and comparative parallel-group study design was employed in 40 volunteers with ASA physical status 1 who were scheduled for elective superficial surgery under ketamine anesthesia. Dexmedetomidine (2.5 micrograms/kg, n = 20) or midazolam (0.07 mg/kg, n = 20) was administered intramuscularly 45 min before induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with 2 mg/kg ketamine intravenously, and muscle relaxation was achieved with vecuronium. After tracheal intubation, anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide/oxygen (2:1) and additional 1 mg/kg intravenous ketamine boluses according to clinical and cardiovascular criteria. Hypotension and bradycardia were treated by increasing the intravenous infusion rate of crystalloids and intravenous atropine, respectively. Sedative and anxiolytic properties, intra- and postoperative drug requirements, psychomotor and cognitive impairments, and cardiovascular effects were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Dexmedetomidine and midazolam proved to have equal sedative and anxiolytic effects after intramuscular administration, but dexmedetomidine induced significantly less preoperative psychomotor impairment and less anterograde amnesia than did midazolam. Compared to midazolam, dexmedetomidine decreased the need for intraoperative ketamine and was more effective in reducing ketamine-induced adverse central nervous system effects. Dexmedetomidine also was superior to midazolam in attenuating the hemodynamic responses to intubation and the cardiostimulatory effects of ketamine in general, but it increased the incidence of intra- and postoperative bradycardia. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that premedication with 2.5 micrograms/kg dexmedetomidine is effective in attenuating the cardiostimulatory and postanesthetic delirium effects of ketamine.

It is also used in non-medical settings to treat addiction. However, ibogaine has been linked to several deaths, mainly due to cardiac events called torsades des pointes preceded by QTc prolongation as well as other safety concerns. This study aimed to evaluate the cardiac, cerebellar and psychomimetic safety of ibogaine in patients with opioid use disorder. DESIGN: A descriptive open-label observational study. SETTING: Department of psychiatry in a university medical center, the Netherlands. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with opioid use disorder (n\u00a0=\u00a014) on opioid maintenance treatment with a lasting wish for abstinence, who failed to reach abstinence with standard care. INTERVENTION AND MEASUREMENTS: After conversion to morphine-sulphate, a single dose of ibogaine-HCl 10\u00a0mg/kg was administered and patients were monitored at regular intervals for at least 24\u00a0hours assessing QTc, blood pressure and heart rate, scale for the assessment and rating of ataxia (SARA) to assess cerebellar side effects and the delirium observation scale (DOS) to assess psychomimetic effects. FINDINGS: The maximum QTc (Fridericia) prolongation was on average 95ms (range 29-146ms). Fifty percent of subjects reached a QTc of over 500ms during the observation period. In six out 14 subjects prolongation above 450ms lasted beyond 24 hours after ingestion of ibogaine. No torsades des pointes were observed. Severe transient ataxia with inability to walk without support was seen in all patients. Withdrawal and psychomimetic effects were mostly well-tolerated and manageable (11/14 did not return to morphine within 24 hours, DOS scores remained below threshold). CONCLUSIONS: This open-label observational study found that ibogaine treatment of patients with opioid use disorder can induce a clinically relevant but reversible QTc prolongation, bradycardia, and severe ataxia.", "doi": "10.1111/add.15448", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33620733/", "secondary_title": "Addiction"}

The aim of this study is to investigate the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on functional connectivity (FC) using a novel multimodal method (Receptor-Enriched Analysis of functional Connectivity by Targets - REACT). This approach enriches the resting state (rs-)fMRI analysis with the molecular information about the distribution density of serotonin receptors in the brain, given the serotonergic action of MDMA. Twenty healthy subjects participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. A high-resolution in vivo atlas of four serotonin receptors (5-HT(1A), 5-HT(1B), 5-HT(2A), and 5-HT(4)) and its transporter (5-HTT) was used as a template in a two-step multivariate regression analysis to estimate the spatial maps reflecting the whole-brain connectivity behaviour related to each target under placebo and MDMA. Results showed that the networks exhibiting significant changes after MDMA administration are the ones informed by the 5-HTT and 5-HT(1A) distribution density maps, which are the main targets of this compound. Changes in the 5-HT(1A)-enriched functional maps were also associated with the pharmacokinetic levels of MDMA and MDMA-induced FC changes in the 5-HT(2A)-enriched maps correlated with the spiritual experience subscale of the Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire. By enriching the rs-fMRI analysis with molecular data of voxel-wise distribution of the serotonin receptors across the brain, we showed that MDMA effects on FC can be understood through the distribution of its main targets. This result supports the ability of this method to characterise the specificity of the functional response of the brain to MDMA binding to serotonergic receptors, paving the way to the definition of a new fingerprint in the characterization of new compounds and potentially to a further understanding to the response to treatment.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neuroimage.2019.04.007", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30953835/", "secondary_title": "Neuroimage"}

In a recent phase IIb study, COMP360 psilocybin 25mg was superior to 1mg on change from baseline (CFB) to Week 3 on the Montgomery\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score (primary efficacy endpoint), when administered alongside psychological support. Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology\u2010Self Rated (QIDS\u2010SR16) total score (exploratory efficacy endpoint) showed similar results. Objectives: To analyse changes in specific depression symptoms after psilocybin treatment in the aforementioned study, as measured by individual item scores on the MADRS and QIDS\u2010SR16 (range 0\u20106 and 0\u20103). Methods: Participants with TRD were randomised to single doses of psilocybin 25mg (n=79), 10mg (n=75), or 1mg (n=79). A remote, blinded rater assessed the MADRS at Baseline, Day 2 (the day post\u2010psilocybin), and Weeks 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12. The QIDS\u2010SR16 was self\u2010rated at Baseline, Day 1, Day 2, and Weeks 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 12. At each time point, descriptive statistics were calculated for each MADRS and QIDS\u2010SR16 individual item score. Results: At Week 3, MADRS items with the largest differences in mean CFB in the 25mg arm were Inability to Feel, Apparent Sadness, Lassitude, and Reported Sadness. Greater improvement in the 25mg arm was apparent from Day 2 and remained to Week 12 (Lassitude remained to Week 6 only). On the QIDS\u2010SR16, the item with the largest difference in mean CFB at Week 3 in the 25mg arm was in Feeling Sad and remained evident to Week 12 (Table 1).

The objective of this study was to describe psychiatric outcomes in patients who receive prehospital ketamine for severe agitation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted at two tertiary academic medical centers, utilizing chart review of patients requiring prehospital sedation for severe agitation from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients received either intramuscular (IM) versus intravenous (IV) ketamine or IM versus IV benzodiazepine. The primary outcome was psychiatric inpatient admission with secondary outcomes including ED psychiatric evaluation and nonpsychiatric inpatient admission. Generalized estimating equations and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare cohorts. RESULTS: During the study period, 141 patient encounters met inclusion with 59 (42%) receiving prehospital ketamine. There were no statistically significant differences between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts for psychiatric inpatient admission (6.8% vs. 2.4%, difference\u00a0= 4.3%, 95% CI\u00a0= -2% to 12%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.23) or ED psychiatric evaluation (8.6% vs. 15%, difference\u00a0= -6.8%, 95% CI\u00a0= -18% to 5%, p\u00a0=\u00a00.23).

It has been suggested that women are more sensitive to MDMA effects than men but no clinical experimental studies have satisfactorily evaluated the factors contributing to such observations. There are no studies evaluating the influence of genetic polymorphism on the pharmacokinetics (CYP2D6; catechol-O-methyltransferase, COMT) and pharmacological effects of MDMA (serotonin transporter, 5-HTT; COMT). This clinical study was designed to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and physiological and subjective effects of MDMA considering gender and the genetic polymorphisms of CYP2D6, COMT, and 5-HTT. A total of 27 (12 women) healthy, recreational users of ecstasy were included (all extensive metabolizers for CYP2D6). A single oral weight-adjusted dose of MDMA was administered (1.4 mg/kg, range 75-100 mg) which was similar to recreational doses. None of the women were taking oral contraceptives and the experimental session was performed during the early follicular phase of their menstrual cycle. Principal findings show that subjects reached similar MDMA plasma concentrations, and experienced similar positive effects, irrespective of gender or CYP2D6 (not taking into consideration poor or ultra-rapid metabolizers) or COMT genotypes. However, HMMA plasma concentrations were linked to CYP2D6 genotype (higher with two functional alleles). Female subjects displayed more intense physiological (heart rate, and oral temperature) and negative effects (dizziness, sedation, depression, and psychotic symptoms). Genotypes of COMT val158met or 5-HTTLPR with high functionality (val/val or l/*) determined greater cardiovascular effects, and with low functionality (met/* or s/s) negative subjective effects (dizziness, anxiety, sedation). In conclusion, the contribution of MDMA pharmacokinetics following 1.4 mg/kg MDMA to the gender differences observed in drug effects appears to be negligible or even null.

Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora between March and July 2018. Respondents who had consented, were 18 years of age or older, had experience with microdosing and were diagnosed with at least one mental or physiological disorder by a medical doctor or therapist (N = 410; 7.2%) were included in the analyses.

Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was significantly higher compared to that of conventional treatments for both mental and physiological diagnoses; and that these effects were specific for ADHD/ADD and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher, regular psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression, while for physiological disorders no difference was shown. Conclusion: This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physiological diagnoses is higher compared to conventionally offered treatment options, and lower than regular ('full') psychedelic doses.

FINDINGS: Over the course of treatment, 18% of the patients showed greater than 50% reduction in the Beck Depression Inventory II scores, 14% reported partial improvement in mood symptoms, while 45% had no response to ketamine and 23% showed a mild worsening in their depressive symptoms. The most frequent adverse effects were acute dissociation, dizziness, blurred vision, numbness and sedation. Neither serious adverse effects, nor any cases of abuse or dependence were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Although this case series found oral ketamine to be safe and well tolerated, the findings also showed rather modest effectiveness of oral ketamine in treatment-resistant depression, with only approximately 30% reporting some benefit and approximately 70% reporting no change or worsening of mood.

{"record_id": 6074, "keywords": "['Ketamine', 'Morphine']", "text": "Geriatric Ketamine for Pain Management Study.^\nElderly patients are making up a greater proportion of the New York State population every year as the nation's overall population continues to age at a rapid pace. Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non\u2010opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well\u2010being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an \"opioid\u2010free\" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double\u2010blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub\u2010dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 \u2010 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non\u2010traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on\u2010duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e\u2010mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition on all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research manager and statistician, who will be independent of any data collection.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02673372"}

This procedure proved to be less complex, shorter to perform and provides cleaner chromatographic characteristics than the method currently utilized by the Navy Drug Screening Laboratories for the extraction of LSD from urine by GC-MS. All of the specimens used in the study screened positive for LSD by radioimmunoassay (Roche Abuscreen(\u00ae)). Analysis by GC-MS revealed detectable amounts of LSD in all of the specimens. In addition, isolysergic diethylamide (iso-LSD), a byproduct of LSD synthesis, was quantitated in 64 of the specimens. Utilizing the new LC-MS-MS method, low levels of N-desmethyl-LSD (nor-LSD), another identified LSD metabolite, were detected in some of the specimens. However, all 74 specimens contained O-H-LSD at significantly higher concentrations than LSD, iso-LSD, or nor-LSD alone. The O-H-LSD concentration ranged from 732 to 112 831 pg/ml (mean, 16 340 pg/ml) by quantification with an internal standard. The ratio of O-H-LSD to LSD ranged from 1.1 to 778.1 (mean, 42.9). The presence of O-H-LSD at substantially higher concentrations than LSD suggests that the analysis for O-H-LSD as the target analyte by employing LC-MS-MS will provide a much longer window of detection for the use of LSD than the analysis of the parent compound, LSD.

Ketamine has been shown to be an effective treatment for numerous mental health disorders, although research on its efficacy in combat-related PTSD in veterans is very limited. METHODS: The study population consisted of 30 US military veterans with combat-related PTSD. Participants underwent a standard induction series of six 1-hour ketamine infusions with the goal of obtaining a transpersonal dissociative experience. Participants were given a series of self-report questionnaires to assess for changes in symptoms of depression, PTSD, and substance use prior to the first and sixth infusions. RESULTS: Symptoms of depression as measured by change in score on the Patient Health Questionnaire decreased significantly from an average of 18.9 to 9.5 (P < .001). Similarly, symptoms of PTSD as measured by change in score on the PSTD Checklist for DSM-5 dropped significantly from an average of 56.2 to 31.3 (P < .001). Self-reported levels of substance use did not significantly decrease during the study period, although the level of use trended down. CONCLUSIONS: This observational study suggests that high-dose ketamine infusion therapy, which induced a transpersonal dissociative experience, could be a valuable tool in the treatment of combat-related PTSD. Further study is needed to better elucidate ketamine's mechanism of action with regards to the treatment of PTSD.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "Ann Clin Psychiatry"}

Whether and how the quality of the psilocybin-induced experience might mediate beneficial health outcomes is currently under investigation, for example, in therapeutic applications. However, to date, no meta-analysis has investigated the dose-dependency of subjective experiences across available studies. Aim: Establishing dose-response relationships of the subjective experiences induced by psilocybin in healthy study participants and a comparison of patient groups. Method: We applied a linear meta-regression approach, based on the robust variance estimation framework, to obtain linear dose-response relationship estimates on questionnaire ratings after oral psilocybin administration. Data were obtained from the Altered States Database, which contains data extracted from MEDLINE-listed journal articles that used standardized and validated questionnaires: the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. Results: Psilocybin dose positively correlated with ratings on most factors and scales, mainly those referring to perceptual alterations and positively experienced ego dissolution. Measures referring to challenging experiences exhibited small effects and were barely modulated by dose. Conclusion: Psilocybin intensified almost all characteristics of altered states of consciousness assessed with the given questionnaires. Because subjective experiences are not only determined by dose, but also by individual and environmental factors, the results may only apply to controlled laboratory experiments and not to recreational use.

A key limitation for glutamate-based treatment development is the lack of functional target-engagement biomarkers for translation between preclinical and early-stage clinical studies. We evaluated the utility of 3 potential biomarkers-ketamine-evoked changes in the functional magnetic imaging (fMRI) blood oxygen level-dependent response (pharmacoBOLD), glutamate proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H MRS), and task-based fMRI-for detecting ketamine-related alterations in brain glutamate. OBJECTIVE: To identify measures with sufficient effect size and cross-site reliability to serve as glutamatergic target engagement biomarkers within early-phase clinical studies. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized clinical trial was conducted at an academic research institution between May 2014 and October 2015 as part of the National Institute of Mental Health-funded Fast-Fail Trial for Psychotic Spectrum Disorders project. All raters were blinded to study group. Healthy volunteers aged 18 to 55 years of either sex and free of significant medical or psychiatric history were recruited from 3 sites. Data were analyzed between November 2015 and December 2016. INTERVENTIONS: Volunteers received either sequential ketamine (0.23 mg/kg infusion over 1 minute followed by 0.58 mg/kg/h infusion over 30 minutes and then 0.29 mg/kg/h infusion over 29 minutes) or placebo infusions. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD, 1H MRS, and task-based fMRI measures, along with symptom ratings. Measures were prespecified prior to data collection. RESULTS: Of the 65 volunteers, 41 (63%) were male, and the mean (SD) age was 31.1 (9.6) years; 59 (91%) had at least 1 valid scan. A total of 53 volunteers (82%) completed both ketamine infusions. In pharmacoBOLD, a highly robust increase (Cohen d\u2009=\u20095.4; P\u2009<\u2009.001) in fMRI response was observed, with a consistent response across sites. A smaller but significant signal (Cohen d\u2009=\u20090.64; P\u2009=\u2009.04) was also observed in 1H MRS-determined levels of glutamate+glutamine immediately following ketamine infusion. By contrast, no significant differences in task-activated fMRI responses were found between groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings demonstrate robust effects of ketamine on pharmacoBOLD across sites, supporting its utility for definitive assessment of functional target engagement. Other measures, while sensitive to ketamine effects, were not sufficiently robust for use as cross-site target engagement measures.

One hundred and thirty subjects (41 ketamine users and 89 control subjects) underwent rsfMRI (resting-state functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging). Based on partial correlation functional connectivity analysis we partitioned the thalamus into six nuclear groups that correspond well with human histology.

We found that the ketamine user group showed significantly less connectivity between the thalamic nuclear groups and the cortical regions-of-interest, including the prefrontal cortex, the motor cortex /supplementary motor area, and the posterior parietal cortex. However, no increased thalamic connectivity was observed for these regions as compared with controls.

These substances induce cognitive, antidepressant, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive effects suggested to arise from biological changes similar to conventional antidepressants or the rapid-acting substance ketamine. The proposed route is by inducing brain neuroplasticity. This review attempts to summarize the evidence that psychedelics induce neuroplasticity by focusing on psychedelics' cellular and molecular neuroplasticity effects after single and repeated administration. When behavioral parameters are encountered in the selected studies, the biological pathways will be linked to the behavioral effects. Additionally, knowledge gaps in the underlying biology of clinical outcomes of psychedelics are highlighted. The literature searched yielded 344 results. Title and abstract screening reduced the sample to 35; eight were included from other sources, and full-text screening resulted in the final selection of 16 preclinical and four clinical studies. Studies (n = 20) show that a single administration of a psychedelic produces rapid changes in plasticity mechanisms on a molecular, neuronal, synaptic, and dendritic level. The expression of plasticity-related genes and proteins, including Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF), is changed after a single administration of psychedelics, resulting in changed neuroplasticity. The latter included more dendritic complexity, which outlasted the acute effects of the psychedelic. Repeated administration of a psychedelic directly stimulated neurogenesis and increased BDNF mRNA levels up to a month after treatment. Findings from the current review demonstrate that psychedelics induce molecular and cellular adaptations related to neuroplasticity and suggest those run parallel to the clinical effects of psychedelics, potentially underlying them. Future (pre)clinical research might focus on deciphering the specific cellular mechanism activated by different psychedelics and related to long-term clinical and biological effects to increase our understanding of the therapeutic potential of these compounds.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2021.724606", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34566723/", "secondary_title": "Front Psychiatry"}

MDMA produced a widespread decrease of slow and medium frequency activity and an increase of fast frequency activity in the anterior temporal and posterior orbital cortex, concomitant with a marked enhancement of mood, emotional arousal and increased extraversion. This activation of frontotemporal areas indicates that the observed enhancement of mood and possibly the increased extroversion rely on modulation of limbic orbitofrontal and anterotemporal structures known to be involved in emotional processes.

The visuospatial working memory task required participants to serially recall a spatial sequence while simultaneously completing a visual judgement task, and was completed on its own and under dual task conditions. RESULTS: Overall, non-users performed significantly better than both MDMA user groups. However, contrary to expectation, the performance decrement among users was no worse with concurrent random generation than under control conditions.

A recent randomized double-blind phase-IIb study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COMP360, COMPASS Pathways' proprietary synthetic formulation of psilocybin, in participants with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: While the phase-IIb results are promising, the treatment works for a portion of the population and early prediction of outcome is a key objective as it would allow early identification of those likely to require alternative treatment. METHODS: Transcripts were made from audio recordings of the psychological support session between participant and therapist 1 day post COMP360 administration. A zero-shot machine learning classifier based on the BART large language model was used to compute two-dimensional sentiment (valence and arousal) for the participant and therapist from the transcript. These scores, combined with the Emotional Breakthrough Index (EBI) and treatment arm were used to predict treatment outcome as measured by MADRS scores.

For the KET/DEX group, vehicle control (SV) and self-rated performance (visual analog scale), but not SDLP, was inversely associated with ketamine and norketamine blood concentrations (in nanograms per milliliter). Greater subjective effects were moderately associated with driving deficits. Implications/Conclusions: Driving simulator performance is significantly compromised after coadministration of analgesic range doses of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not fentanyl.

However, whether repeated ketamine infusions would cause short-and long-term neurocognitive impairments was not clear. Our aims were to investigate the neurocognitive effects of six ketamine infusions and to examine the association between these infusions and the antidepressant response in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. METHODS: Six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over a 12-day period were administered to 84 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Severity of depressive symptoms and four domains of neurocognition, including speed of processing, working memory, visual learning and verbal learning, were assessed at baseline, one day following the last infusion and again two weeks post-infusion. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found on speed of processing ( F=9.344, p<0.001) and verbal learning ( F=5.647, p=0.004) in a linear mixed model. The Sobel test showed significant indirect effects between time and improvement in speed of processing (Sobel test=3.573, p<0.001) as well as improvement in verbal learning (Sobel test=6.649, p<0.001), which were both significantly mediated by change in depressive symptoms.

However, ketamine tends to be abused by adolescents and young adults. In the current study, we examined the effects of early ketamine exposure on brain structure and function. We employed MRI to assess the effects of ketamine abuse on cerebral gray matter volume (GMV) and functional connectivity (FC) in 34 users and 19 non-users, employing covariates. Ketamine users were categorized as adolescent-onset and adult-onset based on when they were first exposed to ketamine. Imaging data were processed by published routines in SPM and AFNI. The results revealed lower GMV in the left precuneus in ketamine users, with a larger decrease in the adolescent-onset group. The results from a seed-based correlation analysis show that both ketamine groups had higher functional connectivity between left precuneus (seed) and right precuneus than the control group. Compared to controls, ketamine users showed decreased GMV in the right insula, left inferior parietal lobule, left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex/superior frontal gyrus, and left medial orbitofrontal cortex. These preliminary results characterize the effects of ketamine misuse on brain structure and function and highlight the influence of earlier exposure to ketamine on the development of the brain. The precuneus, a structure of central importance to cerebral functional organization, may be particularly vulnerable to the influences of early ketamine exposure.

Hence, in the present study, we investigate the therapeutic efficacy and functional brain alterations associated with multi-infusion ketamine augmentation in patients with TRBPD. METHODS: The present three-week study included 38 patients with TRBPD, all of whom received a series of nine ketamine injections over the study period. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) was used to assess the effects of multi-infusion ketamine combined with mood stabilizers. Brain function was evaluated by global functional connectivity density (gFCD). RESULTS: Adjunctive treatment with multiple infusions of ketamine, when combined with a mood stabilizer, could effectively alleviate depressive symptoms for one week, yet the symptoms began to relapse during the second week. Functional brain alterations were detected via gFCD. Specifically, gFCD reductions were mainly found in the bilateral insula, right caudate nucleus, and bilateral inferior frontal gyrus, while increased gFCD was mainly located in the bilateral postcentral gyrus, subgenual anterior cingulate cortex, bilateral thalamus, and cerebellum. Although gFCD alterations were sustained for up to three weeks after the first ketamine infusion, the antidepressant effects of ketamine augmentation sharply declined from the end of the second week of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: Multi-infusion ketamine augmentation can rapidly alleviate depressive symptoms in patients with TRBPD.

The Illicit Project is a neuroscience\u2010based, harm reduction program, designed to address this gap. The aims of this study are to describe the development, evaluation and scale of this intervention. Methods: An iterative, user\u2010centred design approach was followed with young people, to develop this innovative new program. A cluster randomized controlled trial was conducted involving 950 students (M = 15.9 years SD = 0.68; 60% Female) from eight secondary schools in Australia to evaluate the intervention's effectiveness in reducing the harms of substance use. All students completed a selfreport survey at baseline, 6\u2010 and 12\u2010months post\u2010baseline. Outcomes include alcohol and substance use, alcohol related harms and drug literacy levels (knowledge and skills). Results: At the 6\u2010month survey assessment, individuals who received The Illicit Project intervention were less likely to engage in risky alcohol use, MDMA use, early\u2010onset cannabis use and reported higher drug literacy scores compared to the active control group. The 12\u2010month results are currently under analysis and will be prepared by December 2022. Conclusions: As the foundation of future population health, preventing risky substance use and the related harms amongst adolescents undergoing formative stages of neurodevelopment, is critically important. These results support the preliminary effectiveness of The Illicit Project at 6\u2010month post program delivery. Further follow\u2010up will determine the durability of the results and inform program up\u2010scale.", "doi": "10.1111/eip.13408", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38634153/", "secondary_title": "Early intervention in psychiatry"}

METHODS/PROCEDURES: Post hoc analyses were conducted from a multisite, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial designed to assess the rapid-onset effects of intravenous ketamine. Patients (n = 99) were randomized to a single dose administration of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), or active placebo, midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (n = 19). Patients were stratified for BMI. For patients randomized to ketamine (n = 80), BMI was assessed as a continuous variable and also categorically (obese, overweight, not obese/overweight [reference]). The primary outcome measure was the change on the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 24 hours after treatment. Outcomes at day 3 were also assessed. FINDINGS/RESULTS: The 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change scores at 24 hours were inversely associated with BMI (-0.28 \u00b1 0.12, P = 0.02). With BMI operationalized categorically, both obese (-4.15 \u00b1 1.41, P = 0.004) and overweight (-1.99 \u00b1 1.14, P = 0.08) categories were inversely related to the 6-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale change score at 24 hours, statistically significant for the obese category, as compared with the reference group. Similar but weaker findings were observed at 72 hours after infusion. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Higher BMI and obesity were associated with a more robust acute antidepressant response to ketamine.

The feasibility and safety of administering low doses of ketamine as adjunctive medication during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to enhance ECT efficacy and mitigate cognitive impairment has attracted much attention. This study investigated the effects of low doses of ketamine on learning and memory in patients undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study recruited patients with moderate to severe depressive disorders who failed to respond to antidepressants and were scheduled to receive ECT. Participants were randomly assigned to a study group, which received an intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia, and a control group, which received isovolumetric placebo (normal saline) and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of depression after ECT. Before and after the ECT course, the Mini-mental State Examination and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision were used to assess global cognitive and learning and memory functions, respectively. Psychotropic effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Vital signs and other adverse events were recorded for each ECT procedure. RESULTS: Of 132 patients recruited, 66 were assigned to each group; 63 patients in study groups and 64 patients in the control group completed the ECT course during the study. Afterward, the incidence of global cognitive impairment in the control group was higher than it was in the study group. In addition, the decline in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision scale was greater in the control group than in the study group. The necessary ECT treatment times were shorter in the study group than in the control group (8 [7, 9] vs 9 [8, 10]). No significant escalations of the positive Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores or adverse events were observed in the study group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunctive medication, ketamine can attenuate learning and memory impairment, especially for short-term memory, caused by ECT performed under propofol anesthesia.

METHODS: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD ( n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects ( n=7). Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 7-12 months after the second dosing session.

A substantial proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment; e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always efficacious. Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high\u2010affinity antagonist of the NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and \u03bc\u2010opioid receptors. During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6\u20108]. These trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub\u2010anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post\u2010ketamine infusion [9, 10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration of improvement. D\u2010cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA\u2010R glycine site, with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS dosages, such as 50\u2010500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher dosages (500\u20101000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA\u2010R function, similarly to ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we reason that DCS post\u2010ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients when compared to placebo. Study Design 2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS\u226525%) after 6 ketamine infusions, ketamine administration (weeks 1\u20103: days 1\u201021) will be stopped and patients will start receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the following manner: 1. Week 4: Days 22\u201024 \u2010 250mg/d, one pill per day Well\u2010being assessment and adverse effect evaluation before drug elevation. 2. Mid\u2010week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25\u201042 \u2010 500mg/d, two pills per day 3. Week 7: Day 43\u201049 \u2010 750mg/d, three pills per day 4. Weeks 8\u201011: Days 50\u201077 \u2010 1000mg/d four pills per day 3. Pyridoxine 200\u2010300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the study. 4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study. 1. Patients will undergo 6 ketamine infusions within a 3\u2010week period. Intravenous ketamine will be administrated by a senior anesthesiologist and under the supervision of a senior psychiatrist hence ensuring patient safety. We believe that sub\u2010anesthetic ketamine infusion will be safer and will cause fewer side effects than ECT. The procedure will be explained in detail to each patient, and written consent will be obtained. After a psychiatric and medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist and a senior anesthesiologist, patients will be given ketamine nfusion added on to their antidepressant therapy. A slow ketamine infusion of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes will be given to the patients. Patients will be monitored by the experienced staff which includes a senior anesthesiologist and a nurse as well as a psychiatrist who will be available nearby. All patients will be monitored continuously for heart rate and rhythm and oxygen saturation, and blood pressure will be measured at 10 minutes intervals. Heart rate variability will be measured and analyzed after ketamine treatment. Measurements will be performed during the ketamine infusion at baseline, after 3 and 6 treatments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS). In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale (CGI\u2010S) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI\u2010I) will be performed 2 hours after treatment. In many cases, patients with depression also suffer from alexithymia: inappropriate identification of emotions. Alexithymia will be measured at baseline after 3 and 6 treatments. Ketamine infusion will be stopped in cases of a 20% or above increase in blood pressure or in heart rate over baseline values and/ or an acute dissociative state. Patients will be discharged to their homes at least three hours from end of infusion. Due to the potential effect of ketamine each patient will need to be escorted to and from the hospital by a family member or a friend.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT02772211"}

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of ketamine on preventing postpartum depression in women undergoing caesarian sections considering the relatively known positive effect of ketamine on major depression. The present double-blind, randomized clinical trial was conducted on 134 women undergoing scheduled caesarian sections. Participants were randomly allocated into two groups of control and intervention. To induce anesthesia, 1-2 mg/kg of body weight of Nesdonal and 0.5 mg/kg of body weight of ketamine were used in the intervention group, while only 3-5 mg/kg of body weight Nesdonal was administered in the control group. Data were gathered using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) in three stages: before the caesarian section and two and four weeks after the caesarian section. Data were analyzed using variance analysis with repeated measures and the Chi-square test.

We aimed to investigate the relationships between therapeutic alliance and rapport, the quality of the acute psychedelic experience and treatment outcomes. Methods: This 2-arm double-blind randomized controlled trial compared escitalopram with psychedelic-assisted therapy for moderate-severe depressive disorder (N = 59). This analysis focused on the psilocybin condition (n = 30), who received two oral doses of 25\u00a0mg psilocybin, 3-weeks apart, with psychological preparation, in-session support, and integration therapy. A new psychedelic therapy model, called \"Accept-Connect-Embody\" (ACE), was developed in this trial. The primary outcome was depression severity 6\u00a0weeks post treatment (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology, QIDS-SR-16). Path analyses tested the hypothesis that therapeutic alliance (Scale To Assess the Therapeutic Relationship Patient Version, STAR-P) would predict depression outcomes via its influence on the acute psychedelic experience, specifically emotional-breakthrough (EBI) and mystical-type experiences (MEQ). The same analysis was performed on the escitalopram arm to test specificity. Results: The strength of therapeutic alliance predicted pre-session rapport, greater emotional-breakthrough and mystical-type experience (maximum EBI and MEQ scores across the two psilocybin sessions) and final QIDS scores (\u03b2 = -0.22, R (2) = 0.42 for EBI(Max); \u03b2 = -0.19, R (2) = 0.32 for MEQ(Max)). Exploratory path models revealed that final depression outcomes were more strongly affected by emotional breakthrough during the first, and mystical experience during the second session. Emotional breakthrough, but not mystical experience, during the first session had a positive effect on therapeutic alliance ahead of the second session (\u03b2 = 0.79, p < 0.0001). Therapeutic alliance ahead of the second session had a direct impact on final depression scores, not mediated by the acute experience, with a weaker alliance ahead of the second psilocybin session predicting higher absolute depression scores at endpoint (\u03b2 = -0.49, p < 0.001) Discussion: Future research could consider therapist training and characteristics; specific participant factors, e.g., attachment style or interpersonal trauma, which may underlie the quality of the therapeutic relationship, the psychedelic experience and clinical outcomes; and consider how therapeutic approaches might adapt in cases of weaker therapeutic alliance.

In 4-week trials, esketamine nasal spray (NS) was efficacious vs. placebo when both were initiated in addition to a new selective serotonin or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor. However, comparison with an extended range of real-world treatments (RWT) is lacking. METHODS: ICEBERG was an adjusted indirect treatment comparison using propensity score-based inverse probability weighting, performed on 6-month response and remission data from patients receiving esketamine NS plus oral antidepressant from the SUSTAIN-2 (NCT02497287; clinicaltrials.gov) study, compared with patients receiving other RWT from the European Observational TRD Cohort (EOTC; NCT03373253; clinicaltrials.gov) study. SUSTAIN-2 was a long-term open-label study of esketamine NS, while the EOTC was conducted at a time when esketamine NS was not available as RWT. Threshold and sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess how robust the primary analyses were. RESULTS: Patients receiving esketamine NS had a higher probability of 6-month response (49.7% [95% confidence interval (CI) 45.6-53.9]) and remission (33.6% [95% CI 29.7-37.6]) vs. patients receiving RWT (26.4% [95% CI 21.5-31.4] and 18.2% [95% CI 13.9-22.5], respectively), according to rescaled average treatment effect among treated estimates. Resulting adjusted odds ratios (OR) and relative risk (RR) favoured esketamine NS over RWT for 6-month response (OR 2.756 [95% CI 2.034-3.733], p\u2009<\u20090.0001; RR 1.882 [95% CI 1.534-2.310], p\u2009<\u20090.0001) and remission (OR 2.276 [95% CI 1.621-3.196], p\u2009<\u20090.0001; RR 1.847 [95% CI 1.418-2.406], p\u2009<\u20090.0001). Threshold analyses suggested that differences between the two studies were robust, and results were consistent across extensive sensitivity analyses. CONCLUSION: ICEBERG supports that, at 6\u2009months, esketamine NS has a substantial and significant benefit over RWT for patients with TRD.

Outcomes of the treatment included increased ability to cope with LTI, reduced psychological symptoms, improved vitality and quality of life, and feeling more resourced.

MDMA is hypothesized to facilitate the therapeutic process, in part, by decreasing fear response during fear memory processing while increasing extinction learning. The acute administration of MDMA in healthy controls modifies recruitment of brain regions involved in the hyperactive fear response in PTSD such as the amygdala, hippocampus, and insula. However, to date there have been no neuroimaging studies aimed at directly elucidating the neural impact of MDMA-AT in PTSD patients. METHODS: We analyzed brain activity and connectivity via functional MRI during both rest and autobiographical memory (trauma and neutral) response before and two-months after MDMA-AT in nine veterans and first-responders with chronic PTSD of 6 months or more. RESULTS: We hypothesized that MDMA-AT would increase amygdala-hippocampus resting-state functional connectivity, however we only found evidence of a trend in the left amygdala-left hippocampus (t = -2.91, uncorrected p = 0.0225, corrected p = 0.0901). We also found reduced activation contrast (trauma > neutral) after MDMA-AT in the cuneus. Finally, the amount of recovery from PTSD after MDMA-AT correlated with changes in four functional connections during autobiographical memory recall: the left amygdala-left posterior cingulate cortex (PCC), left amygdala-right PCC, left amygdala-left insula, and left isthmus cingulate-left posterior hippocampus. DISCUSSION: Amygdala-insular functional connectivity is reliably implicated in PTSD and anxiety, and both regions are impacted by MDMA administration. These findings compliment previous research indicating that amygdala, hippocampus, and insula functional connectivity is a potential target of MDMA-AT, and highlights other regions of interest related to memory processes. More research is necessary to determine if these findings are specific to MDMA-AT compared to other types of treatment for PTSD.

BPD remains undertreated in the community and no medication has FDA approval for this indication. People with BPD experience chronic mood disturbances with depressed mood, suicidal ideation, and severe social difficulties. In this double-blind, randomized controlled pilot study, we tested the effects of one infusion of ketamine (0.5\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u200910) or the psychoactive comparator drug midazolam (0.04\u2009mg/kg, n\u2009=\u200912) in adults with BPD. Infusions were well tolerated in both groups. Dissociative symptoms during infusion were more intense with ketamine than midazolam (t(12.3)\u2009=\u20093.61, p\u2009=\u20090.01), but they resolved by 40\u2009min after infusion in both groups.

METHODS: In this randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial, 190 opioid abusers were enrolled. They were stratified into 2 blocks based on their daily opioid consumption. Both blocks were then randomized to receive 0.1 mg/kg IV ketamine (group K) or placebo (group P). Lithotripsy was performed under moderate sedation with intermittent bolus doses of remifentanil (0.2 \u00b5g/kg) to alleviate pain. The total remifentanil dose (primary outcome) and respiratory adverse events (secondary outcome) were compared in the 2 groups. RESULTS: Remifentanil administration in the group with low-opioid consumers was 1.6 \u00b1 0.4 \u00b5g/kg (group P) compared with 1.0 \u00b1 0.2 \u00b5g/kg in group K (confidence interval [CI](of difference) 95%, 0.4-0.7; P < 0.001).

Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order.

We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.

METHODS: Secondary analysis was conducted using a modified intent-to-treat sample pooled from two Phase 2 open-label trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial to compare efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for PTSD between BIPOC and non-Hispanic White participants. Four subgroups were of interest: MDMA-AT, BIPOC (n\u2009=\u200920); MDMA-AT, non-Hispanic White (n\u2009=\u200963); Placebo-assisted therapy (Placebo-AT), BIPOC (n\u2009=\u200917); and Placebo-AT, non-Hispanic White (n\u2009=\u200927).

Adverse events (AEs) on the day of (day 0) to 2\u2009days post-dosing were reported for each subgroup. RESULTS: In the MDMA-AT group, no significant ethnoracial difference in CAPS-5 change scores was observed. In the Placebo-AT group, BIPOC participants trended toward greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than non-Hispanic Whites. Among non-Hispanic Whites, MDMA-AT was accompanied by significantly greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than Placebo-AT. No treatment difference emerged among BIPOC participants.

Methods A cross-sectional survey of 98 active MDMA and/or hallucinogen users recruited through homepage advertisements, flyers, and word of mouth in Denmark. Lifetime and recent substance use and SPU at last recalled use was described by structured interviews. Hair samples from a subset of participants were analyzed for MDMA. Results The participants had used an average of 12.6 (95% confidence interval: 11.7-13.4) psychoactive substances during their lifetime.

If needed to reach/stay in remission, the participants will be provided antidepressant treatment in accordance with the regional guidelines for antidepressant treatment (https://psykiatristod.se/regionala\u2010vardprogram/ depression). At least monthly the participants will be asked to provide on\u2010line symptom rating data (via 1177.se).

After completing the study (one year or withdrawal), participants will be subject to standard care, including referral in accordance with regional guidelines. The study outcome measures will be used to assess depressive symptoms, clinical global functioning, functional disability, anxiety symptoms and health\u2010related quality of life. Safety outcome measures will be collected at all assessment time points from the time of consent through the end of study. To enhance participant safety, the current study proposes to test psilocybin within a \"set and setting\" (SaS) protocol similar to the protocol that has been used in all modern studies of psilocybin in both diseased and normal healthy populations. The SaS protocol for this study includes: 1) a preparation with session Facilitators (licensed psychologists) prior to dosing; 2) administration of study medications in an aesthetically neutral room under the supervision of two Facilitators who are present throughout the session (with the exception of short, temporary allowances for facilitator breaks; e.g. bathroom breaks); and 3) three post\u2010dose integration sessions during which participants are encouraged to discuss their intervention experience with the Facilitators. To evaluate the Facilitators' adherence to the study manual, and the role of Facilitators' and participants' in\u2010session behaviors for treatment outcome, all five sessions in the trial with Facilitators present will be recorded. The SaS will be identical for those randomized to psilocybin or niacin active placebo. Study Duration The planned maximum study duration for each participant will be approximately one year, with variation primarily dependent on the length of the screening period, the number of days between baseline and dosing, and the visit windows provided for each post\u2010dose assessment.

AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour.

That study and subsequent ones have demonstrated that low dose, infused ketamine is able to induce a remission of depression in patients who have failed conventional medications, within 24 h. The apparent increased efficacy and rapid onset of effect of ketamine distinguish it from all other current antidepressant treatments. However, a single infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine produces benefits that typically last <3 weeks. The infusions are associated with a transient \"psychedelic\" experience and increased blood pressure that requires monitoring. There is also a theoretical potential to induce ketamine addiction. These features limit ketamine's ability to be a widely used treatment for depression and thus limit is ability to have a meaningful impact on the heavy morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, despite its \"breakthrough\" rate of efficacy and speed of action. While growing numbers of clinicians are using ketamine to treat treatment resistant depression, many in the depression field believe that the aforementioned limiting aspects need to be separated from its remarkable therapeutic effects in order to unlock the breakthrough potential of this agent. To that end, drug development efforts have focused on various features of ketamine as targets for optimization including its modulation of the NMDA receptor, its pharmacokinetics, its chirality and its active metabolites including HNK (2R, 6R)-hyroxynorketamine.

However, a characterization of the outpatient population receiving IM ketamine treatment and an evaluation of the real-world depression, anxiety, and safety outcomes of long-term psychiatric IM ketamine treatment has not been reported. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical characteristics, treatment patterns, clinical outcomes, and adverse events of patients receiving IM ketamine treatment. METHODS: Patient data from the electronic health records of a private outpatient psychiatric clinic network in the United States were collected and analyzed retrospectively. Adults with any psychiatric diagnosis who received ketamine treatment only by IM administration from January 2018 to June 2021 were included. A total of 452 patients were included in the cohort. RESULTS: Patients receiving IM ketamine treatment had a mean of 2.8 (SD 1.4) psychiatric diagnoses. 420 (93%) patients had a diagnosis of major depressive disorder, 243 (54%) patients had a diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder, and 126 (28%) patients had a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder. Patients received a median of 4 (range 1-48) IM ketamine treatments.

Randomized controlled trials have failed to support these claims, but the laboratory-based dosing in trials conducted to date may have limited ecological validity. METHODS: Healthy male volunteers were randomized into lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (n\u00a0= 40) and placebo (n\u00a0= 40) groups and received 14 doses of either 10 \u03bcg LSD or an inactive placebo every 3 days for 6 weeks. First doses were given in a supervised laboratory setting, with other doses self-administered in a naturalistic setting. Results of safety data, blinding, daily questionnaires, expectancy, and pre-/postintervention psychometrics and cognitive tasks are presented here. RESULTS: The most notable reported adverse event was treatment-related anxiety, which prompted the withdrawal of 4 participants from the LSD group. Daily questionnaires showed credible evidence (>99% posterior probability) of improved ratings of creativity, connectedness, energy, happiness, irritability, and wellness on dose days compared with nondose days, and these effects remained when controlling for preintervention expectancy. No questionnaire or cognitive task showed a credible change between baseline and 6-week assessment time points. CONCLUSIONS: Microdosing LSD appears to be relatively safe in healthy adult men, notwithstanding a risk of anxiety. While microdosing elicited transient increases in scales associated with mood-elevating effects, it was not sufficient to promote enduring changes to overall mood or cognition in healthy adults.

METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audiorecorded guided mental imagery task 7\u00a0h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100\u00a0mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40\u00a0mg orally).

RESULTS: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased cognitive bizarreness (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001).

Methods: Three hundred and seventy-nine participants completed online surveys before and after a planned psychedelic experience.

Mixed effect models tested for changes in seven neurocognitive domains and antidepressant response, with post-hoc pairwise comparisons between timepoints, including follow-up. Relationships between change in neurocognitive function and antidepressant response over the course of treatment were tested with Pearson's correlation and mediation analyses. Associations between baseline neurocognitive performance and antidepressant response were tested with Pearson's correlation. RESULTS: Significant improvements in inhibition, working memory, processing speed, and overall fluid cognition were observed after the first and fourth ketamine infusion. Improvements in processing speed and overall fluid cognition persisted through follow-up. Significant improvements in depressive symptoms reverted towards baseline at follow-up. Baseline working memory and change in inhibition were moderately correlated with antidepressant response, however, improvements in neurocognitive performance were statistically independent from antidepressant response. CONCLUSION: Antidepressant ketamine leads to improved neurocognitive function, which persist for at least 5\u00a0weeks.

A diagnosis of stage IV melanoma can create great stress and anxiety for an individual and his or her caregivers. Psilocybin (4\u2010phosphoryloxy\u2010 N,N\u2010dimethyl\u2010tryptamine) is a psychedelic (hallucinogenic) compound found in certain species of mushrooms that can produce spiritual or mystical experiences and that has been used in psychotherapy prior to being made illegal. This study will be a randomized, active\u2010placebo controlled pilot study of the safety and efficacy of psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy as a means of managing anxiety in association with stage IV melanoma. This study will examine whether two sessions of psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy scheduled seen to 14 days apart will reduce anxiety, improve quality of life and be safe in people with stage IV melanoma. Subjects in this study will have a 66% chance of receiving the full dose of 25 mg psilocybin and a 33% of receiving 4 mg psilocybin. The first dose is expected to change how people feel, think and see the world, while the lower dose is expected to have only slight effects. Each subject will receive these conditions at random, as if by coin\u2010toss. The researchers, including the therapists, and the subject will not know whether they are assigned to get 25 or 4 mg psilocybin. The entire study can last up to three and a half months (14 weeks) but the main part of the study lasts six weeks. After the researchers determine that a person with stage IV melanoma and anxiety can be in the study, there will be two introductory psychotherapy sessions with the therapist\u2010investigators. They will prepare the participant for psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy. The subject will have a day\u2010long psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy session after introductory sessions, and he or she will remain overnight at the clinic. There will be a psychotherapy follow\u2010up scheduled the day after each psilocybin\u2010assisted session to help people work with the psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy, and there will be a psychotherapy session in between the first and second psilocybin\u2010assisted psychotherapy sessions.

The subjects will answer questions or fill out questionnaires about anxiety, depression, quality of life, spirituality and sense of self at the start of the study, two weeks after the second psilocybin\u2010assisted session and at least once during the study. Subjects will have blood draws to assess liver function before each psilocybin\u2010assisted session and they will have a blood draw to assess natural killer (NK) cells the day after each psilocybin\u2010assisted session. On the day after each psilocybin\u2010assisted session, subjects will also complete a questionnaire about their experiences during the psilocybin\u2010assisted session.

METHODS: On day 1, patients received a 40-min IV infusion of ketamine (.5 mg/kg) in an inpatient setting with continuous vital-sign monitoring. Psychotomimetic effects and adverse events were recorded repeatedly. The primary efficacy measure was change from baseline in the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score.

Method: 1029 adults were surveyed entering EDM parties in New York City in 2018. Those reporting past-year use of a drug were asked if they experienced a harmful or very unpleasant effect after use in which they were concerned about their immediate safety. They were also asked about co-use of other drugs and whether they sought help. Results: We estimate that a third (33.5%) of EDM party attendees have experienced a drug-related adverse effect in the past year. Two-thirds (67.8%) of adverse effects involved use of alcohol. Relative to use, adverse effects most commonly resulted from use of opioids (e.g., prescription opioid misuse, 41.2%) or alcohol (33.9%). Among those reporting an adverse effect, concomitant use of other drugs was common, particularly among users of LSD (56.5%), ketamine (56.3%), cocaine (55.7%), and ecstasy/MDMA/Molly (47.7%).

{"record_id": 2536, "keywords": "", "text": "A Randomized Controlled Trial of Repeated Ketamine Administration for Chronic Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic and disabling disorder, for which available pharmacotherapies have limited efficacy. The authors' previous proof-of-concept randomized controlled trial of single-dose intravenous ketamine infusion in individuals with PTSD showed significant and rapid PTSD symptom reduction 24 hours postinfusion. The present study is the first randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy and safety of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for the treatment of chronic PTSD. METHODS: Individuals with chronic PTSD (N=30) were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive six infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) (psychoactive placebo control) over 2 consecutive weeks. Clinician-rated and self-report assessments were administered 24 hours after the first infusion and at weekly visits. The primary outcome measure was change in PTSD symptom severity, as assessed with the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5), from baseline to 2 weeks (after completion of all infusions). Secondary outcome measures included the Impact of Event Scale-Revised, the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), and side effect measures. RESULTS: The ketamine group showed a significantly greater improvement in CAPS-5 and MADRS total scores than the midazolam group from baseline to week 2. At week 2, the mean CAPS-5 total score was 11.88 points (SE=3.96) lower in the ketamine group than in the midazolam group (d=1.13, 95% CI=0.36, 1.91). Sixty-seven percent of participants in the ketamine group were treatment responders, compared with 20% in the midazolam group. Among ketamine responders, the median time to loss of response was 27.5 days following the 2-week course of infusions. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated overall, without serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: This randomized controlled trial provides the first evidence of efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions in reducing symptom severity in individuals with chronic PTSD. Further studies are warranted to understand ketamine's full potential as a treatment for chronic PTSD.Reprinted from Am J Psychiatry 2021; 178:193-202, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing.

Studying the comparative and interactive effects of these agents may provide insights into the roles of the glutamate and monoamine systems in psychosis and cognition. OBJECTIVES: To directly compare the effects of ketamine and amphetamine and to explore their interactive effects within individuals. DESIGN: Placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind psychopharmacologic trial. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Forty-one healthy individuals recruited from the community who completed up to 4 test days. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: On each test day, participants received amphetamine (a 1-minute infusion of amphetamine sulfate, 0.25 mg/kg, or saline) and ketamine (a 1-minute intravenous infusion of ketamine, 0.23 mg/kg, followed by a 1-hour infusion of 0.5 mg/kg or an identical saline bolus and infusion). The order of amphetamine and ketamine infusions was randomized. RESULTS: At the doses studied, ketamine and amphetamine produced positive symptoms and euphoria. However, perceptual changes were produced only by ketamine, and hostility, grandiosity, and somatic concern were stimulated only by amphetamine. Amphetamine and ketamine produced conceptual disorganization, but only ketamine produced concrete ideation and unusual mannerisms. Ketamine produced negative symptoms and disrupted delayed recall. Ketamine and amphetamine showed 3 types of interactive effects: (1) amphetamine attenuated the impairment of working memory produced by ketamine; (2) amphetamine and ketamine had additive effects on thought disorder, arousal, and euphoria; and (3) amphetamine and ketamine had less-than-additive effects on psychosis. CONCLUSIONS: These findings implicate N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors and dopamine systems in psychosis. However, glutamate and dopamine may differentially contribute to psychosis, thought disorder, and euphoria. Regarding medication development for cognitive dysfunction, the pattern of the interactive effects of ketamine and amphetamine is consistent with the hypothesis that facilitation of prefrontal cortical dopamine levels would attenuate some cognitive impairments associated with deficits in N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor function.", "doi": "10.1001/archpsyc.62.9.985", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16143730/", "secondary_title": "Arch Gen Psychiatry"}

LSD was used in the treatment of anxiety, depression, psychosomatic diseases and addiction. However, most of the studies were not performed under contemporary standards, and it has taken several decades for a resurgence of interest in LSD research and its therapeutic potential for psychiatry. The aim of this review is to identify controlled and randomized clinical trials that assess the potential use of LSD in psychiatry. PRISMA guidelines for systematic review were followed. A literature search of PubMed and Psychedelic bibliography from Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) databases was performed as well as a manual search of references from evaluated studies. Only randomized-controlled clinical trials were included. Study quality was systematically calculated by using the Cochrane Collaboration Tool for assessing risk of bias. A final selection of 11 articles was made after considering inclusion and exclusion criteria. LSD was administered to 567 patients in a dose ranging from 20 to 800 mcg. Despite the design heterogeneity of clinical trials, positive results were observed, thus revealing the therapeutic potential of LSD to reduce psychiatric symptomatology, mainly in alcoholism. The vast majority of authors describe significant and positive short-term changes in patients, despite the fact that in some studies an important homogenization was observed between the LSD treatment group and control group at long-term follow-up. Multiple variables regarding LSD treatment therapeutic approach and quality of experience were revealed and related to therapeutic outcomes. LSD is revealed as a potential therapeutic agent in psychiatry; the evidence to date is strongest for the use of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. Despite the difficulty of designing proper double blind clinical trials with this substance, new studies that conform to modern standards are necessary in order to strengthen our knowledge on its use and open new doors in the future.", "doi": "10.3389/fpsyt.2019.00943", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32038315/", "secondary_title": "Front Psychiatry"}

Method: We conducted an internet survey of 394 adults endorsing DSM-IV-TR depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms. Sixty-four questions were utilized to inquire about demographic and clinical characteristics, illness course, substance use history, and treatment response. The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) was administered. The study was conducted from September 2005 to January 2006. Results: Compared to the ND group (n = 198), the D group (n = 196) included more male and younger individuals. The 2 most common precipitating drugs were cannabis and hallucinogens, followed by ecstasy. The majority of participants had modest use histories prior to onset and never ingested subsequently. The 2 groups endorsed similar illness course, impairment, suicidality, and limited treatment response. The D group showed significantly greater improvement over time than the ND group (P = .002), although the groups did not differ in reported psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy effectiveness. The groups did not differ in CDS total score or on the 4 subscale scores of unreality of self, perceptual alterations, unreality of surroundings, and temporal disintegration. On the numbing subscale of the CDS, the ND group scored higher (P = .009) only prior to controlling for age and gender.

Results: Studies were heterogeneous in the clinical populations included and ECT treatment and anaesthetic methods. Frequently, studies did not report on ECT factors (i.e., pulse-width, treatment schedule). Findings regarding efficacy were mixed. Tolerance from repeated use may explain why several studies found that ketamine enhanced efficacy early in the ECT course but not at the end. The majority of studies did not comprehensively examine cognition and adverse effects were not systematically studied. Only a minority of the studies reported on seizure threshold and expression. Conclusions: The routine use of ketamine anaesthesia for ECT in clinical settings cannot yet be recommended based on published data.

Little research has been done on pharmacologic interventions that could address this problem. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-asparate antagonist, has been reported to have antidepressant effects within hours. We examined the effects of a single dose of ketamine on suicidal ideation in subjects with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). METHOD: Thirty-three subjects with DSM-IV-diagnosed MDD received a single open-label infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and were rated at baseline and at 40, 80, 120, and 230 minutes postinfusion with the Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI), the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale, the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, and the Beck Depression Inventory. The study was conducted between October 2006 and January 2009. RESULTS: Suicidal ideation scores decreased significantly on the SSI as well as on the suicide subscales of other rating instruments within 40 minutes; these decreases remained significant through the first 4 hours postinfusion (P < .001). Ten subjects (30%) had an SSI score \u2265 4 at baseline; all these scores dropped below 4 (9 dropped by 40 minutes and 1 by 80 minutes). For those patients with a starting score below 4 on the SSI, only 1 reached a score of 4. Depression, anxiety, and hopelessness were significantly improved at all time points (P < .001).

In real life, however, MDMA is taken during the night, and driving may likely occur early in the morning after a night of \"raving\" and sleep loss. OBJECTIVES: The present study assessed the effects of MDMA on road-tracking and car-following performance in on-the-road driving tests in normal traffic. METHODS: Sixteen recreational MDMA users participated in a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled four-way cross-over design. They received single, evening doses of 0, 25, 50, and 100 mg MDMA on separate occasions. Actual driving tests were conducted in the evening when MDMA serum concentrations were maximal and in the morning after a night of sleep loss. RESULTS: The primary measure of driving, i.e., standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP, a measure of weaving) was significantly increased during driving tests in the morning in all treatment conditions, irrespective of MDMA dose and concentration. The increments in SDLP were of high clinical relevance and comparable to those observed for alcohol at blood alcohol concentrations >0.8 mg/mL. These impairments were primarily caused by sleep loss. CONCLUSIONS: In general, MDMA did not affect driving performance nor did it change the impairing effects of sleep loss. It is concluded that MDMA cannot compensate for the impairing effects of sleep loss and that drivers who are under the influence of MDMA and sleep deprived are unfit to drive.", "doi": "10.1007/s00213-011-2497-8", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21952668/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

Electroencephalographic (EEG)-derived measures have shown promise in predicting antidepressant response to a variety of treatments, and are sensitive to ketamine administration. This study examined their utility in characterizing changes in depressive symptoms following single and repeated ketamine infusions. METHODS: Recordings were obtained from patients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (N\u00a0=\u00a024) enrolled in a multi-phase clinical ketamine trial. During the randomized, double-blind, crossover phase (Phase 1), patients received intravenous ketamine (0.5\u00a0mg/kg) and midazolam (30\u00a0\u03bcg/kg), at least 1\u00a0week apart. For each medication, three resting, eyes-closed recordings were obtained per session (pre-infusion, immediately post-infusion, 2\u00a0h post-infusion), and changes in power (delta, theta1/2/total, alpha1/2/total, beta, gamma), alpha asymmetry, theta cordance, and theta source-localized anterior cingulate cortex activity were quantified. The relationships between ketamine-induced changes with early (Phase 1) and sustained (Phases 2,3: open-label repeated infusions) decreases in depressive symptoms (Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Score, MADRS) and suicidal ideation (MADRS item 10) were examined. RESULTS: Both medications decreased alpha and theta immediately post-infusion, however, only midazolam increased delta (post-infusion), and only ketamine increased gamma (immediately post- and 2\u00a0h post-infusion). Regional- and frequency-specific ketamine-induced EEG changes were related to and predictive of decreases in depressive symptoms (theta, gamma) and suicidal ideation (alpha). Early and sustained treatment responders differed at baseline in surface-level and source-localized theta. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine exerts frequency-specific changes on EEG-derived measures, which are related to depressive symptom decreases in treatment-resistant MDD and provide information regarding early and sustained individual response to ketamine.

Patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Bipolar Disorder (BD), Post\u2010traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD), and Borderline Personality Disorder (BPD) are at an increased risk for suicidal ideation (SI) and behavior, however very few psychiatric interventions have been found to be effective in decreasing the intensity of suicidality. We have previously shown that a single intravenous (IV) infusion of ketamine, a high\u2010affinity glutamate N\u2010methyld\u2010 aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity, including SI, in patients with treatment resistant major depression (TRD). The current study was designed to investigate whether ketamine, compared to a control condition, could decrease the severity of SI across psychiatric diagnoses. Methods: We conducted a double\u2010blind, randomized, controlled, pilot study of ketamine in inpatients and outpatients with clinically significant SI, defined as score of \u22654 on the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale item 10 (MADRS\u201010) for suicidality. Eligible participants included males or females aged 18 to 80 who were either admitted voluntarily to an inpatient psychiatric unit with acute worsening of SI or who were outpatients with chronic SI without acute intent to harm themselves. Exclusion criteria included lifetime history of schizophrenia or other primary psychotic disorder, current psychotic or manic symptoms, or current substance use disorder within 1 month of screening. Patients underwent measurement of SI and depression severity at screening and immediately prior to treatment. Patients received a single IV infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg) in addition to standard of care. Midazolam, a benzodiazepine anesthetic agent, was used in this study as an active placebo in order to mitigate threats to blinding. Change in suicidality was measured using the Beck Scale for SI (BSS) as well as the MADRS\u201010. The primary outcome time point was 24 hours following treatment. Patients were followed in person for at least 7 days and for up to 5 weeks via phone. Change in suicidal ideation from both screen and pretreatment time points to 24 hours was compared separately between the two treatment groups using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: Twenty\u2010four patients (10 inpatient, 14 outpatient) were randomized to receive ketamine or midazolam in a 1:1 scheme under double\u2010blind conditions. Primary psychiatric diagnoses included MDD (n=16), BD (n=4), PTSD (n=3) and BPD (n=1). The two treatment groups were comparable in terms of severity of the depression and SI at screening and at pre\u2010infusion baseline. The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7\u2010day follow up period. Five SAEs occurred during the study, including re\u2010hospitalization for worsening psychiatric symptoms (n=4) and one patient who expired from causes deemed unrelated to the study intervention. The most common non\u2010serious adverse event reported in the ketamine group was headache (58.3%). Patients who received ketamine experienced transient dissociative symptoms measured by the Clinician Administered Dissociative Scale (CADSS) (mean 17.08\u00b119.86), which resolved within 4 hours of the treatment. SI was lower in the ketamine compared to midazolam group at 24 hours post\u2010treatment as measured by the BSS (9.33\u00b17.9 and 14.1\u00b18.4, respectively) and MADRS\u201010 (1.75\u00b11.86 and 3.25\u00b11.6, respectively). For change in BSS from screen to 24 hours, there was a significant main effect of time [F(1,22)=25.4, p<0.001] and a trend\u2010level time x treatment interaction [F(1,22)=3.02, p=0.096). For change from pre\u2010treatment to 24 hours, the effect was similar (p=0.15). For change in MADRS\u201010 from screen to 24 hours, there was a significant main effect of time [F(1,22)=30.3, p<0.001] and significant time x reatment interaction [F(1,22)=8.6, p=0.008]. For change in MADRS\u201010 from pre\u2010treatment to 24 hours, there was a significant main effect of time [F(1,22)=15.7, p=0.001] and trend\u2010level time x treatment interaction [F(1,22)=4.2, p=0.053]. Conclusions: The findings of the current study provide initial support for the safety, tolerability, and preliminary efficacy of ketamine as an intervention for SI in patients who are at elevated risk for suicidal behavior across psychiatric diagnoses. If these findings are replicated and extended in rigorous controlled trials, this line of research may have robust implications for clinical practice and public health. Larger, well\u2010controlled studies are required to further characterize the safety and efficacy of ketamine for SI.", "doi": "10.1038/npp.2014.281", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/38500146/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

In the original article, there was an error as one of the reviewers did not endorse the final version of the article. This correction is made to remove this individual as an endorsing reviewer on the article. The final, published article has been endorsed by the Specialty Chief Editor, the Associate Editor and the remaining reviewer. The original article has been updated. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2018-36570-001[/rid]). Ketamine is a popular recreational drug among young people in Hong Kong. Long-term abuse of ketamine can lead to acute urological and medical issues, which often require immediate care at emergency rooms. Many patients require short-term hospitalization for medical management. This opens a brief time window, within which mental health professionals could engage young people who abuses ketamine in psychosocial, functional, and lifestyle interventions. The Crisis Accommodation Program (CAP) is a short-term hospitalization and community support program that addresses the health care needs of young people who abuse ketamine. During short-term hospitalization, the patient participates in a range of cognitive and psychosocial assessments, motivational interviewing, emotions management, and lifestyle re-design interventions. Upon discharge, social work professionals of non-government agencies continue to work with the patients on their action plans in the community. This evaluation study uses a quasi-experimental non-equivalent group design, in which the outcomes of the treatment group (n = 84) are compared with a comparison group (n = 34) who have a history of ketamine abuse but who have not joined the treatment program. The results confirm that the treatment group showed significant increases in motivation for treatment, reduction in drug use, improvement in cognitive screening tests, healthy lifestyle scores, and self-efficacy in avoidance of drugs over 13 weeks. When compared with the comparison group, the treatment group had significant decreases in anxiety and treatment needs and had moved from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage. However, there were no significant changes in outcome measures covering lifestyle or self-efficacy in drug avoidance. Overall, the CAP is effective in reducing drug use, anxiety, and helping patients to move from pre-contemplation to the contemplation or preparation stage of change. The study results suggest that health care professionals can successfully engage young people who abuse ketamine to participate in a package of psychosocial interventions, motivational interviewing, and lifestyle re-design during their hospital stay for management of urological problems. The CAP also highlights the importance of collaboration between hospitals and community social services in the management of addiction.

Conventional monoaminergic antidepressants have limited efficacy and take weeks to exert a therapeutic effect. Single infusions of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine exhibit rapid antidepressant action but effects are transient and relapse is common. One potential strategy for increasing ketamine's antidepressant efficacy and/or prolonging its therapeutic benefit may be serial infusions. There is limited evidence on the efficacy and safety of repeated ketamine infusions against an active comparator. METHODS: This protocol describes an ongoing pragmatic, randomised, controlled, parallel-group, patient- and rater-blind, superiority trial. Eligible adult inpatients with a confirmed DSM-5 diagnosis of a major depressive episode (unipolar or bipolar) are randomly allocated in a 1:1 ratio to a course of up to eight infusions of ketamine or midazolam twice-weekly over four weeks. The primary objective is to assess the efficacy of serial adjunctive ketamine infusions versus active comparator midazolam by measuring Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score difference between arms from before the first infusion to 24\u00a0h after the final infusion, supplemented by a 95% confidence interval. To facilitate generalisability of results, the trial takes place under \"real world\" conditions with both groups continuing to receive regular inpatient care including treatment-as-usual pharmacotherapy, nursing care, and psychological and other therapies during the randomised treatment phase and regular outpatient care thereafter. Participants are monitored for relapse during a 24-week follow-up after the end of the randomised phase. Secondary objectives of the trial are to assess: response and remission rates at the end of randomised phase; relapse status during the 24-week follow-up after the end of the randomised phase; the safety and tolerability of repeated ketamine infusions regarding psychotomimetic and other psychiatric side effects, cognitive side effects, as well as withdrawal symptoms, haemodynamic stability, neurological, urological, and other physical side effects; and quality of life and cost-effectiveness. DISCUSSION: There is an unmet clinical need for rapidly-acting novel antidepressants. This trial will provide efficacy, safety and health economic data on serial ketamine infusions and thus help inform clinical practice on the potential role of this treatment in the management of depression.

However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881106065859", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16714323/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

Among all perceptual changes induced by Ayahuasca, the most remarkable are vivid \"seeings.\" During such seeings, users report potent imagery. Using functional magnetic resonance imaging during a closed-eyes imagery task, we found that Ayahuasca produces a robust increase in the activation of several occipital, temporal, and frontal areas. In the primary visual area, the effect was comparable in magnitude to the activation levels of natural image with the eyes open. Importantly, this effect was specifically correlated with the occurrence of individual perceptual changes measured by psychiatric scales. The activity of cortical areas BA30 and BA37, known to be involved with episodic memory and the processing of contextual associations, was also potentiated by Ayahuasca intake during imagery. Finally, we detected a positive modulation by Ayahuasca of BA 10, a frontal area involved with intentional prospective imagination, working memory and the processing of information from internal sources. Therefore, our results indicate that Ayahuasca seeings stem from the activation of an extensive network generally involved with vision, memory, and intention. By boosting the intensity of recalled images to the same level of natural image, Ayahuasca lends a status of reality to inner experiences. It is therefore understandable why Ayahuasca was culturally selected over many centuries by rain forest shamans to facilitate mystical revelations of visual nature. \u00a9 2011 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.", "doi": "10.1002/hbm.21381", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21922603/", "secondary_title": "Human Brain Mapping"}

This tea contains measurable amounts of the psychotropic indole N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and beta-carboline alkaloids with MAO-inhibiting properties. In a previous report we described a profile of stimulant and psychedelic effects for ayahuasca as measured by subjective report self-assessment instruments.

METHODS: Two doses (one low and one high) of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca, equivalent to 0.6 and 0.85 mg DMT kg(-1) body weight, were administered to 18 healthy volunteers with previous experience in psychedelic drug use in a double-blind crossover placebo-controlled clinical trial. Nineteen-lead recordings were undertaken from baseline to 8 h after administration. Subjective effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). RESULTS: Ayahuasca induced a pattern of psychoactive effects which resulted in significant dose-dependent increases in all subscales of the HRS, and in significant and dose-dependent modifications of brain electrical activity. Absolute power decreased in all frequency bands, most prominently in the theta band. Mean absolute power decreases (95% CI) at a representative lead (P3) 90 min after the high dose were -20.20+/-15.23 microV2 and -2.70+/-2.21 microV2 for total power and theta power, respectively. Relative power decreased in the delta (-1.20+/-1.31% after 120 min at P3) and theta (-3.30+/-2.59% after 120 min at P3) bands, and increased in the beta band, most prominently in the faster beta-3 (1.00+/-0.88% after 90 min at P3) and beta-4 (0.30+/-0.24% after 90 min at P3) subbands. Finally, an increase was also seen for the centroid of the total activity and its deviation. EEG modifications began as early as 15-30 min, reached a peak between 45 and 120 min and decreased thereafter to return to baseline levels at 4-6 h after administration. CONCLUSIONS: The central effects of ayahuasca could be objectively measured by means of q-EEG, showing a time pattern which closely paralleled that of previously reported subjective effects. The modifications seen for the individual q-EEG variables were in line with those previously described for other serotonergic psychedelics and share some features with the profile of effects shown by pro-serotonergic and pro-dopaminergic drugs. The q-EEG profile supports the role of 5-HT2 and dopamine D2-receptor agonism in mediating the effects of ayahuasca on the central nervous system.", "doi": "10.1046/j.1365-2125.2002.01609.x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12047486/", "secondary_title": "Br J Clin Pharmacol"}

A systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a predominant agonist of 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A/C) receptors and was first isolated in 1958, shortly before it became a controlled substance. Research on the potential therapeutic effects of this compound has recently re-emerged alongside what is being addressed as a psychedelic renaissance. METHODS: In this paper we performed a systematic review of the clinical trials conducted so far regarding the therapeutic effects of psilocybin on psychiatric disorders. The eligibility criteria included clinical trials that assessed psilocybin's potential therapeutic effects on patients with psychiatric disorders. Nine hundred seven articles were found and screened in regard to the title, from which 94 were screened through abstract and 9 met the eligibility criteria and were included. RESULTS: The papers published focused on 3 disorders: depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorder (namely tobacco and alcohol). Psilocybin has shown a relatively safe profile and very promising results, with reductions found on most of the psychiatric rating scales' scores. Research on depression showed the most solid evidence, supported by 3 randomized controlled trials. Studies on OCD and substance use disorder showed more limitations due to their open-label design. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the results from the studies reviewed in this paper suggest a substantial therapeutic potential. This calls for further research to confirm the results observed so far and further explain the underlying mechanisms.", "doi": "10.1097/j.pbj.0000000000000128", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33884324/", "secondary_title": "Porto Biomed J"}

In these settings, ketamine's psychedelic effects are viewed as undesirable \"side effects.\" In contrast, we believe ketamine can benefit patients with a wide variety of diagnoses when administered with psychotherapy and using its psychedelic properties without need for intravenous (IV) access. Its proven safety over decades of use makes it ideal for office and supervised at-home use. The unique experience that ketamine facilitates with its biological, experiential, and psychological impacts has been tailored to optimize office-based treatment evolving into a method that we call Ketamine Assisted Psychotherapy (KAP).

Ketamine, a Glutamate modulator and a rapidly acting antidepressant with anti-suicidal properties, might offer relief. AIMS: Evaluation of single, fixed-dosed intranasal ketamine for acute suicidal ideation in the emergency department. METHODS: Between August 2016 and April 2018, 30 eligible suicidal subjects, scheduled for psychiatric hospitalization, independently of their psychiatric diagnosis, were randomized to intranasal ketamine 40\u2009mg or saline placebo. Safety and efficacy evaluations were scheduled for 30, 60, 120 and 240\u2009min post administration and on days 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 21 and 28. Primary outcome was suicidal ideation.

To maximize ability to compare to previous and future work, we performed secondary region of interest (ROI)-to-ROI functional connectivity analyses on these data, using two granularities of scale for ROIs.

Generally, adults diagnosed with ADHD have lower levels of mindfulness and differ in personality structure from non-ADHD adults. How MD affects mindfulness and personality in adults with ADHD remains unexplored. AIM: This study aimed to investigate the effects of 4\u2009weeks of MD on mindfulness and personality traits in adults diagnosed with ADHD and those experiencing severe ADHD symptoms. It was expected that mindfulness and the personality traits conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and openness would increase and neuroticism would decrease after 4\u2009weeks of MD compared to baseline. It was explored if using conventional ADHD medication alongside MD and/or having comorbidities influenced MD-induced effects. METHODS: An online prospective naturalistic design was used to measure participants before MD initiation and 2 and 4\u2009weeks later. Validated self-report measures were used assessing mindfulness (15-item Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire) and personality traits (10-item version of the Big Five Inventory) at three time points. RESULTS: The sample included n\u2009=\u2009233, n\u2009=\u200966, and n\u2009=\u200944 participants at the three time points, respectively. Trait mindfulness, specifically description and non-judging of inner experience, was increased, and neuroticism was decreased after 4\u2009weeks of MD compared to baseline. The remaining personality traits remained unchanged. Using conventional medication and/or having comorbid diagnoses did not change the MD-induced effects on mindfulness and personality traits after 4\u2009weeks. CONCLUSION: MD induced changes in otherwise stable traits.

The aim of this study was to develop and validate a liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of LSD, iso-LSD, 2-oxo-3-hydroxy LSD (O-H-LSD), and nor-LSD in plasma samples from 24\u00a0healthy subjects after controlled administration of 100\u00a0\u03bcg LSD in a clinical trial. In addition, metabolites that have been recently described in in vitro studies, including lysergic acid monoethylamide (LAE), lysergic acid ethyl-2-hydroxyethylamide (LEO), 2-oxo-LSD, trioxylated-LSD, and 13/14-hydroxy-LSD, should be identified. METHODS: Separation of LSD and its metabolites was achieved on a reversed phase chromatography column after turbulent-flow online extraction. For the identification and quantification, a triple-stage quadrupole LC-MS/MS instrument was used. RESULTS: The validation data showed slight matrix effects for LSD, iso-LSD, O-H-LSD, or nor-LSD. Mean intraday and interday accuracy and precision were 105%/4.81% and 105%/4.35% for LSD, 98.7%/5.75% and 99.4%/7.21% for iso-LSD, 106%/4.54% and 99.4%/7.21% for O-H-LSD, and 107%/5.82% and 102%/5.88% for nor-LSD, respectively.

The aims of this clinical trial were to evaluate ketamine's antidepressive effects in ECT as a primary anesthetic, determine ketamine's tolerability when compared with standard anesthesia, and determine if plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary for treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults meeting criteria for treatment-resistant depression undergoing index course ECT received either methohexital (1 to 2\u2009mg/kg) or ketamine (1 to 2\u2009mg/kg) anesthesia in this dual-arm double-blinded randomized clinical trial (NCT02752724). The primary outcome of this study is change in depression questionnaire scores before and after ECT. Seizure data, depression severity using self-reported and clinician-assessed questionnaires, cognitive scoring, and plasma BDNF concentrations were obtained before and after completion of ECT. RESULTS: There were no differences in seizure lengths, hemodynamics, or seizure stimuli between the ketamine (n=23;138 ECTs) and methohexital (n=27;159 ECTs) groups. Depression scores improved similarly after ECT in both groups. In the methohexital group, 15% of patients failed to achieve adequate seizures and were switched to ketamine and 26% were converted to bilateral ECT stimulus, whereas all ketamine patients achieved adequate seizures and only 4% required bilateral stimulus. Plasma BDNF increased after ECT only in the ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ketamine does not significantly improve depression when compared with methohexital as a single induction agent for ECT, increases serum BDNF and does not increase rates of post-ECT agitation.

Methods: We examined PM use and various measures of health status, quality of life, and self-reported mental health outcome measures obtained through a national on-line, cross-sectional survey of adults with a demographic composition representative of the US adult population by region, gender, age, and race (weighted N = 251,297,495) from November 2020\u2013March 2021. Results: General mental health and well-being were popular reasons for PM use (63.6%), although use for medically-diagnosed (31.8%) and self-diagnosed (19.0%) conditions was also common. PM users reported more depression and anxiety as reflected in higher GAD-7 and PHQ-9 scores. Factors predictive of PM use included being male [OR 1.54 95%CI 1.09\u20132.15] and having higher Charlson Comorbidity Index scores [OR 1.42; 95%CI 1.22\u20131.65].

Well documented in animal models, only limited research in humans has been reported. Findings to date are similar to results of animal studies; however, antagonists are typically administered before the learning experience. This may be problematic as memory failure could be secondary to inattention induced by the psychotomimetic effects of these drugs and/or alterations in sensory processing which can degrade the quality of the stimulus, thereby affecting the accuracy of recall. OBJECTIVE: The objective of the study is to compare the effects of ketamine vs placebo on recall for words when administered after stimulus presentation. METHODS: In this double-blind crossover study, 24 normal controls were given bolus injections of ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) or placebo. Immediately prior to infusion, subjects were administered a verbal memory test. Delayed recall was measured 45 min postinfusion. Mental status changes were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. RESULTS: Subjects experienced a significant increase in psychiatric symptoms that peaked at 20 min. Results indicate no differences between the drug and placebo conditions for the memory task. However, reminiscence (i.e., recall of previously unrecalled items with repeated testing) was significantly reduced following ketamine administration compared to placebo.

METHODS: We conducted growth mixture modeling to estimate latent classes of change in depression (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report, QIDS-SR) across six treatment visits in 298 patients with MDD treated with IV ketamine in an outpatient community clinic. Mean age was 40.36 and patients were primarily male (58.4\u00a0%).

RESULTS: Best-fit indices indicated three trajectory groups to optimally demonstrate non-linear, quadratic changes in depressive symptoms during ketamine treatment. Two groups had severe depression at baseline but diverged into a group of modest improvement over the treatment course (n\u00a0=\u00a078) and a group of patients with rapid improvement (n\u00a0=\u00a0103).

Serotonin releasers such as MDMA disrupt PPI and reduce startle habituation in rodents. These effects are prevented by pretreatment with selective serotonin uptake inhibitors, indicating that the effect of MDMA on startle plasticity is largely due to carrier-mediated release of serotonin from presynaptic terminals. In contrast, MDMA has been shown to increase PPI in humans. It is unclear, however, whether the MDMA-induced increase in PPI in humans is also dependent on carrier-mediated serotonin release and which postsynaptic receptors are involved. We investigated the effects of three different pretreatments on the MDMA-induced effects on PPI and habituation in humans. Pretreatments were: (1) the highly selective serotonin uptake inhibitor citalopram (40 mg IV) in 16 subjects, (2) the D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg IV) in 14 subjects, and (3) the 5-HT(2A/C) antagonist ketanserin (50 mg PO) in 14 subjects.

Therefore, the current study investigated whether gender moderated the relationship between ecstasy exposure and components of verbal memory after controlling for polydrug use and confounding variables. Method: Data were collected from 65 polydrug users with a wide range of ecstasy exposure (ages 18-35; 48 ecstasy and 17 marijuana users; 0-2310 ecstasy tablets). Participants completed a verbal learning and memory task, psychological questionnaires, and a drug use interview. Results: Increased past year ecstasy exposure predicted poorer short and long delayed free and cued recalls, retention, and recall discrimination. Male ecstasy users were more susceptible to dose-dependent deficits in retention than female users. Conclusion: Past year ecstasy consumption was associated with verbal memory retrieval, retention, and discrimination deficits in a dose-dependent manner in a sample of healthy young adult polydrug users. Male ecstasy users were at particular risk for deficits in retention following a long delay. Gender difference may be reflective of different patterns of polydrug use as well as increased hippocampal sensitivity.

Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects.

It is associated with great disability and worsened quality of life, increased number and intensity of physical symptoms, and lower survival. It is the main factor for the presence of suicidal ideation. Antidepressants show modest efficacy, and response requires several weeks. Ketamine has demonstrated a fast and robust antidepressant effect in subanesthetic doses. This effect may prove useful in patients with AC, MDD, and suicidal risk. METHOD: We report a case of a patient with advanced cervical cancer who presented with uncontrollable pain, MDD, and a suicide attempt. RESULT: A 39-year-old woman diagnosed with cervical cancer stage IVB presented to the Emergency Department after a suicide attempt by hanging. Upon evaluation by the palliative care psychiatrist, she reported intense pain, unresponsive to analgesics, and had a history of persistent suicidal ideation. Antidepressant treatment was started (sertraline 50mg/d) after a single dose of ketamine hydrochloride IV (0.5 mg/kg) was administered. Treatment response was measured using the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale before and after the intervention. The depressive symptoms decreased by 17% on day 1, 39% on day 3, and 72% on day 17. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This case report shows ketamine's efficacy as an augmentation agent alongside conventional antidepressant treatment in patients with AC.

Evidence suggests that memory is a neocortical neuronal network, excitation of which involves the hippocampus, with recall occurring by re-excitement of the same specific network. Excitement of the hippocampus by glutamate-NMDA receptors, leading to long-term potentiation (LTP), can be blocked by ketamine. Continuous block of LTP prevents new memory formation but does not affect previous memories. Opioid antagonists prevent loss of consciousness with ketamine but do not prevent the block of LTP.

Here we report how a set of acute parameters, namely emotional (depressive symptoms), cognitive (psychedelic experience), and physiological (salivary cortisol), recorded during an ayahuasca dosing session, modulated serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serum cortisol (SC), serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR). METHODS: Results were analyzed 2 days after the psychedelic intervention (ayahuasca) versus placebo in both patients with treatment-resistant depression and healthy volunteers. These measures were assessed as part of a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (n = 72). RESULTS: Results revealed that larger reductions of depressive symptoms during the dosing session significantly moderated higher levels of SC in patients. Whereas lesser changes in salivary cortisol levels during the ayahuasca intervention were related to higher BDNF levels in patients with a larger clinical response in the reduction in depressive symptoms. No moderator was found for patient's CAR, IL-6, and CRP responses to ayahuasca and for all biomarker responses to ayahuasca in healthy controls and in the placebo group. DISCUSSION: In summary, some specific emotional and physiological parameters during experimental ayahuasca session were revealed as critical moderators of the improvement of major depression biomarkers, mainly BDNF and SC two days after ayahuasca intake.

In the present study, 23 abstinent MDMA users and 19 non-MDMA controls underwent quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, first- and second-generation serotonin transporter (SERT) ligands previously validated in baboons for detecting MDMA-induced brain serotonin neurotoxicity. Global and regional distribution volumes (DVs) and two additional SERT-binding parameters (DV(spec) and DVR) were compared in the two subject populations using parametric statistical analyses. Data from PET studies revealed excellent correlations between the various binding parameters of [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, both in individual brain regions and individual subjects. Global SERT reductions were found in MDMA users with both PET ligands, using all three of the above-mentioned SERT-binding parameters. Preplanned comparisons in 15 regions of interest demonstrated reductions in selected cortical and subcortical structures. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested that SERT measures recover with time, and that loss of the SERT is directly associated with MDMA use intensity. These quantitative PET data, obtained using validated first- and second-generation SERT PET ligands, provide strong evidence of reduced SERT density in some recreational MDMA users.", "doi": "10.1038/sj.npp.1300736", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/15841106/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

Only about 30% of patients respond to a first-line antidepressant treatment, and around 30% of patients are classified as 'treatment-resistant' after failing to respond to multiple adequate trials. While most antidepressants target monoaminergic targets, ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist that has shown rapid antidepressant effects when delivered intravenously or intranasally. While there is evidence that ketamine exerts its effects via enhanced \u03b1-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) throughput, its mechanism for relieving depressive symptoms is largely unknown. This study acquired resting-state magnetoencephalography (MEG) recordings after both ketamine and placebo infusions and investigated functional connectivity using a multilayer amplitude-amplitude correlation technique spanning the canonical frequency bands. Twenty-four healthy volunteers (HVs) and 27 unmedicated participants with MDD took part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of 0.5 mg/kg IV ketamine.

Case Report A 23-year-old male was observed to suddenly stop talking. His ED GCS was 8 and had normal vital signs. While verbally unresponsive, he refused to open his eyes, demonstrated waxy flexibility of his arms, but the balance of his physical, neurological, and laboratory exams were normal. Strongly suspecting a catatonic state, they needed to rapidly confirm that diagnosis or begin evaluating him for potentially life-threatening non-psychiatric illnesses. Lacking other diagnostic modalities, they administered low-dose ketamine boluses. Ketamine 25 mg (1 mL) was diluted in 9 mL NS (2.5 mg/mL). Based on similar protocols, 1 mL of the solution (0.03 mg/Kg) was given intravenously every few minutes. After 12.5 mg ketamine, he was conscious and verbal. Subsequent history confirmed a prior episode requiring an extensive, non-productive medical evaluation. Psychiatry later confirmed the diagnosis. Why Should an Emergency Physician Be Aware of This? Patients with catatonia-like states pose a difficult diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. Multiple interventions have been used with varying success. Optimal interventions provide a rapid resolution (or demonstrate that a psychiatric cause is not likely), be safe, encompass few contraindications, and be familiar to the clinician. In our patient, subanesthetic doses of ketamine fulfilled these criteria and successfully resolved the condition.

Both the patient and all other individuals involved in the study will be blinded as to the treatment except Guillermo Alexander PhD who will be responsible for the randomization and Margaret Rose RN who will be responsible for preparing the infusion solution. The patient will then receive a complete neurological examination and will be asked to complete a short form McGill and Quality of life questionnaires (Attachment 1). Two weeks before treatment, 2 week and 3 months post treatment the following sensory and motor tests will be performed. Thermal Detection Thresholds: Cool detection thresholds, which are mediated via A fibers and warm detection thresholds, which are mediated by small unmyelinated C fibers, will be determined using the TSA\u2010II NeuroSensory Analyzer (Medoc Advanced Medical Systems U.S., Minneapolis, MN). The device consists of a computer controlled thermoelectric probe with a surface area of 9 cm2 that is attached using a velcro strap to the area of skin to be tested (thenar eminence and hypothenar eminence in the hands and the dorsal foot). For each trial the thermal stimulator starts at the thermo\u2010neutral baseline temperature of 32oC, and increases for warming thresholds, or decreases for cooling thresholds, linearly at a rate of 1oC per second, until the subject pushes a button that stops and records the temperature and returns the unit to baseline temperature. Three trials are averaged for cool and for warm threshold for each site tested. Thermal Pain: Thermal pain tolerance will be determined at the same sites and using the same method described above for thermal detection thresholds. The only difference is that for thermal pain trials, the subject will be instructed to push the control button (which immediately resets the stimulator back to baseline temperature) when the thermal stimulus (cold or hot) becomes painful. The TSA\u2010II hardware automatically resets if the temperature reaches \u201010oC (for cooling) or 50oC (for heating) and the control button has not been pushed. This temperature range has been determined to not cause damage to skin or underlying tissue. Dynamic Mechano\u2010allodynia: Dynamic mechano\u2010allodynia will be determined by stroking the skin three times within 5 seconds at a rate of 5 cm/sec with a 2.5 cm wide standard foam paintbrush. Allodynia severity will be measured on the subject's response using a numerical rating scale. The subject reports both the amount of pain on a 0\u201010 scale (0: no pain; 10: worst pain ever experienced) and the extent to which the sensation spread. Static Mechano\u2010allodynia and Temporal Summation: Static mechano\u2010allodynia and temporal summation will be determined by pin\u2010prick with a standard safety pin once every three seconds for a total of 5 times. The subject will be instructed to report the level of pain on a 0\u201010 scale (0: no pain; 10: worst pain ever experienced) and the extent to which the sensation spread after each repetition. The test will stop if the subject reports unacceptable pain at any point during the test. Cutaneous Temperature: Skin temperature will be measured by use of an infra\u2010red thermometer (Dermatemp Infrared Temperature Scanner, model DT\u20101001, Exergen Corp., Watertown, MA) PRE INFUSION: On the first day of treatment but prior to the start of the infusions, the patient will be weighed, undergo a neurologic exam, have vital signs evaluated and have an intravenous line inserted.

Deep pressure pain thresholds: Deep pressure pain thresholds will be determined with a pressure algometer (Wagner Instruments, Greenwi h, CT) which is a hand held device with a 1cm2 rub\u00acber tip capable of measuring applied pressures of 0\u20105 kg. The device is held at a 90o angle to the body surface being tested. The pressure is gradually increased by 1 kg/second until the subject reports that the stimulus is painful or a pressure of 4 kg/cm2 has been reached. In the upper extremity thresholds to pain will be determined at: 1)second costosternal joint; 2) acromioclavicular joint; 3) lateral epicondyle; 4) radial styloid; 5) ulnar styloid; 6) second metacarpal; 6) fifth metacarpal. In the lower extremity thresholds to pain will be determined at: 1) greater trochanter; 2) lateral femoral condyle; 3) tibial tubercle; 4) mid shin; 5) medial malleolus; 6) lateral malleolus; 7) first metatarsal; 8) fifth metatarsal. Quantification of Motor Function (finger tap): Finger tap rate will be determined using a computer program developed by our group. The subject is instructed to press the spacebar of a standard computer keyboard as fast as possible with the index finger of each hand respectively for 30 seconds. The program determines the rate and plots the results. A pregnancy test will be administered to all females of child bearing potential and blood will also be drawn for SMA\u201020, CBC w/ Differential and a full thyroid panel. All subjects will be asked to wear an activity watch until the treatment begins (two week). This watch (Attachment 2) will evaluate the subject's level of activity and at random programmed intervals records the subject's pain level for the two weeks prior to treatment. This is accomplished by sounding a tone at which time the subject is instructed to presses a key pad and enter a number from 0\u201010 (0 = no pain and 10 = unbearable pain). The patient will be asked to complete the short form McGill and Quality of life questionnaires weekly until the start of the infusions. On all ten treatment days, patients on both the ketamine and placebo groups are placed on the cardiac monitor for cardiac rhythm, blood pressure, pulse and oxygen saturation monitoring. In addition, Clonidine (0.1 mg, po) and Versed (4 mg, iv) will be administered. Clonidine has been shown, in animals, to potentiate the neuropathic pain\u2010relieving action of NMDA receptor blockers like ketamine while preventing their neurotoxic side effects. Versed at this dose, provides mild sedation and relieves anxiety. All patients will be infused intravenously with 100 ml of normal saline with or without ketamine for four hours (25 ml/hr) daily for 10 days. The maximum intravenous ketamine infusion dose for this study will be 0.35 mg/kg/hr, not to exceed 25 mg/hr (100 mg of ketamine over a 4 hour period). On the first day, the intravenous ketamine infusion will be set to 50% of the maximum rate. On the second day, the intravenous ketamine infusion will be increased to 75% of the maximum rate.

However, whether such non\u2010dissociative experiences are related to antidepressant responses following sub\u2010anesthetic infusions of the glutamate\u2010modulator ketamine has been minimally investigated using proper controls and sample\u2010sizes. Using 86 participants with treatment\u2010resistant unipolar or bipolar depression enrolled in double\u2010blind, placebo\u2010controlled crossover ketamine trials, we tested the hypothesis that self\u2010reported euphoria, fear or anxiety during ketamine\u2019s psychoactive period mediates antidepressant response. We predicted that greater euphoria and lower anxiety and fear would predict reduced depressive symptom\u2010severity one (D1) and seven (D7) days following infusion. Methods: We administered a standard adverse events (AE) questionnaire (scored from zero\u2010three) that included \u201ceuphoria,\u201d \u201cfearful,\u201d and \u201canxiety\u201d items measured immediately after 40\u2010minute infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and saline. Our primary outcome was the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We used drug*AE\u2010interactions from mixed models to test mediation hypotheses. Covariates included diagnosis and baseline MADRS. Results: We did not detect any drug*AE interactions associated with D1 MADRS\u2010scores. While greater anxiety was associated with higher D1 MADRS for ketamine and placebo, (p= 0.007), main effects of fear (p=0.062) and euphoria (p=0.059) were weaker.

This study evaluated the preclinical and clinical pharmacokinetics and metabolism of DMT in healthy subjects. METHODS: The physiochemical properties of DMT were determined using a series of in vitro experiments and its metabolic profile was assessed using monoamine oxidase (MAO) and cytochrome P450 (CYP) inhibitors in hepatocyte and mitochondrial fractions. Clinical pharmacokinetics results are from the phase I component of a phase I/IIa randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group, dose-escalation trial (NCT04673383). Healthy adults received single escalating doses of DMT fumarate (SPL026) via a two-phase intravenous (IV) infusion. Dosing regimens were calculated based on pharmacokinetic modelling and predictions with progression to each subsequent dose level contingent upon safety and tolerability. RESULTS: In vitro clearance of DMT was reduced through the inhibition of MAO-A, CYP2D6 and to a lesser extent CYP2C19. Determination of lipophilicity and plasma protein binding was low, indicating that a high proportion of DMT is available for distribution and metabolism, consistent with the very rapid clinical pharmacokinetics. Twenty-four healthy subjects received escalating doses of DMT administered as a 10-min infusion over the dose range of 9-21.5 mg (DMT freebase). DMT was rapidly cleared for all doses: mean elimination half-life was 9-12 min. All doses were safe and well tolerated and there was no relationship between peak DMT plasma concentrations and body mass index (BMI) or weight. CONCLUSION: This is the first study to determine, in detail, the full pharmacokinetics profile of DMT following a slow IV infusion in humans, confirming rapid attainment of peak plasma concentrations followed by rapid clearance.

The databases PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science were searched for studies published from inception to August 24, 2018, without any language restriction. Sixteen independent studies comprising 356 MDMA users and 311 controls were included. Of these, five studies investigated frontal and occipital N-acetylaspartate/creatine and myo-inositol/creatine ratios, three studies assessed basal ganglia blood flow and ten studies investigated serotonin transporter (SERT) density in various regions. We found significantly decreased SERT density in eight of 13 investigated regions. Meta-regression indicated a positive association with abstinence, but none with lifetime episodes of use. Therefore, other variables (such as doses taken per occasion) might be more important determinants. Positive associations between time of abstinence and SERT density might indicate that these alterations are reversible to some extent. Furthermore, there were no significant differences between user and control groups in terms of neurochemical ratios in the frontal and occipital lobes and blood flow in the basal ganglia. Overall, MDMA user groups showed heavy use patterns and study quality was poor.", "doi": "10.1016/j.neubiorev.2018.11.004", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30439373/", "secondary_title": "Neurosci Biobehav Rev"}

We investigated the relationship between the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine and hippocampal volume, a biomarker of antidepressant treatment outcome. We gave 16 medication-free, major depressive disorder (MDD) patients a single, sub-anesthetic dose infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, over 40 min). We assessed depression severity pre-treatment, and at 24 h post-treatment, with the Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Prior to treatment, patients underwent magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate their hippocampal volume: We obtained viable MRI data in 13 patients. Delta MADRS (post- minus pre-treatment) was significantly correlated with the pre-treatment volumes of the left hippocampus (r = 0.66; p = 0.01), but not the right hippocampus (r = 0.49; p = 0.09). The correlation between delta MADRS and the left hippocampus remained high (r > 0.6; p = 0.13), after controlling for several demographic and clinical variables, although the p value increased due to the reduced degree of freedom (df = 5). Ketamine exerts enhanced antidepressant effects in patients with a relatively smaller hippocampus, a patient population that has been repeatedly shown to be refractory to traditional antidepressants.", "doi": "10.1177/0269881114544776", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25122038/", "secondary_title": "J Psychopharmacol"}

More recently neuroimaging has been used to corroborate these deficits. The present study aimed to assess multitasking performance in ecstasy polydrug users, polydrug users and drug-naive individuals. It was predicted that ecstasy polydrug users would perform worse than non-users on the behavioural measure and this would be supported by differences in cortical blood oxygenation. METHOD: In the study, 20 ecstasy-polydrug users, 17 polydrug users and 19 drug-naive individuals took part. On day 1, drug use history was taken and questionnaire measures were completed. On day 2, participants completed a 20-min multitasking stressor while brain blood oxygenation was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: There were no significant differences between the three groups on the subscales of the multitasking stressor. In addition, there were no significant differences on self-report measures of perceived workload (NASA Task Load Index). In terms of mood, ecstasy users were significantly less calm and less relaxed compared with drug-naive controls. There were also significant differences at three voxels on the fNIRS, indicating decreased blood oxygenation in ecstasy users compared with drug-naive controls at voxel 2 (left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), voxel 14 and voxel 16 (right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), and compared with polydrug controls at V14. CONCLUSIONS: The results of the present study provide support for changes in brain activation during performance of demanding tasks in ecstasy polydrug users, which could be related to cerebral vasoconstriction.", "doi": "10.1017/S0033291714001500", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25066866/", "secondary_title": "Psychological medicine"}

Limited data suggest that psilocybin\u2019s effects may be diminished by serotonergic antidepressants acutely and even after a medication washout period. Aims: To learn the extent to which antidepressants may diminish the effects of psilocybin-containing mushrooms both concurrently and after discontinuation of antidepressants. Methods: Online retrospective survey of individuals with use of psilocybin mushrooms (1) with an antidepressant and/or (2) within 2 years of discontinuing an antidepressant. Participants who took mushrooms with an antidepressant and either took the same dose pre-antidepressant or took the same dose with other people not on antidepressant reported the strength of drug effects relative to their expectation. Participants who took mushrooms following discontinuation of an antidepressant also reported the presence of weakened effects. Results: In reports (n = 611) of taking mushrooms with an antidepressant, probabilities [95% CI] of weaker than expected drug effects were 0.47 [0.41\u20130.54] (selective serotonergic reuptake inhibitors, SSRIs), 0.55 [0.44\u20130.67] (serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, SNRIs) and 0.29 [0.2\u20130.39] (bupropion). Following SSRI/SNRI discontinuation (n = 1,542 reports), the probability of reduced drug effects was not significantly different from the earliest post-discontinuation timepoint (within 1 week) until 3\u20136 months, probability = 0.3 [0.20\u20130.46], p = 0.001. A sensitivity analysis found that removing responses involving fluoxetine, which has an especially long half-life, did not significantly alter this result. Conclusions: SSRI/SNRIs appear to weaken psilocybin drug effects relative to a non-serotonergic antidepressant. This dampening effect may last as long as 3 months following antidepressant discontinuation.", "doi": "10.1177/02698811231179910", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/37291890/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Psychopharmacology"}
