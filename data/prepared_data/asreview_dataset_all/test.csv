"8320","1","Dose-response study of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans. II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^
BACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate ""nonblind,"" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. ""Loss of control,"" associated with a brief, but overwhelming ""rush,"" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans. They also may be used to compare the effects of other agents affecting relevant brain receptors in volunteer and psychiatric populations."
"1620","0","Nitrous oxide for TRD: preliminary findings.^
Background: Recently, NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., ketamine) have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) patients. Because nitrous oxide, an inhalational general anesthetic, is also an NMDA receptor antagonist, we hypothesized that nitrous oxide may be a rapidly acting treatment for TRD. Methods: Twenty TRD patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo‐controlled crossover trial; each received a 1‐hour inhalation of up to 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen or 50% nitrogen/50% oxygen (placebo control) in random order. Primary endpoint was change on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS‐21) 24 hours post‐treatment. Results: Mean duration of nitrous oxide treatment was 55.6 ± 2.5 (SD) minutes. In two patients nitrous oxide treatment was interrupted (subsequently resumed) and in three discontinued. Depressive symptoms improved significantly at 2 hours and 24 hours after receiving nitrous oxide compared to placebo (mean change HDRS‐21 score at 2 hours: ‐4.8 points, 95% CI ‐1.8 to ‐ 7.8 points, p= 0.002; at 24 hours: ‐5.5 points, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐8.5 points, p<0.001; comparison between nitrous oxide and placebo: p<0.001). Four patients (20%) had treatment response (≥50% HDRS reduction) and three patients (15%) remitted (HRDS ≤ 7 points) after nitrous oxide compared to one patient (5%) and none after placebo (odds ratio [OR] for response 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 ‐ 35.79; OR for remission 3.0, 95% CI 0.31 ‐ 28.8). All adverse events were brief and mild to moderate severity. Conclusions: This proof‐of‐concept trial demonstrated that nitrous oxide has rapid and marked antidepressant effects in patients with treatment‐resistant depression."

The aim of this study was to compare the effects of constant rate infusions (CRI) of fentanyl alone or combined with lidocaine and ketamine (FLK), on physiological parameters, isoflurane requirements and the number of postoperative analgesic rescues in dogs undergoing unilateral mastectomy. Twenty‐two dogs were premedicated with acepromazine 0.02 mg/kg and morphine 0.5 mg/kg and anesthetized with propofol and isoflurane. Dogs were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups: Fentanyl group (fentanyl 5 µg/kg loading dose [LD] and 9 µg/kg/h CRI; n = 11); FLK group (fentanyl [same doses]; lidocaine 2 mg/kg LD and 3 mg/kg/h CRI; ketamine 1.0 mg/kg LD and 0.6 mg/kg/h CRI; = 11). Intraoperative evaluations were performed before the start of surgery and administration of the treatments (T0); three minutes after the LD (T1); during incision and tissue divulsion (T2); during closure of the surgical wound (T3). Meloxicam (0.1 mg/kg) was administered at T3. Blood samples were collected for determination of plasma concentrations of fentanyl, lidocaine and ketamine. Pain scores and the number of postoperative analgesic rescues with morphine (0.5 mg/kg) were evaluated for 24 hours postoperatively using the short form of the Glasgow Composite Measure Pain Scale. Compared to T0, significant decreases in heart rate (from 84 ± 28 to 53 ± 16 bpm in the Fentanyl group and from 93 ± 16 to 63 ± 15 bpm in FLK) and mean arterial pressure (from 61 ± 5 to 49 ± 10 mmHg in Fentanyl and from 59 ± 3 to 38 ± 6 mmHg in FLK) were observed at T1. Arterial hypotension was transient, with normalization of values at T2 and T3. The expired fraction of isoflurane did not differ significantly between the groups. Plasma concentrations of fentanyl, lidocaine and ketamine remained within the therapeutic range. Postoperatively, the number of dogs requiring analgesic rescue was significantly lower in the FLK (0/11, 0%) than in the Fentanyl group (5/11, 45%). In dogs administered morphine and meloxicam as part of the anesthesia protocol, an intraoperative CRI of FLK abolished the requirement for postoperative analgesic rescue for 24 hours in dogs undergoing mastectomy."
"5314","1","Amphetamine analogs methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) differentially affect speech.^
RATIONALE: Most reports of the effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on speech have been anecdotal. OBJECTIVES: The current study used a within-participant design to assess the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA on speech. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven recreational users of amphetamines completed this inpatient, within-participant, double-blind study, during which they received placebo, methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), and MDMA (100 mg) on separate days. Following drug administration, study participants described movies viewed the previous evening and completed mood scales. RESULTS: Methamphetamine increased quantity of speech, fluency, and self-ratings of talkativeness and alertness, while it decreased the average duration of nonjuncture unfilled pauses. MDMA decreased fluency and increased self-ratings of inability to concentrate. To determine if methamphetamine- and MDMA-related effects were perceptible, undergraduates listened to the participants' movie descriptions and rated their coherence and the speaker's mood. Following methamphetamine, descriptions were judged to be more coherent and focused than they were following MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine improved verbal fluency and MDMA adversely affected fluency. This pattern of effects is consistent with the effects of these drugs on functioning in other cognitive domains. In general, methamphetamine effects on speech were inconsistent with effects popularly attributed to this drug, while MDMA-related effects were in agreement with some anecdotal reports and discordant with others."
"8628","0","Suicide and suicide risk.^
Although recent years have seen large decreases in the overall global rate of suicide fatalities, this trend is not reflected everywhere. Suicide and suicidal behaviour continue to present key challenges for public policy and health services, with increasing suicide deaths in some countries such as the USA. The development of suicide risk is complex, involving contributions from biological (including genetics), psychological (such as certain personality traits), clinical (such as comorbid psychiatric illness), social and environmental factors. The involvement of multiple risk factors in conveying risk of suicide means that determining an individual's risk of suicide is challenging. Improving risk assessment, for example, by using computer testing and genetic screening, is an area of ongoing research. Prevention is key to reduce the number of suicide deaths and prevention efforts include universal, selective and indicated interventions, although these interventions are often delivered in combination. These interventions, combined with psychological (such as cognitive behavioural therapy, caring contacts and safety planning) and pharmacological treatments (for example, clozapine and ketamine) along with coordinated social and public health initiatives, should continue to improve the management of individuals who are suicidal and decrease suicide-associated morbidity."
"6081","1","Ketamine: its Effects on Suicidal Ideations and Inpatient Hospital Length of Stay.^
Patients who agree to participate in this study will be enrolled within 24 hours of being admitted to the UMMC inpatient psychiatric service with suicidal ideations. After a member of the study team ensures that the patient understands the risks and benefits of participating versus not participating, the patient will be assigned, by chance, to one of the following groups: ‐ Group A: receives ketamine intravenous (IV) infusion over 45 minutes ‐ Group B: receives saline (salt solution) over 45 minutes The infusion will be administered in either the Post‐Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or Short Stay Procedure Area (SSPA). After receiving the infusion, the patient will be monitored for an additional 30 minutes by medical personnel in either the PACU or SSPA. This study will be a randomized, double blind cohort study, so neither the patient nor the study doctor will know which infusion is being administered. While receiving the infusion, the patient's vital signs (including heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature) will be monitored on an anesthesia paper chart. After the patient is discharged from the hospital, the treatment team will analyze the patient's medical record and compare the length of hospital stay between the control and treatment groups. The only information about the patient's hospital stay that will be analyzed will be the length of hospital stay. If a patient is a woman of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be performed after you agree to enroll in the study. The cost of this test will be covered by the University of Mississippi Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry. If you are found to be pregnant, you will not be able to participate in the study. Patients admitted after suicidal attempt may be enrolled in the study. Those who attempted suicide by medication overdose may participate in the study, but must be cleared by a medical toxicology specialist prior to enrollment. Due to cardiovascular adverse effects of ketamine, all participants will receive a 12‐lead EKG to screen for cardiac arrhythmias. Any rhythm other than sinus rhythm will result in exclusion from the study. The patient's length of hospital stay will be recorded. Patients will be called at three and six months post‐discharge to assess for any adverse events or medication reactions. Readmission rates will be assessed at six months post‐discharge."
"1242","0","Pharmacological interventions targeting anhedonia in patients with major depressive disorder: A systematic review.^
Anhedonia is defined as a diminished ability to experience interest or pleasure, and is a critical psychopathological dimension of major depressive disorder (MDD). The purpose of the current systematic review is to evaluate the therapeutic efficacy of pharmacological treatments on measures of anhedonia in adults with MDD. Electronic databases Cochrane Library (CENTRAL), Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Google Scholar were searched from inception to June 1, 2018 for longitudinal studies utilizing pharmacotherapy for the treatment of anhedonia in patients with MDD. A total of 17 eligible studies were identified (i.e., evaluated the effects of pharmacotherapy on a measure of anhedonia). Among the identified studies, the efficacy of 14 different pharmacotherapies on measures of anhedonia were evaluated, including melatonergic agents (i.e. agomelatine), monoaminergic agents (i.e. moclobemide, clomipramine, bupropion, venlafaxine, fluoxetine, amitifadine and levomilnacipran, escitalopram, and sertraline), glutamatergic agents (i.e., ketamine and riluzole), stimulants (i.e., methylphenidate), and psychedelics (i.e., psilocybin). Based on the available evidence, most antidepressants demonstrated beneficial effects on measures of anhedonia as well as the other depressive symptoms. Only escitalopram/riluzole combination treatment was ineffective in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Continued research is warranted to further support the efficacy of mechanistically-distinct antidepressants in treating symptoms of anhedonia in MDD. Future research should also aim to parse out the heterogeneous effects of different pharmacotherapies on anhedonic symptoms."
"6419","1","Psychedelic therapy for smoking cessation: Qualitative analysis of participant accounts.^
BACKGROUND: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications."
"9390","0","Ketamine treatment for depression: a review.^
This manuscript reviews the clinical evidence regarding single-dose intravenous (IV) administration of the novel glutamatergic modulator racemic (R,S)-ketamine (hereafter referred to as ketamine) as well as its S-enantiomer, intranasal esketamine, for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD). Initial studies found that a single subanesthetic-dose IV ketamine infusion rapidly (within one day) improved depressive symptoms in individuals with MDD and bipolar depression, with antidepressant effects lasting three to seven days. In 2019, esketamine received FDA approval as an adjunctive treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults. Esketamine was approved under a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy (REMS) that requires administration under medical supervision. Both ketamine and esketamine are currently viable treatment options for TRD that offer the possibility of rapid symptom improvement. The manuscript also reviews ketamine’s use in other psychiatric diagnoses—including suicidality, obsessive–compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, substance abuse, and social anxiety disorder—and its potential adverse effects. Despite limited data, side effects for antidepressant-dose ketamine—including dissociative symptoms, hypertension, and confusion/agitation—appear to be tolerable and limited to around the time of treatment. Relatively little is known about ketamine’s longer-term effects, including increased risks of abuse and/or dependence. Attempts to prolong ketamine’s effects with combined therapy or a repeat-dose strategy are also reviewed, as are current guidelines for its clinical use. In addition to presenting a novel and valuable treatment option, studying ketamine also has the potential to transform our understanding of the mechanisms underlying mood disorders and the development of novel therapeutics."
"84","1","Prevalence of amphetamine-type stimulants use in Iran: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^
Background and objective: The use of Amphetamine-Type Stimulants (ATS) is a major health concern after cannabis in the world. The study aimed to conduct a systematic review of the published articles on the prevalence of methamphetamine, ecstasy, and non-prescribed methylphenidate (Ritalin) use in Iran and to perform a meta-analysis on this subject. Methods: PubMed, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, and national Persian databases including SID, Magiran, and IranDoc were searched for articles published until July 31, 2019. The pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence and 95% confidence intervals of ATS use were calculated. Results: Fifty-five articles were included in the meta-analysis. The pooled lifetime and 12-month prevalence of ATS use was 5.4% (95% CI: 4.9%-6.0%) and 2.4% (95% CI: 1.9%-2.9%), respectively. The pooled lifetime prevalence of methamphetamine, ecstasy and non-prescribed methylphenidate (Ritalin) use was 6.7% (95% CI: 4.9%-8.6%), 5.9% (95% CI: 4.9%-6.8%) and 16.4% (95% CI: 11.6%-21.2%), respectively. Conclusion: In Iran, lifetime ATS use is of intermediate prevalence. However, it is higher than that of other countries. The findings of this review highlight the need for more attention to ATS use in young men in the west and northwest of Iran."
"8433","1","Development and Evaluation of a Therapist Training Program for Psilocybin Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression in Clinical Research.^
Introduction: Psychological support throughout psilocybin therapy is mandated by regulators as an essential part of ensuring participants' physical and psychological safety. There is an increased need for specially trained therapists who can provide high-quality care to participants in clinical studies. This paper describes the development and practical implementation of a therapist training program of psychological support within a current phase IIb international, multicenter, randomized controlled study of psilocybin therapy for people experiencing treatment-resistant depression. Description of Training Program: This new and manualized approach, based on current evidence-based psychotherapeutic approaches, was developed in partnership with different mental health researchers, practitioners, and experts; and has been approved by the FDA. Training consists of four components: an online learning platform; in-person training; applied clinical training; and ongoing individual mentoring and participation in webinars.This paper provides a brief overview of the method of support, the rationale and methodology of the training program, and describes each stage of training. The design and implementation of fidelity procedures are also outlined. Lessons Learned: As part of the phase IIb study of psilocybin therapy for treatment-resistant depression, 65 health care professionals have been fully trained as therapists and assisting therapists, across the US, Canada and Europe. Therapists provided informal feedback on the training program. Feedback indicates that the didactic and experiential interactive learning, delivered through a combination of online and in-person teaching, helped therapists build conceptual understanding and skill development in the therapeutic approach. Clinical training and engagement in participant care, under the guidance of experienced therapists, were considered the most beneficial and challenging aspects of the training. Conclusions: Clinical training for therapists is essential for ensuring consistently high-quality psilocybin therapy. Development of a rigorous, effective and scalable training methodology has been possible through a process of early, active and ongoing collaborations between mental health experts. To maximize impact and meet phase III and post-approval need, enhanced online learning and establishing pathways for clinical training are identified as critical points for quality assurance. This will require close public, academic and industry collaboration."
"1135","1","Subacute effects of a single dose of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans: An open-label preliminary investigation.^
RATIONALE: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic that has gained prominent attention recently as a potential therapeutic for neuropsychiatric disorders including Major Depressive Disorder. Pre-clinical and initial studies in humans suggest that serotonin 2A receptor agonists, including serotonergic psychedelics, have anti-inflammatory effects. This may contribute to its therapeutic effects as previous studies indicate a link between neuropsychiatric disorders and inflammatory processes. However, the effect of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation has not been evaluated in humans. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on peripheral biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 16 healthy participants before and one day after the administration of a single oral dose of psilocybin (mean dose: 0.22 mg/kg) and subsequently analyzed for concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Change in inflammatory markers was evaluated using a paired t-test where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significant changes in any of the above biomarkers of inflammation (all Cohen's d ≤ 0.31; all p ≥ 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support that a single dose of psilocybin reduces biomarkers of inflammation in healthy individuals one day after administration. Nevertheless, we suggest that future studies consider additional markers of inflammation, including markers of neuroinflammation, and evaluate potential anti-inflammatory effects of psilocybin therapy in clinical cohorts where more prominent effects may be observable."

"7398","1","A simplified 6-Item clinician administered dissociative symptom scale (CADSS-6) for monitoring dissociative effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions.^
BACKGROUND: Dissociation is a treatment-emergent adverse event commonly associated with IV ketamine, often measured using the 23-item Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The objective of this study was to develop a short form version of the CADSS for easier clinical use. METHODS: Retrospective data of 260 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) receiving IV ketamine were randomly divided into two datasets. The first dataset (n = 130) was leveraged to develop a brief 6-item version of the CADSS (CADSS-6) based on items most sensitive to ketamine-induced dissociation. The CADSS-6 questions were then applied to the second dataset (n = 130) and the Spearman's correlation between the full-length CADSS and the CADSS-6 were assessed. RESULTS: The CADSS-6 was developed from questions 1, 2, 6, 7, 15, and 22 from the full length CADSS. There was a strong significant correlation between the CADSS-6 total score and the CADSS total score at infusions 1 (rs(106) = 0.92, p < 0.001), 2 (rs(100) = 0.91, p < 0.001), 3(rs(99) = 0.95, p < 0.001) and 4 (rs(102) = 0.94, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The CADSS-6 was developed using a retrospective data; therefore, the scale remains unvalidated in this population. CONCLUSIONS: The CADSS-6 presented herein was sensitive to dissociation experienced by patients receiving IV ketamine. Overall, the CADSS-6 was strongly correlated at each infusion with the full-length CADSS. While future studies should look to validate the CADSS-6 in a TRD sample, this scale offers clinicians a brief assessment that can be used to characterize symptoms of dissociation."

There is an increased societal trend to engage in microdosing, in which small sub-hallucinogenic amounts of psychedelics are consumed on a regular basis. Following subjective reports that microdosing enhances the experience of nature and art, in the present study we set out to study the effects of psilocybin microdosing on feelings of awe and art perception. In this preregistered combined field- and lab-based study, participants took part in a microdosing workshop after which they volunteered to self-administer a psilocybin microdose or a placebo for three consecutive weeks, while the condition was kept blind to the participants and researchers. Following a 2-week break, the condition assignment was reversed. During each block, participants visited the lab twice to measure the effects of psilocybin microdosing vs. placebo. We used standardized measures of awe, in which participants reported their experiences in response to short videos or when viewing abstract artworks from different painters. Our confirmatory analyses showed that participants felt more awe in response to videos representing funny animals and moving objects in the microdosing compared to the placebo condition. However, about two-third of our participants were breaking blind to their experimental condition. Our exploratory findings suggest that expectancy-effects may be a driving factor underlying the subjective benefits of microdosing."
"9191","0","Culturally informed research design issues in a study for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.^
Recent research suggests that psychedelic drugs can be powerful agents of change when utilized in conjunction with psychotherapy. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy has been studied as a means of helping people overcome posttraumatic stress disorder, believed to work by reducing fear of traumatic memories and increasing feelings of trust and compassion toward others, without inhibiting access to difficult emotions. However,research studies for psychedelic psychotherapies have largely excluded people of color, leaving important questions unaddressed for these populations. At the University of Connecticut, we participated as a study site in a MAPS-sponsored, FDA-reviewed Phase 2 open-label multi site study, with a focus on providing culturally informed care to people of color. We discuss the development of a study site focused on the ethnic minority trauma experience,including assessment of racial trauma, design of informed consent documents to improve understanding and acceptability to people of color, diversification of the treatment team, ongoing training for team members, validation of participant experiences of racial oppression at a cultural and individual level, examination of the setting and music used during sessions for cultural congruence, training for the independent rater pool, community outreach, and institutional resistance. We also discuss next steps in ensuring that access to culturally informed care is prioritized as MDMA and other psychedelics move into late phase trials, including the importance of diverse sites and training focused on therapy providers of color.

"4643","1","MDMA intoxication and verbal memory performance: a placebo-controlled pharmaco-MRI study.^
The aim of the present study was to identify the neural substrate underlying memory impairment due to a single dose of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) by means of pharmaco-MRI. Based on previous behavioral results it was hypothesized that this deficit could be attributed to a specific influence of MDMA on encoding. Fourteen Ecstasy users participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with two treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg) and placebo. Memory performance was tested by means of a word learning task including two words lists, one addressing reading processes (control task, CWL) and a second (experimental task, EWL) addressing encoding and reading processes. Behavioral data showed that under the influence of MDMA, EWL performance was worse than placebo. Imaging data showed that Encoding was situated mainly in (pre)frontal, temporal and parietal areas. MDMA by Encoding interaction was situated in three areas: the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the right fusiform gyrus (BA19), and the left cuneus (BA18). Behavioral and functional data only correlated in BA10. It appeared that EWL performance caused BOLD signal change in BA10 during placebo treatment but not during MDMA intoxication. It is concluded that MDMA influences middle frontal gyrus processes resulting in impoverished memory encoding."
"1586","0","The effects of perceived quality on the behavioural economics of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy purchases.^
Previous research has indicated that non-dependent polydrug users are willing to pay more money to buy good quality drugs as their income increased. This study sought to examine whether altering the perceived quality of controlled drugs would affect drug purchases if the monetary price remained fixed. A random sample of 80 polydrug users were recruited. All participants were administered an anonymous questionnaire consisting of the Drug Abuse Screening Test for Adolescents (DAST-A), the Severity of Dependence Scale for cannabis (SDS), the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and questions about their drug use. Participants then completed a simulation of controlled drug purchases where the price of alcohol, amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine, and ecstasy remained the same but their perceived quality changed (i.e. unit price increased as the perceived quality decreased). The demand for alcohol was quality inelastic and alcohol quality had no effects on the purchase of any other controlled drug. Demand for cannabis was quality elastic and alcohol substituted for cannabis as its unit price increased. Demand for cocaine was quality elastic and alcohol, cannabis, and ecstasy substituted for cocaine as its unit price increased. Demand for ecstasy was quality elastic and alcohol and cocaine both substituted for ecstasy as its unit price increased. These results suggest that perceived quality influences the demand for controlled drugs and that monitoring the perceived quality of controlled drugs may provide a warning of potential public health problems in the near future."

Background: Delirium is common in the setting of infection with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. Anecdotal evidence and case reports suggest that patients with delirium in the setting of Coronavirus 2019 (COVID-19) may exhibit specific features, including increased tone, abulia, and alogia. Objective: To determine whether differences exist in sociodemographic and medical characteristics, physical examination findings, and medication use in delirious patients with and without COVID-19 infection referred for psychiatric consultation. Methods: We undertook an exploratory, retrospective chart review of 486 patients seen by the psychiatry consultation service at a tertiary care hospital from March 10 to May 15, 2020. Delirious patients were diagnosed via clinical examination by a psychiatric consultant, and these patients were stratified by COVID-19 infection status. The strata were described and compared using bivariate analyses across sociodemographic, historical, objective, and treatment-related variables. Results: A total of 109 patients were diagnosed with delirium during the study period. Thirty-six were COVID-19+. Median age was 63 years and did not differ between groups. COVID-19+ patients with delirium were more likely to present from nursing facilities (39% vs 11%; Fisher's exact test; P = 0.001) and have a history of schizophrenia (11% vs 0%; Fisher's exact test; P = 0.011). Myoclonus (28% vs 4%; P = 0.002), hypertonia (36% vs 10%; P = 0.003), withdrawal (36% vs 15%; P = 0.011), akinesia (19% vs 6%; P = 0.034), abulia (19% vs 3%; P = 0.004), and alogia (25% vs 8%; P = 0.012) were more common in COVID-19+ patients. COVID-19+ delirious patients were significantly more likely to have received ketamine (28% vs 7%; P = 0.006), alpha-adrenergic agents besides dexmedetomidine (36% vs 14%; P = 0.014), and enteral antipsychotics (92% vs 66%; P = 0.007) at some point. Conclusions: Patients with COVID-19 delirium referred for psychiatric consultation are more likely to reside in nursing facilities and have a history of schizophrenia than delirious patients without COVID-19. Patients with delirium in the setting of COVID-19 may exhibit features consistent with akinetic mutism. Psychiatrists must assess for such features, as they may influence management choices and the risk of side effects with agents commonly used in the setting of delirium."
"4215","0","Psilocybin in medicine and psychotherapy - an overview.^
Classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were intensively researched in the context of substance-assisted psychotherapy in the 1950s and 60s and were evaluated as promising for a broad spectrum of mental disorders. However, due to government restrictions, scientific research into the therapeutic application of these substances came to an early halt. After a nearly 50-year hiatus, psychedelic research has experienced a resurgence with a growing number of controlled clinical trials conducted according to current methodological standards. Results of modern clinical trials suggest the safety and efficacy of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin (along with LSD and ayahuasca) for various mental disorders, with the most advanced data on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depression. While the results of modern clinical trials are promising, further studies with larger numbers of cases over a longer observation period are needed, as well as comparisons with conventional antidepressant treatments. These will be essential in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment approach and to achieve regulatory approval. In addition, the biological and psychotherapeutic mechanisms mediating the psychedelic and possibly antidepressant effects are only partially understood. This review presents the potential applications and treatment context of psilocybinassisted psychotherapy for depression."
"1392","0","The effect of a ketamine constant rate infusion on cardiovascular variables in sheep anesthetized at the minimum alveolar concentration of sevoflurane that blunts adrenergic responses.^
OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effect of a constant rate infusion of ketamine on cardiac index (CI) in sheep, as estimated using noninvasive cardiac output (NICO) monitoring by partial carbon dioxide rebreathing, when anesthetized with sevoflurane at the previously determined minimum alveolar concentration that blunts adrenergic responses (MAC(BAR)). ANIMALS 12 healthy Dorset-crossbred adult sheep. PROCEDURES Sheep were anesthetized 2 times in a balanced placebo-controlled crossover design. Anesthesia was induced with sevoflurane delivered via a tight-fitting face mask and maintained at MACBAR. Following induction, sheep received either ketamine (1.5 mg/kg IV, followed by a constant rate infusion of 1.5 mg/kg/h) or an equivalent volume of saline (0.9% NaCl) solution (placebo). After an 8-day washout period, each sheep received the alternate treatment. NICO measurements were performed in triplicate 20 minutes after treatment administration and were converted to CI. Blood samples were collected prior to the start of NICO measurements for analysis of ketamine plasma concentrations. The paired t test was used to compare CI values between groups and the ketamine plasma concentrations with those achieved during the previous study. RESULTS Mean +/- SD CI of the ketamine and placebo treatments were 2.69 +/- 0.65 and 2.57 +/- 0.53 L/min/m(2), respectively. No significant difference was found between the 2 treatments. Mean ketamine plasma concentration achieved prior to the NICO measurement was 1.37 +/- 0.58 mu g/mL, with no significant difference observed between the current and prior study."
"1699","0","Effect of Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol on frontostriatal resting state functional connectivity and subjective euphoric response in healthy young adults.^
BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined how Δ9-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main psychoactive component of cannabis, impacts brain reward circuitry in humans. In this study, we examined if an acute dose of THC altered resting state functional connectivity between the striatum and prefrontal cortex among healthy young adults with limited cannabis use. METHODS: Participants received THC (n = 24) or placebo (n = 22) in a double-blind, randomized, between-subject design. Participants completed self-report measures of euphoria and drug-liking throughout the visit. Approximately 120 min after drug administration, participants completed an 8-min resting state functional MRI (rs-fMRI) scan. We utilized seed-based connectivity of the striatum (bilateral putamen, caudate, and NAcc seeds) to the frontal cortex. RESULTS: Individuals who received THC demonstrated greater rs-fMRI connectivity between the right NAcc and regions of the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) (p-values<0.05, corrected) and higher subjective euphoria ratings (p = .03) compared to compared to individuals who received placebo. Higher ratings of euphoria were related to greater right NAcc-dorsal mPFC (dmPFC) connectivity for the THC group (p=.03), but not for the placebo group (p=.98). CONCLUSIONS: This is one of the first studies to examine rs-fMRI connectivity in healthy young non-users after THC administration. We found individuals receiving THC show greater rs-fMRI connectivity between the NAcc and mPFC, regions implicated in reward, compared to individuals receiving placebo. In addition, individuals receiving THC reported higher subjective euphoria ratings, which were positively associated with NAcc-dmPFC connectivity. Overall, our findings suggest THC may produce subjective and neural reward responses that contribute to the rewarding, reinforcing properties of cannabis."

Repeated doses of the popular recreational drug methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') are known to produce neurotoxic effects on brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons but it is widely believed that typical single oral doses of MDMA are free of neurotoxic risk. Experimental and therapeutic trials with MDMA in humans are underway. The mechanisms by which MDMA produces neurotoxic effects are not understood but drug metabolites have been implicated. The aim of the present study was to assess the neurotoxic potential of a range of clinically relevant single oral doses of MDMA in a non-human primate species that metabolizes MDMA in a manner similar to humans, the squirrel monkey. A secondary objective was to explore the relationship between plasma MDMA and metabolite concentrations and lasting serotonergic deficits. Single oral doses of MDMA produced lasting dose-related serotonergic neurochemical deficits in the brains of squirrel monkeys. Notably, even the lowest dose of MDMA tested (5.7 mg/kg, estimated to be equivalent to 1.6 mg/kg in humans) produced significant effects in some brain regions. Plasma levels of MDMA engendered by neurotoxic doses of MDMA were on the order of those found in humans. Serotonergic neurochemical markers were inversely correlated with plasma concentrations of MDMA, but not with those of its major metabolites, 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine. These results suggest that single oral doses of MDMA in the range of those used by humans pose a neurotoxic risk and implicate the parent compound (MDMA), rather than one of its metabolites, in MDMA-induced 5-HT neural injury."
"6183","1","Music as an Intervention to Improve Hemodynamic Tolerability of Ketamine in Depression.^
Depression is the first cause of disability worldwide, and approximately 1 in 3 patients will fail to respond to current treatments. Intravenous (IV) low‐dose ketamine has remarkable efficacy in even the most treatment‐resistant depression (here defined as failure to at least two adequate trials of Level 1‐evidence psychiatric medications), inducing remission in 25‐50%. Over 100 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) show that music can mitigate hemodynamic and psychological stress caused by even highly invasive medical procedures. Though never studied, music may similarly improve ketamine tolerability. In this randomized, single‐blind (assessors will not know whether participants receive music or not) single‐center trial, 20 participants with TRD will receive 1) curated music or 2) no music during their course of 6 IV ketamine treatments (0.50mg/kg bodyweight) over 4 weeks. The primary aim is to compare changes in systolic blood pressure from the beginning to the end (40 minutes, peak plasma concentration) of each infusion between groups."
"6358","1","Two cases of delayed-onset suicidal ideation, dysphoria and anxiety after ketamine infusion in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and a history of major depressive disorder.^
Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that is Food and Drug Administration-approved in the United States for anesthesia due to its sedative effects with low risk of severe respiratory depression. Subanesthetic dose intravenous ketamine has rapidly acting antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression. We recently reported an open-label trial of ketamine in 10 subjects with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, seven of whom had active comorbid depression. Although ketamine had no sustained anti-obsessive effect, four of the seven subjects with comorbid depression experienced an acute antidepressant effect. However, we unexpectedly observed delayed-onset dysphoria, worsening anxiety and suicidal thinking in two of the three subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder and extensive psychiatric comorbidity but minimal depressive symptoms at the start of infusion. The implications of these adverse neuropsychiatric effects in two patients with similar psychiatric comorbidity are discussed. We conclude that there remains insufficient data on therapeutic ketamine in the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders to promote its off-label use in a non-research milieu."
"5446","1","A proof-of-concept investigation into ketamine as a pharmacological treatment for alcohol dependence: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Worldwide, alcohol abuse is a burgeoning problem. Abstinence is key to allow recovery of physical and mental health as well as quality of life, but treatment for alcohol dependence is associated with high relapse rates. Preliminary data have suggested that a combined repeated ketamine and psychological therapy programme may be effective in reducing relapse in severe alcohol use disorder. This non-commercial proof-of-concept trial is aimed at making a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of this combined treatment in this patient group. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial taking place in two sites in the UK: the South West of England and London. Ninety-six recently detoxified alcoholics, with comorbid depressive symptoms, will be randomised to one of four treatment arms. Patients will receive either three sessions of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes) or placebo (50 ml saline 0.9% IV over 40 minutes) plus either seven sessions of manualised psychological therapy or an alcohol education control. Patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months on a range of psychological and biological variables. The primary endpoints are (1) relapse rates at 6 months and (2) percentage days abstinent at 6 months. Secondary endpoints include 3 and 6 month percentage days abstinence, tolerability (indicated by dropout), adverse events, depressive symptoms, craving and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information on a new combined psychological and pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. The findings would have broad application given the worldwide prevalence of alcoholism and its associated medical, psychological and social problems.

"6015","1","Interaction Between Duloxetine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy).^
3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine through an interaction with the corresponding presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter. 5‐HT transport inhibitors block MDMA‐induced 5‐HT release in vitro or in animals and also attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA in humans. NE transport inhibitors similarly prevent the MDMA‐induced release of NE in cell assays and attenuate behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. Effects of the NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the response to MDMA in humans are currently investigated. Here we suggest evaluating effects of pretreatment with the combined 5‐HT and NE transport blocker duloxetine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The study will use a randomized double‐blind cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Duloxetine (120 mg) or placebo will be administered 16 h and 4 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments."
"3427","1","Investigation of serotonin-1A receptor function in the human psychopharmacology of MDMA.^
Serotonin (5-HT) release is the primary pharmacological mechanism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') action in the primate brain. Dopamine release and direct stimulation of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors also contributes to the overall action of MDMA. The role of 5-HT1A receptors in the human psychopharmacology of MDMA, however, has not yet been elucidated. In order to reveal the consequences of manipulation at the 5-HT1A receptor system on cognitive and subjective effects of MDMA, a receptor blocking study using the mixed beta-adrenoreceptor blocker/5-HT1A antagonist pindolol was performed. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design, 15 healthy male subjects were examined under placebo (PL), 20 mg pindolol (PIN), MDMA (1.6 mg/kg b.wt.), MDMA following pre-treatment with pindolol (PIN-MDMA). Tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery were used for the assessment of cognitive performance. Psychometric questionnaires were applied to measure effects of treatment on core dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness, mood and state anxiety. Compared with PL, MDMA significantly impaired sustained attention and visual-spatial memory, but did not affect executive functions. Pre-treatment with PIN did not significantly alter MDMA-induced impairment of cognitive performance and only exerted a minor modulating effect on two psychometric scales affected by MDMA treatment ('positive derealization' and 'dreaminess'). Our findings suggest that MDMA differentially affects higher cognitive functions, but does not support the hypothesis from animal studies, that some of the MDMA effects are causally mediated through action at the 5-HT1A receptor system."

"4787","1","Psychiatric Outcomes of Patients With Severe Agitation Following Administration of Prehospital Ketamine.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is an emerging drug used in the management of undifferentiated, severe agitation in the prehospital setting. However, prior work has indicated that ketamine may exacerbate psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to describe psychiatric outcomes in patients who receive prehospital ketamine for severe agitation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted at two tertiary academic medical centers, utilizing chart review of patients requiring prehospital sedation for severe agitation from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients received either intramuscular (IM) versus intravenous (IV) ketamine or IM versus IV benzodiazepine. The primary outcome was psychiatric inpatient admission with secondary outcomes including ED psychiatric evaluation and nonpsychiatric inpatient admission. Generalized estimating equations and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare cohorts. RESULTS: During the study period, 141 patient encounters met inclusion with 59 (42%) receiving prehospital ketamine. There were no statistically significant differences between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts for psychiatric inpatient admission (6.8% vs. 2.4%, difference = 4.3%, 95% CI = -2% to 12%, p = 0.23) or ED psychiatric evaluation (8.6% vs. 15%, difference = -6.8%, 95% CI = -18% to 5%, p = 0.23). Patients with schizophrenia who received ketamine did not require psychiatric inpatient admission (17% vs. 10%, difference = 6.7%, 95% CI = -46% to 79%, p = 0.63) or ED psychiatric evaluation (17% vs. 50%, difference = -33%, 95% CI = -100% to 33%, p = 0.55) significantly more than those who received benzodiazepines, although the subgroup was small (n = 16). While there was no significant difference in the nonpsychiatric admission rate between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts (35% vs. 51%, p = 0.082), nonpsychiatric admissions in the benzodiazepine cohort were largely driven by intubation (63% vs. 3.8%, difference = 59%, 95% CI = 38% to 79%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of prehospital ketamine for severe agitation was not associated with an increase in the rate of psychiatric evaluation in the emergency department or psychiatric inpatient admission when compared with benzodiazepine treatment, regardless of the patient's psychiatric history."

Introduction: For administering Spinal Anesthesia (SA) 0.5% bupivacaine is employed with Dexmedetomidine (DMT) as an adjuvant. Literature review reveals that either intrathecal or low-dose intravenous DMT can enhance the characteristics of SA with bupivacaine Aim: To evaluate the effect of a single bolus intravenous (i.v.) DMT 0.5 µg/kg given either before or after the SA in combination with intrathecal 0.5% bupivacaine compared with intrathecal bupivacaine plus DMT. Materials and Methods: A randomised, triple-blind, single-centre and placebo-controlled study was conducted at Gayatri Vidyaparishad Institute of Health care and medical technology, Marikavalasa, Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh, India, from April 2020 to December 2021. Eighty patients were allocated to four study groups of 20 each. Patients of group Intrathecal DMT (ITD) were given SA with 0.5% bupivacaine heavy 3.4 mL+5µg DMT, patients of group Before Spinal DMT (BSD) were given intravenous DMT before administering the SA with bupivacaine, patients of group After Spinal DMT (ASD) were given intravenous DMT after administering the SA with bupivacaine, and the patients of group Nil DMT (ND) or control group, were given SA with 0.5% bupivacaine heavy 3.4 mL. The primary outcome variable was the difference in the duration of analgesia. The secondary outcome variables were the differences in the onset and duration of the block both motor and sensory. Differences of the parametric data were analyzed using Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) and Tukey's Post Hoc test HSD Beta (Honestly significant difference). For analysis of non parametric data Chi-square test was used and a p-value of ≤0.05 was considered as statistically significant. results: Patients in the ITD group had a longer duration of analgesia of 280.7±5.0 min (vis-a-vis 215±9.34, 210.7±12.0 and 97.9±7.12 min in BSD,ASD and ND, respectively) with a statistically significant difference at a p-value <0.00001. They had a shorter duration of onset of motor block of 3.4±0.49 (visa-vis 4.6±0.53, 6.09±0.44 and 6.3±0.65 in BSD, ASD and ND groups, respectively) with a statistically significant difference at a p-value <0.00001. Duration of onset of the sensory block was 2.2±0.37 min in the patients of ITD group (vis-a-vis 3.2±4.76, 3.5±6.71 and 4±0.40 in BSD,ASD and ND groups, respectively) with a statistically significant difference at a p-value <0.00001. conclusion: Dexmedetomidine used as an adjuvant to intrathecal bupivacaine produces greater augmentation of duration of analgesia, earlier onset of sensory and motor block, more haemodynamic stability and fewer overall side effects compared to its intravenous bolus administration."

"6697","0","A Randomized Trial of the N-Methyl-d-Aspartate Receptor Glycine Site Antagonist Prodrug 4-Chlorokynurenine in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid‐acting antidepressant effects but is associated with psychotomimetic and other adverse effects. A 7‐chlorokynurenic acid is a potent and specific glycine site N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate receptor antagonist but crosses the blood‐brain barrier inefficiently. Its prodrug, L‐4‐chlorokynurenine (4‐Cl‐KYN), exerts acute and sustained antidepressant‐like effects in rodents and has no reported psychotomimetic effects in either rodents or healthy volunteers. This study examined whether 4‐Cl‐KYN has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment‐resistant depression. METHODS: After a 2‐week drug‐free period, 19 participants with treatment‐resistant depression were randomized to receive daily oral doses of 4‐Cl‐KYN monotherapy (1080 mg/d for 7 days, then 1440 mg/d for 7 days) or placebo for 14 days in a randomized, placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, crossover manner. The primary outcome measure was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score, assessed at several time points over a 2‐week period; secondary outcome measures included additional rating scale scores. Pharmacokinetic measures of 7‐chlorokynurenic acid and 4‐Cl‐KYN and pharmacodynamic assessments were obtained longitudinally and included 1H‐magnetic resonance spectroscopy brain glutamate levels, resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging, and plasma and cerebrospinal fluid measures of kynurenine metabolites and neurotrophic factors. RESULTS: Linear mixed models detected no treatment effects, as assessed by primary and secondary outcome measures. No difference was observed for any of the peripheral or central biological indices or for adverse effects at any time between groups. A 4‐Cl‐KYN was safe and well‐tolerated, with generally minimal associated adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: In this small crossover trial, 4‐Cl‐KYN monotherapy exerted no antidepressant effects at the doses and treatment duration studied.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02484456."

Breeksema, Sanne Y. Smith-Apeldoorn, Jolien Veraart, Wim van den Brink and Robert A. Schoevers (Psychopharmacology, 2022[Jan], Vol 239[1], 15-33). In the original article, there was an error in the author’s last name. The author’s last name has legally been changed from Schimmel to Schimmers. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-08995-001[/rid]). Background: Terminally ill patients may experience existential distress, depression, or anxiety, limiting quality of life in the final stage. Existing psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions have (time) limited efficacy. Psychedelic treatment may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option. Aim: Systematically review studies on psychedelic treatment with and without psychotherapy for existential distress, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill patients. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for original-data studies on the treatment of depression, anxiety, and existential distress with classical or a-typical psychedelics in patients with a terminal illness, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: A total of 1850 records were screened, and 33 articles were included in this review: 14 studies on classical psychedelics (DPT, LSD, and psilocybin) and 19 studies on atypical psychedelics (MDMA and ketamine). Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Both classical and a-typical psychedelics are promising treatment options in patients with terminal illness. To draw final conclusions on effectiveness and safety of psychedelics, we need larger high-quality studies for classical psychedelics and MDMA. Ketamine studies should pay more attention to existential dimensions of well-being and the psychotherapeutic context of the treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"
"987","1","Serotonergic psychedelics and personality: A systematic review of contemporary research.^
Serotonergic psychedelics act as agonists at cortical 5-HT(2A) receptors and seem to induce personality changes. We conducted a systematic review of studies assessing the effects of these drugs on personality. Papers published from 1985-2016 were included from PubMed, LILACS, and SciELO databases. Three hundred and sixty-nine studies were identified, and 18 were included. Specific personality traits, such as Absorption and Self-Transcendence, seem to influence the effects of psychedelics, and psychedelic drug users and nonusers appear to differ in some personality traits. Psychedelics administered in controlled settings may induce personality changes, such as increased Openness and Self-Transcendence. Increases in global brain entropy induced by acute psychedelic administration predicted changes in Openness, and Self-Transcendence was negatively correlated with cortical thinning of the posterior cingulate cortex in long-term religious ayahuasca users. Acute and long-term use of psychedelics is associated with personality changes that appear to be modulated by 5-HT(2A) receptors. These changes seem to induce therapeutic effects that should be further explored in randomized controlled studies."

BACKGROUND: Drugs like ecstasy, cocaine, and counterfeit prescription pills can contain fentanyl. We examined knowledge about potential adulteration/contamination of such drugs among people attending electronic dance music (EDM) parties. METHODS: Adults in New York City were surveyed entering randomly selected EDM parties during the summers of 2018 (n=1,029) and 2019 (n=559). Surveys assessed perceptions that: 1) ecstasy/Molly can contain adulterants more dangerous than MDMA, 2) cocaine can contain fentanyl, and 3) prescription pills from non-pharmacy sources can contain fentanyl. We compared prevalence of perceptions between 2018 and 2019. RESULTS: Prevalence of agreeing that cocaine can contain fentanyl increased from 42.1% to 58.6%, a 39.2% increase (p=.003). Increases in agreement were not significant regarding ecstasy potentially containing adulterants (55.0% vs. 59.0%) and non-pharmacy prescription drugs potentially containing fentanyl (46.8% vs. 52.9%). Those reporting past-year ecstasy use in particular reported increased agreement that ecstasy can be adulterated (from 52.9% to 80.0%, a 51.2% increase; p<.001) and those reporting past-year cocaine use reported increased agreement that cocaine can be adulterated (from 48.2% to 70.7%, a 46.7% increase; p=.016).

"868","1","The incidence of unpleasant dreams after sub-anaesthetic ketamine.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine is an N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist with psychotogenic effects and for which there are diverse reports of whether pleasant or unpleasant dreams result during anaesthesia, post-operatively or after sub-anaesthetic use. OBJECTIVE: To assess in healthy volunteers the incidence of unpleasant dreams over the three nights after receiving a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine, in comparison to placebo, and with retrospective home nightmare frequency as a covariate. METHOD: Thirty healthy volunteers completed questionnaires about retrospective home dream recall and were then given either ketamine (n = 19, males = 9, mean age = 23.5 years; mean ketamine blood plasma = 175.29 ng/mL) or placebo (n = 11, males = 5, mean age = 25.4 years). Dream recall and pleasantness/unpleasantness of dream content were recorded by questionnaire at home for the three nights after infusion. RESULTS: Ketamine resulted in significantly more mean dream unpleasantness relative to placebo and caused a threefold increase in the odds ratio for the incidence of an unpleasant dream. The number of dreams reported over the three nights did not differ between the groups. The incidence of unpleasant dreams after ketamine use was predicted by retrospectively assessed nightmare frequency at home. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine causes unpleasant dreams over the three post-administration nights. This may be evidence of a residual psychotogenic effect that is not found on standard self-report symptomatology measures or a result of disturbed sleep electrophysiology."

Eight 'stable' and four 'variable' college age subjects were given 160μg/kg psilocybin under conditions of sensory attenuation. Stability was defined by the magnitude of the standard deviation on handwriting area under predrug conditions. Only the variable subjects, the large standard deviants, responded to the drug with a significant decrease in mean pulse rate and increase in handwriting area. They also reported consistently more intense experiences under psilocybin than the small standard deviants. The degree of variability on perceptual behavioral measures, such as the SD on handwriting area, is significantly related to, and therefore a predictor of, the intensity of the ensuing drug induced experience."

"4335","1","Comparison of effects of intravenous midazolam and ketamine on emergence agitation in children: Randomized controlled trial.^
OBJECTIVE: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of preoperative midazolam or ketamine on the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) following sevoflurane anaesthesia in children. METHODS: Paediatric patients (2-6 years old) undergoing ophthalmic surgery were allocated to receive premedication with either 0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg ketamine. Incidence of EA and postoperative pain scores were recorded at 10-min intervals in the postanaesthetic care unit (PACU). The use of EA rescue medications (fentanyl or midazolam) was recorded. RESULTS: The incidence of EA was significantly lower in the ketamine group (n = 33) than the midazolam group (n = 34) at 10 and 20 min after transfer to PACU. There was no significant difference in overall incidence of EA. The frequency of midazolam use as rescue medication was significantly lower in the katamine group than in the midazolam group. CONCLUSION: Premedication with ketamine is more effective than midazolam in preventing EA during the early emergence period after sevoflurane anaesthesia in children."
"7126","1","Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^
Rationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag."
"6728","0","Reducing substance use and risky sexual behaviour among drug users in Durban, South Africa: Assessing the impact of community-level risk-reduction interventions.^
Alcohol and other drug (AOD) use is increasingly recognised as having a direct and indirect effect on the transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). However, there is evidence to suggest that drug- and sex-related HIV risk-reduction interventions targeted at drug users within drug treatment centres or via community outreach efforts can lead to positive health outcomes. This study aimed to test whether a community-level intervention aimed at AOD users has an impact on risky AOD use and sexual risk behaviour. In 2007, in collaboration with a local non-governmental organisation (NGO) in Durban, an initiative was begun to implement a number of harm reduction strategies for injection and non-injection drug users. The NGO recruited peer outreach workers who received intensive initial training, which was followed by six-monthly monitoring and evaluation of their performance. Participants had to be 16 years of age or older, and self-reported alcohol and/or drug users. Peer outreach workers completed a face-to-face baseline questionnaire with participants which recorded risk behaviours and a risk-reduction plan was developed with participants which consisted of reducing injection (if applicable) and non-injection drug use and sex-related risks. Other components of the intervention included distribution of condoms, risk-reduction counselling, expanded access to HIV Testing Services, HIV/sexually transmitted infection care and treatment, and referrals to substance abuse treatment and social services. At follow-up, the baseline questionnaire was completed again and participants were also asked the frequency of reducing identified risk behaviours. Baseline information was collected from 138 drug users recruited into the study through community-based outreach, and who were subsequently followed up between 2010 and 2012. No injection drug users were reached. The data presented here are for first contact (baseline) and the final follow-up contact with the participants. There were no decreases in drug use practices such as use of cannabis, heroin, cocaine and Ecstasy after the intervention with drug users; however, there was a significant reduction in alcohol use following the intervention. While there was a substantial increase in the proportion of participants using drugs daily as opposed to more often, the reduction in the frequency of drug use was not statistically significant. Following the intervention, drug users had significantly fewer sexual partners, but there were no significant differences following the intervention with regard to frequency of sex or use of condoms. Substance use in general and during sex was, however, decreased. While the findings were mixed, the study shows that it is possible to provide HIV risk-reduction services to a population of substance users who are less likely to receive services through community outreach, and provide risk-reduction information, condoms and condom demonstration and other services. More intensive interventions might be needed to have a substantial impact on substance use and substance use-related HIV risk behaviours."

Introduction: Acute bupropion (dopamine/noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor) administration significantly improved time trial performance and increased core temperature in the heat (30 degrees C). Purpose: The present study was performed to examine the effect of a dopaminergic reuptake inhibitor on exercise capacity and thermoregulation during prolonged exercise in temperate and warm conditions. Methods: Eight healthy well-trained male cyclists participated in this study. Subjects ingested either placebo (PLA; 20 mg) or methylphenidate (MPH; Ritalin; 20 mg) 1 h before the start of exercise in temperate (18 degrees C) or warm (30 degrees C) conditions and cycled for 60 min at 55% W-max, immediately followed by a time trial (TT; PLA18 and MPH18; PLA30 and MPH30) to measure exercise performance. Results: MPH did not influence TT performance at 18 degrees C (P = 0.397). TT was completed 16% faster in MPH30 (38.1 +/- 6.4 min) than in PLA30 (45.4 +/- 7.3 min; P = 0.049). In the heat T-core was significantly higher at rest (P = 0.009), and throughout the TT in MPH30 (P < 0.018), reaching values above 40 degrees C. Throughout MPH30, heart rates were significantly higher (P < 0.05). Conclusions: These results show that MPH has a clear ergogenic effect that was not apparent in 18 degrees C. The combination of a dopamine reuptake inhibitor and exercise in the heat clearly improved performance and caused hyperthermia without any change in the perception of effort or thermal stress compared with the PLA trial. This response may potentially increase the risk of developing heat illness during exercise in individuals taking drugs of this nature."

To establish efficacy, we will investigate a single dose of psilocybin versus placebo in a randomised, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled 12 weeks clinical trial. 90 patients, aged 20‐70 years, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and treatment seeking will be recruited from the community via advertisement and referrals from general practitioners and hospital units. The psilocybin or placebo is administered within a protocol of psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out one, four, eight‐ and 12 weeks post dosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow‐up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes include 1) phosphatidyl‐ethanol as an objective biomarker for alcohol consumption 2) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range and 3) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome. Furthermore, we will investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of the possible treatment effects by use of functional magnetic resonance brain imaging one week post dosing."

"6745","0","Analysis of new designer drugs in post-mortem blood using high-resolution mass spectrometry.^
An analytical method was developed and validated for the purpose of detecting and quantifying 37 new designer drugs including cathinones, hallucinogenic phenethylamines and piperazines. Using only 100 μL whole blood, a salting-out-assisted liquid-liquid extraction with acetonitrile was performed to isolate target compounds followed by chromatographic separation using a Waters ACQUITY ultra performance liquid chromatograph coupled to a Waters XEVO quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer. Mephedrone-d3 was used as an internal standard. A gradient elution was used in combination with a Waters ACQUITY HSS C18 column (2.1 × 150 mm, 1.8 μm). Samples were analyzed using the detector in positive electrospray ionization mode with MSE acquisition. All compounds of interest were resolved in a 15 min run time and positively identified based on accurate mass of the molecular ion, two product ions and retention time. All analyte calibration curves were linear over the range of 0.05-2 mg/L with most correlation coefficient (r2) values >0.98. The limits of detection were within the range of 0.007-0.07 mg/L and limits of quantification within 0.05-0.1 mg/L. All analytes were stable 48 h after extraction and most were stable in blood after 1 week stored in a refrigerator and 3 freeze-thaw cycles. No carryover was observed up to 10 mg/L and no interferences from common therapeutic drugs or endogenous compounds. Recoveries ranged from 71 to 100% and matrix effects were assessed for blank, post-mortem and decomposed blood. All bias and % coefficient of variation values were within the acceptable values of ±15 and ≤15%, respectively (±20 and ≤20% at lower limit of quantification). The method was applied to several forensic cases where the subject exhibited behavior characteristic of designer drug intoxication and where routine screening for a panel of drugs was negative. © The Author 2015.

"8414","1","Amygdala response to processing emotion at baseline predicts antidepressant effect of ketamine.^
Background: The amygdala is implicated in the processing of emotional stimuli, and is affected in major depressive disorder (MDD). Here we evaluate the potential for baseline amygdala response, during the processing of emotional faces, to predict subsequent treatment response to the NMDA antagonist ketamine. Methods: Sixteen unmedicated depressed MDD patients (7 males) participated in an fMRI study. Emotional faces were presented under 2 conditions: 1) judge emotion as positive (happy/neutral) or negative (sad/angry) and 2) judge gender, each with two difficulty levels, faces presented straight up or upside‐down. Subjects subsequently participated in a placebo‐controlled, crossover trial with i.v. ketamine (.5mg/kg). Depressive symptoms were assessed using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). A 5mm radius sphere was placed in the left and right amygdala based on previously defined peak voxels showing differential hemodynamic responses to emotional faces before and after antidepressant treatment. BOLD signal estimates were averaged across voxels for each subject/ task condition, and correlated with percent change on MADRS (from baseline to 230 minutes post‐infusion). Significance was defined as p< 0.0125 (= 0.05/4 task conditions, judging gender/emotion, positive/negative emotion). Results: BOLD response in right amygdala correlated ( r>+0.6, p< 0.0125) with treatment response when judging positive and negative emotion presented straight up, and when judging positive emotion presented upside‐down. Conclusions: Neural activity in the right amygdala prior to treatment, during an overt emotional processing task, correlated with subsequent treatment response to ketamine. Thus, pre‐treatment amygdala activity measured in currently depressed MDD patients during emotion processing may provide a biomarker of subsequent treatment response."
"2227","1","Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^
RATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone. Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate, all induced significant impairment of cognitive function."
"7077","1","Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study."
"3221","0","Dance/movement therapy for improving balance ability and bone mineral density in long-term patients with schizophrenia: a randomized controlled trial.^
Fractures are common accidents for long-term hospitalized patients with schizophrenia (SZ) in psychiatric hospitals, and once they occur, patients usually endure the pain of fractures for a long time. Accumulating evidence has supported the implementation of dance/movement therapy (DMT) as a promising intervention for patients with SZ. However, no research has been conducted to investigate its role in balance ability in SZ. This study was designed to investigate the efficacy of a 12-week DMT intervention in bone mineral density and balance ability in patients with SZ using a randomized, controlled trial design. A total of 58 veterans with SZ were randomly assigned to the DMT intervention group (n = 29) and the treatment-as-usual (TAU) group (n = 29). Bone mineral density (BMD) and balance ability were measured in both groups at two measurement points (at baseline and at the end of Week 12). We found that patients in the DMT intervention group had significant improvements in BMD and balance ability compared with the TAU group by using repeated measures analysis of variance. Treatment with DMT demonstrated a significant improvement in BMD from baseline to week 12 (0.03, 95% CI: 0.01-0.05). For the Berg total score and static and dynamic balance, the mean changes in the DMT group were 7.3 (95% CI: 5.6-9.0), 4.0 (95% CI: 0.9-7.1), and 3.7 (95% CI: 2.6-4.8), respectively. Regression analysis showed that baseline BMD was a significant predictor of improvement in BMD from baseline to week 12 in the DMT group (β = 0.58, p < 0.001). Our results suggest for the first time that DMT intervention may be effective in beneficially regulating BMD and balance ability in SZ patients."
"4631","1","Cortisol levels and MDMA-induced memory impairment.^
Objective: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone1) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone1 (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with Metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA."
"8118","0","Ethics and ego dissolution: the case of psilocybin.^
Despite the fact that psychedelics were proscribed from medical research half a century ago, recent, early-phase trials on psychedelics have suggested that they bring novel benefits to patients in the treatment of several mental and substance use disorders. When beneficial, the psychedelic experience is characterized by features unlike those of other psychiatric and medical treatments. These include senses of losing self-importance, ineffable knowledge, feelings of unity and connection with others and encountering 'deep' reality or God. In addition to symptom relief, psychedelic experiences often lead to significant changes in a patient's personality and worldview. Focusing on the case of psilocybin, we argue that the peculiar features of psychedelics pose certain novel risks, which warrant an enhanced informed consent process-one that is more comprehensive than what may be typical for other psychiatric medications. We highlight key issues that should be focused on during the consent process and suggest discussion prompts for enhanced consent in psychedelic psychiatry. Finally, we respond to potential objections before concluding with a discussion of ethical considerations that will arise as psychedelics proceed from highly controlled research environments into mainstream clinical psychiatry."
"9565","1","Comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^
Objectives: Anhedonia is a common, persistent, and disabling phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD. Methods: Ninety-seven individuals suffering from MDD (n = 77) or BD (n = 20) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered over 40 min. Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion, respectively. Results: Anti-anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5% (95% confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6%) and 30.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3%), respectively. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

"2746","1","Description of Adverse Events in a Cohort of Dance Festival Attendees with Stimulant-Induced Severe Agitation Treated with Dissociative-Dose Ketamine.^
BACKGROUND: Emergency clinicians often treat severe agitation resulting from intoxicants, psychiatric illness, and other CNS or systemic diseases. Recreational drugs-especially stimulants-are frequently used by attendees of electronic dance music festivals (EDMFs), and festivalgoers may become dangerously agitated and pose an immediate threat to themselves and others. Although benzodiazepines and antipsychotics are classically used to treat severe agitation, these medications are burdened by safety concerns including respiratory depression and cardiac arrhythmias. The effects of ketamine when used to treat severe agitation in an exclusive cohort of patients with psychostimulant drug-induced toxicity (PDIT) has not previously been reported, and existing literature describes a widely variant safety profile when ketamine is used for sedation of the agitated patient. OBJECTIVE: To describe ketamine's adverse event profile when used to treat patients with severe agitation resulting from PDIT. METHODS: This is a retrospective, observational study enrolling consecutive patients who presented for medical attention at a large outdoor EDMF over a period of eight days on two consecutive weekends in the summer of 2017. The EDMF had an estimated attendance of 40,000 per weekend. A medical tent was set up on-site; patients were managed by a team of EMS providers, nurses and emergency physicians. Medications used, adverse events and the need for repeat dosing were abstracted from prehospital care reports. RESULTS: Over the course of eight days, 1081 of 1186 patients who were evaluated in the medical tent had a recorded chief complaint. 274 of these patients (25.3%) had a chief complaint of altered mental status. In patients presenting with AMS, 68 patients (24.8%) had severe agitation that was treated with dissociative-dose (≥4 mg/kg) intramuscular ketamine. The mean initial dose of ketamine was 308 mg. There were four serious adverse events (5.9%): Two patients (2.9%) had copious hypersalivation treated with atropine, one patient (1.5%) had transient apnea requiring assisted ventilation, and one patient (1.5%) was intubated and transported to the hospital. 42 patients (61.8%) required redosing of calming medications. All patients who received ketamine except the single patient who was intubated and transported were observed in the medical tent until resolution of symptoms and discharged back to the festival. CONCLUSION: In this cohort of festival attendees who developed stimulant-induced severe agitation and were treated with dissociative-dose ketamine, serious adverse events occurred in 5.9% of patients including one patient who was intubated."

Aims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives. There was little evidence to suggest ecstasy use was limited to high-income-earning professionals. © NZMA."

A sensitive high-performance liquid chromatographic method with fluorescence detection to determine 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphethamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphethamine (MDA) in human and rat whole blood or plasma samples was developed by using 4-(4,5-diphenyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)benzoyI chloride (DIB-Cl) as a label. MDMA and MDA in a small amount of blood sample (ca 100 μL) were extracted by liquid-liquid extraction with ethyl acetate, and were derivatized with DIB-Cl under mild conditions (10 min at room temperature). A good separation of DIB-derivatives could be achieved within 45 min using a commercially available ODS colurnn with an isocratic eluent of 10 mm citric acid-20 mm Na2HPO4 aqueous buffer (pH 4.0)-CH3CN-CH3OH (50:45:5, v/v/v %). The calibration curves prepared with 1-methyl-3-phenylpropylamine (MPPA) as an internal standard showed good linearity (r = 0.999) with 0.36-0.83 ng /mL detection linidt at a signal-to-noise ratio of 3. MDMA and MDA in rat whole blood could be monitored for 6 h after a single administration of N4DMA (2.2 mg/kg, i.p.). The pharmacokinetic: parameters for MDMA and MDA obtained by triplicate measurements were 426 ± 23 and 39 ± 6 ng/mL (Cmax), 20 ± 5 and 100 ± 10 min (Tmax), respectively.

OBJECTIVE: Serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the most efficient pharmacological treatment of obsessive‐compulsive disorders (OCD). Previous studies have suggested that some peripheral serotonergic parameters can be used to predict the clinical outcome of the treatment of OCD patients with SRIs. We tried to identify further peripheral serotonergic parameters that could help predict the clinical outcome of SRI treatment in a sample of patients with OCD. METHODS: We compared 19 OCD patients before and after 8 weeks of SRI treatment with 19 sex‐matched and age‐matched controls. We assessed clinical improvement and whole‐blood serotonin (5‐HT) concentration, platelet 5‐HT transporter (5‐HTT) and 5‐HT2A receptor binding characteristics and platelet IP3 content. RESULTS: Before treatment, OCD patients had higher platelet IP3 content and fewer 5‐HTT binding sites than the controls. Treatment with SRIs further lowered the number of 5‐HTT binding sites, normalized platelet IP3 contents, and lowered the number of platelet 5‐HT2A binding sites and whole‐blood 5‐HT concentrations below control values. The patients who improved most following SRI treatment had higher whole‐blood 5‐HT concentrations before treatment. CONCLUSION: Our results confirm that whole‐blood 5‐HT concentration is a predictor for clinical improvement and indicate that abnormal intracellular mechanisms may be involved in OCD patients, in particular, the overstimulation of the phosphoinositide signaling system."

INTRODUCTION: The understanding of biological responses to psychedelics with antidepressant potential is imperative. Here we report how a set of acute parameters, namely emotional (depressive symptoms), cognitive (psychedelic experience), and physiological (salivary cortisol), recorded during an ayahuasca dosing session, modulated serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serum cortisol (SC), serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR). METHODS: Results were analyzed 2 days after the psychedelic intervention (ayahuasca) versus placebo in both patients with treatment-resistant depression and healthy volunteers. These measures were assessed as part of a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (n = 72). RESULTS: Results revealed that larger reductions of depressive symptoms during the dosing session significantly moderated higher levels of SC in patients. Whereas lesser changes in salivary cortisol levels during the ayahuasca intervention were related to higher BDNF levels in patients with a larger clinical response in the reduction in depressive symptoms. No moderator was found for patient's CAR, IL-6, and CRP responses to ayahuasca and for all biomarker responses to ayahuasca in healthy controls and in the placebo group. DISCUSSION: In summary, some specific emotional and physiological parameters during experimental ayahuasca session were revealed as critical moderators of the improvement of major depression biomarkers, mainly BDNF and SC two days after ayahuasca intake. These findings contribute to paving the way for future studies investigating the biological antidepressant response to psychedelic therapy."
"717","1","Effects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward.^
RATIONALE: +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") reportedly produces unique subjective effects, including increased sociability, feelings of closeness with others, and reduced interpersonal defensiveness. Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO. CONCLUSIONS: These data present the first evidence that MDMA may increase sociability in humans both by diminishing responses to threatening stimuli and enhancing responses to rewarding social signals."

Since the 1990s, psychedelics experience a renaissance in biomedical research. The so-called classic psychedelics include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline and ayahuasca. Characteristic effects like alterations in sensory perception, as well as emotion- and self-processing are induced by stimulation of serotonin 2A receptors in cortical areas. The new paradigm of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy suggests a therapeutic framework in which a safely conducted psychedelic experience is integrated into a continuous psychotherapeutic process. First randomized, controlled trials with psilocybin show promising efficacy, tolerability, and adherence in the treatment of unipolar depression. On the other hand, classic psychedelics seem to be associated with the induction of mania, which is an important issue to consider for the design of research and clinical protocols. So called atypical psychedelics are a heterogeneous group with overlapping subjective effects but different neurobiological mechanisms. Two examples of therapeutic value in psychiatry are 3,4-methyl​enedioxy​methamphetamine (MDMA) and ketamine. Since 2020 the ketamine enantiomer esketamine has been granted international approval for treatment-resistant unipolar depression, and also first evidence exists for the therapeutic efficacy of ketamine in bipolar depression. Whether psychedelics will fulfil current expectations and find their way into broader clinical use will depend on future rigorous clinical trials with larger sample sizes. A well-considered therapeutic and legal framework will be crucial for these substances to create new treatment settings and a potential paradigm shift."
"1437","1","Cognitive function of patients with treatment-resistant depression after a single low dose of ketamine infusion.^
BACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function."
"6191","1","Naturalistic Study of Microdosing With Psilocybin.^
Sub‐threshold doses of serotonergic psychedelics are frequently consumed as cognitive enhancers, and due to their purported positive effects on mood, energy and creativity (""microdosing""). The acute and short‐term effects of psilocybin (the psychoactive compound of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms) on several variables will be investigated, comprising spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological brain activity, perception and cognitive function (cognitive flexibility, attention, inhibitory control, conscious access, visual perception), creativity (problem solving, divergent and convergent thinking), behavior (actigraphy and sleep patterns, natural language production) and several domains related to well‐being and mental health of the participants. This study is simultaneously naturalistic (i.e. recruited subjects are intrinsically motivated to microdose, as they have decided to embark in a microdosing protocol) and controlled by expectations, following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design. Participants will microdose according to the following schedule: Two sessions (0.5 g dried Psilocybin mushrooms vs. dried edible mushroom material without psychoactive effects as a placebo condition) will be conducted. A third party will be in charge of generating their active dose and placebo capsules, and they will also implement a blinding procedure. Each session will span one week of measurements. Subjects will be given a smartwatch to monitor activity and sleeping patterns at the beginning of the week. At days 3 and 5, subjects will take capsules with active mushroom material or placebo, and then several variables will be recorded. Experiments will be conducted in a setting that is natural and comfortable for the participants, e.g. their homes. The main outcome measures consist of resting state activity recorded with EEG, evoked response potentials and performance during cognitive tasks, behavioral variables obtained with actigraphy and automated sleep scoring, natural language analysis, and several measurs self‐reported via standarized questionnaires. After completion, this study will provide direct evidence concerning the efficacy of microdosing for cognitive enhancement under natural conditions, i.e. those most frequently used by individuals who microdose, as well as provide information concerning the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms."
"4925","1","Stability study of LSD under various storage conditions.^
A controlled study was undertaken to determine the stability of LSD in pooled urine samples. The concentrations of LSD in urine samples were followed over time at various temperatures, in different types of storage containers, at various exposures to different wavelengths of light, and at varying pH values. LSD concentrations were measured quantitatively by the Abuscreen RIA and by HPLC using a fluorescence detection method. Good correlation was observed between the immunoassay and the fluorescent integrity of the LSD molecule. Thermostability studies were conducted in the dark with various containers. These studies demonstrated no significant loss in LSD concentration at 25 degrees C for up to 4 weeks. After 4 weeks of incubation, a 30% loss in LSD concentration at 37 degrees C and up to a 40% at 45 degrees C were observed. Urine fortified with LSD and stored in amber glass or nontransparent polyethylene containers showed no change in concentration under any light conditions. Stability of LSD in transparent containers under light was dependent on the distance between the light source and the samples, the wavelength of light, exposure time, and the intensity of light. After prolonged exposure to heat in alkaline pH conditions, 10 to 15% of the parent LSD epimerized to iso-LSD. Under acidic conditions, less than 5% of the LSD was converted to iso-LSD. We also demonstrated that trace amounts of metal ions in buffer or urine could catalyze the decomposition of LSD and that this process can be avoided by the addition of EDTA. This study demonstrates the importance of proper storage conditions of LSD in urine in order to insure proper analytical testing results over time."
"1739","0","Molecular and Functional Imaging Studies of Psychedelic Drug Action in Animals and Humans.^
Hallucinogens are a loosely defined group of compounds including LSD, N,N-dimethyltryptamines, mescaline, psilocybin/psilocin, and 2,5-dimethoxy-4-methamphetamine (DOM), which can evoke intense visual and emotional experiences. We are witnessing a renaissance of research interest in hallucinogens, driven by increasing awareness of their psychotherapeutic potential. As such, we now present a narrative review of the literature on hallucinogen binding in vitro and ex vivo, and the various molecular imaging studies with positron emission tomography (PET) or single photon emission computer tomography (SPECT). In general, molecular imaging can depict the uptake and binding distribution of labelled hallucinogenic compounds or their congeners in the brain, as was shown in an early PET study with N(1)-([(11)C]-methyl)-2-bromo-LSD ([(11)C]-MBL); displacement with the non-radioactive competitor ketanserin confirmed that the majority of [(11)C]-MBL specific binding was to serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors. However, interactions at serotonin 5HT(1A) and other classes of receptors and pleotropic effects on second messenger pathways may contribute to the particular experiential phenomenologies of LSD and other hallucinogenic compounds. Other salient aspects of hallucinogen action include permeability to the blood-brain barrier, the rates of metabolism and elimination, and the formation of active metabolites. Despite the maturation of radiochemistry and molecular imaging in recent years, there has been only a handful of PET or SPECT studies of radiolabeled hallucinogens, most recently using the 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist N-(2[(11)CH(3)O]-methoxybenzyl)-2,5-dimethoxy- 4-bromophenethylamine ([(11)C]Cimbi-36). In addition to PET studies of target engagement at neuroreceptors and transporters, there is a small number of studies on the effects of hallucinogenic compounds on cerebral perfusion ([(15)O]-water) or metabolism ([(18)F]-fluorodeoxyglucose/FDG). There remains considerable scope for basic imaging research on the sites of interaction of hallucinogens and their cerebrometabolic effects; we expect that hybrid imaging with PET in conjunction with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) should provide especially useful for the next phase of this research."

"6350","0","Psychedelics.^
Psychedelics (serotonergic hallucinogens) are powerful psychoactive substances that alter perception and mood and affect numerous cognitive processes. They are generally considered physiologically safe and do not lead to dependence or addiction. Their origin predates written history, and they were employed by early cultures in many sociocultural and ritual contexts. After the virtually contemporaneous discovery of (5R,8R)-(+)-lysergic acid-N,N-diethylamide (LSD)-25 and the identification of serotonin in the brain, early research focused intensively on the possibility that LSD and other psychedelics had a serotonergic basis for their action. Today there is a consensus that psychedelics are agonists or partial agonists at brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptors, with particular importance on those expressed on apical dendrites of neocortical pyramidal cells in layer V. Several useful rodent models have been developed over the years to help unravel the neurochemical correlates of serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor activation in the brain, and a variety of imaging techniques have been employed to identify key brain areas that are directly affected by psychedelics. Recent and exciting developments in the field have occurred in clinical research, where several double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in patients with cancer-related psychosocial distress have demonstrated unprecedented positive relief of anxiety and depression. Two small pilot studies of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy also have shown positive benefit in treating both alcohol and nicotine addiction. Recently, blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging and magnetoencephalography have been employed for in vivo brain imaging in humans after administration of a psychedelic, and results indicate that intravenously administered psilocybin and LSD produce decreases in oscillatory power in areas of the brain's default mode network."
"3619","1","Urinary catecholamine excretion following lysergic acid diethylamide in man.^
Two separate controlled experiments in man measured the excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vanilmandelic acid (VMA) and total metanephrines following lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), comparisons being made with an injection of a similar dose of epinephrine in the one instance and with a no-treament period in the other. LSD (2 mcg/kg) produced insignificant changes in urinary catecholamine excretion over a four-hour period while epinephrine (3 mcg/kg) evoked substantial increases in excretion of epinephrine, VMA and metanephrines with a concomitant decrease in norepinephrine excretion. Sympathomimetic effects of these doses of LSD were apparent clinically and as judged by the degree of elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFA); the response to epinephrine was brief and intense, while that to LSD was sustained and more gradual in onset. In the second experiment, LSD (1.5 and 2 mcg/kg) produced no more changes in catecholamine excretion over an eight-hour period than a control no-treatment trial. Although LSD has many sympathomimetic actions, these are not adequately reflected by measurement of urinary catecholamine excretion. These experiments suggest that measurement of urinary catecholamines is a poor gauge of sustained sympathomimetic effects. © 1967 Springer-Verlag."
"3244","0","Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy for People with Eating Disorders.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: A growing body of research suggests psychedelic-assisted therapy (PAT) may be safe and effective for a variety of mental health conditions. Among these, eating disorders have been a recent target of interest. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the potential mechanisms and use of PAT in people diagnosed with eating disorders, with a focus on anorexia nervosa. RECENT FINDINGS: Classic psychedelics may have transdiagnostic efficacy through several mechanisms relevant to eating disorder pathology. Interest in, and efforts to increase access to PAT are both high. Early clinical trials are focused on establishing the safety and utility of this treatment in eating disorders, and efficacy remains unclear. High-quality published data to support the use of PAT for people with eating disorders remains lacking. Recent studies however suggest PAT has the potential to augment the efficacy of current interventions for these difficult-to-treat conditions."
"71","1","The effects of ketamine on prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission in healthy and depressed subjects.^
The ability of ketamine administration to activate prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission is thought to be a key mechanism contributing to its transient psychotomimetic effects and its delayed and sustained antidepressant effects. Rodent studies employing carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C MRS) methods have shown ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists to transiently increase measures reflecting glutamate-glutamine cycling and glutamate neurotransmission in the frontal cortex. However, there are not yet direct measures of glutamate neurotransmission in vivo in humans to support these hypotheses. The current first-level pilot study employed a novel prefrontal (13)C MRS approach similar to that used in the rodent studies for direct measurement of ketamine effects on glutamate-glutamine cycling. Twenty-one participants (14 healthy and 7 depressed) completed two (13)C MRS scans during infusion of normal saline or subanesthetic doses of ketamine. Compared to placebo, ketamine increased prefrontal glutamate-glutamine cycling, as indicated by a 13% increase in (13)C glutamine enrichment (t = 2.4, p = 0.02). We found no evidence of ketamine effects on oxidative energy production, as reflected by (13)C glutamate enrichment. During ketamine infusion, the ratio of (13)C glutamate/glutamine enrichments, a putative measure of neurotransmission strength, was correlated with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (r = -0.54, p = 0.048). These findings provide the most direct evidence in humans to date that ketamine increases glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex, a mechanism previously linked to schizophrenia pathophysiology and implicated in the induction of rapid antidepressant effects."
"9242","1","Safety and Tolerability of the Acute Ketamine Treatment in Treatment-Resistant Depression: Focus on Comorbidities Interplay with Dissociation and Psychomimetic Symptoms.^
There is evidence for ketamine use in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Several safety concerns arise regarding adverse drug reactions in specific subpopulations. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of intravenous ketamine treatment in relation to dissociative and psychotic measures in TRD inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar depression (BP) with comorbidities. In total, 49 inpatients with MDD or BP were treated with ketamine following the registered naturalistic observational protocol in a tertiary reference unit for mood disorders (NCT04226963). This dataset represents an intermittent analysis of an observational study performed for interim modeling of observational learning. The observations were applied to the inhomogeneous TRD population in a single site with no blinding and were limited to acute administration. The presence of epilepsy was significantly associated with an elevation in the BPRS over time (p = 0.008). Psychotic symptomatology with BPRS scores for comorbid conditions excluding epilepsy turned out to be insignificant (p = 0.198) regardless of the diagnosis. However, for a subgroup of patients with epilepsy (n = 6), a substantial fluctuation was seen across all administrations in the time course of the study. The study results contribute to the literature on the safety and tolerability profile of CNS adverse drug reactions in short-term treatment with intravenous ketamine as an add-on intervention to current standard-of-care psychotropic medication in TRD-MDD and TRD-BP inpatients with comorbidities. The careful consideration of comorbidities and concomitant medication is needed with ketamine administration along with close-clinical supervision at every visit."
"8639","1","Psychiatric profiles of mothers who take Ecstasy/MDMA during pregnancy: reduced depression 1 year after giving birth and quitting Ecstasy.^
BACKGROUND: The recreational drug MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) or 'Ecstasy' is associated with heightened psychiatric distress and feelings of depression. The Drugs and Infancy Study (DAISY) monitored the psychiatric symptom profiles of mothers who used Ecstasy/MDMA while pregnant, and followed them over the first year post-partum. METHODS: We compared 28 young women whom took MDMA during their pregnancy with a polydrug control group of 68 women who took other psychoactive drugs while pregnant. The Brief Symptom Inventory (BSI) was completed for several periods: The first trimester of pregnancy; and 1, 4 and 12 months after childbirth. Recreational drug use was monitored at each time point. RESULTS: During the first trimester of pregnancy, MDMA-using mothers reported higher depression scores than the polydrug controls. At 1 year after childbirth, their BSI depression scores were significantly lower, now closer to the control group values. At the same time point, their self-reported use of MDMA became nearly zero, in contrast to their continued use of Cannabis/marijuana, nicotine and alcohol. We found significant symptom reductions in those with BSI obsessive-compulsive and interpersonal sensitivity, following Ecstasy/MDMA cessation. CONCLUSIONS: The findings from this unique prospective study of young recreational drug-using mothers are consistent with previous reports of improved psychiatric health after quitting MDMA."
"7055","1","Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^
BACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment."
"9348","1","Identifying the Prevalence and Correlates of Ecstasy and Other Club Drug (EOCD) Use Among High School Seniors.^
A plethora of anecdotal evidence has suggested that the use of ""club drugs,"" such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), Ketamine, Gamma hydroxybutyrate(GHB), and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""), is a serious problem among youth across the United States. Unfortunately, little scientific evidence exists to support this contention. In the current study, we examine the ecstasy and other club drug (EOCD)-using behaviors of 1,561 high school seniors surveyed in 2000 through the Monitoring the Future (MTF) study. Prevalence estimates of EOCD use are generated and associations between EOCD use, demographic characteristics, and alcohol and other drug (AOD) use are explored. Twelve-month self-reports for ecstasy, LSD, Ketamine, and GHB were 8%, 6%, 2%, and 1%, respectively. Compared to students who reported no use of EOCD during the 12 months preceding the interview, 12-month EOCD users were significantly more likely to be white, to live in the suburbs, and to have used all other drugs of abuse during the 12 months preceding the interview. Logistic regression identified that the strongest predictors of 12-month EOCD use were the use of heroin and other psychedelic drugs during the 12 months preceding the interview. Implications for these findings are discussed. © 2003 by The Haworth Press, Inc. All rights reserved."
"7681","1","Tri-city study of Ecstasy use problems: A latent class analysis.^
This study used latent class analysis to examine distinctive subtypes of Ecstasy users based on 24 abuse and dependence symptoms underlying standard DSM-IV criteria. Data came from a three site, population-based, epidemiological study to examine diagnostic nosology for Ecstasy use. Subject inclusion criteria included lifetime Ecstasy use exceeding five times and once in the past year, with participants ranging in age between 16 and 47 years of age from St. Louis, Miami, U.S. and Sydney, Australia. A satisfactory model typified four latent classes representing clearly differentiated diagnostic clusters including: (1) a group of sub-threshold users endorsing few abuse and dependence symptoms (negatives), (2) a group of 'diagnostic orphans' who had characteristic features of dependence for a select group of symptoms (mild dependent), (3) a 'transitional group' mimicking the orphans with regard to their profile of dependence also but reporting some abuse symptoms (moderate dependent), and (4) a 'severe dependent' group with a distinct profile of abuse and dependence symptoms. A multinomial logistic regression model indicated that certain latent classes showed unique associations with external non-diagnostic markers. Controlling for demographic characteristics and lifetime quantity of Ecstasy pill use, criminal behavior and motivational cues for Ecstasy use were the most efficient predictors of cluster membership. This study reinforces the heuristic utility of DSM-IV criteria applied to Ecstasy but with a different collage of symptoms that produced four distinct classes of Ecstasy users. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"1344","1","The Effects of Tryptamine Psychedelics in the Brain: A meta-Analysis of Functional and Review of Molecular Imaging Studies.^
There is an increasing interest in the neural effects of psychoactive drugs, in particular tryptamine psychedelics, which has been incremented by the proposal that they have potential therapeutic benefits, based on their molecular mimicry of serotonin. It is widely believed that they act mainly through 5HT2A receptors but their effects on neural activation of distinct brain systems are not fully understood. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of brain imaging studies to investigate the effects of substances within this class (e.g., LSD, Psilocybin, DMT, Ayahuasca) in the brain from a molecular and functional point of view. We investigated the question whether the changes in activation patterns and connectivity map into regions with larger 5HT1A/5HT2A receptor binding, as expected from indolaemine hallucinogens (in spite of the often reported emphasis only on 5HT2AR). We did indeed find that regions with changed connectivity and/or activation patterns match regions with high density of 5HT2A receptors, namely visual BA19, visual fusiform regions in BA37, dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and regions involved in theory of mind such as the surpramarginal gyrus, and temporal cortex (rich in 5HT1A receptors). However, we also found relevant patterns in other brain regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, many of the above-mentioned regions also have a significant density of both 5HT1A/5HT2A receptors, and available PET studies on the effects of psychedelics on receptor occupancy are still quite scarce, precluding a metanalytic approach. Finally, we found a robust neuromodulatory effect in the right amygdala. In sum, the available evidence points towards strong neuromodulatory effects of tryptamine psychedelics in key brain regions involved in mental imagery, theory of mind and affective regulation, pointing to potential therapeutic applications of this class of substances."
"3268","1","Investigating correlates of synthetic marijuana and Salvia use in light and intermittent smokers and college students in a predominantly Hispanic sample.^
Few studies have examined correlates related to the use of synthetic cannabinoids (e.g., Spice, K2) and Salvia divinorum. Two studies were conducted to investigate whether demographic, smoking-related, and substance-related variables were associated with the use of synthetic cannabinoids and Salvia. In Study 1, 185 participants (50% female; 83% Hispanic; Mage = 32 years; SD = 13.68) were recruited from a local health clinic and a university on the U.S./Mexico border for a smoking-cessation study targeting light and intermittent smokers. In Study 2, 675 participants (62.4% female; 89.1% Hispanic; Mage = 21.0, SD = 8.56) were recruited from a university on the U.S./Mexico border for an online study. In Study 1, 10% of the sample indicated they had ever used either synthetic cannabinoids or Salvia in their lifetime. Being male and dual/multiple use of tobacco products were significantly associated with having ever used synthetic cannabinoids or Salvia. In Study 2, 9%, 5%, and 3% of the sample indicated lifetime, past-year, and past 30-day use of synthetic cannabinoids, respectively. Five percent, 2%, and 1% of the sample indicated lifetime, past-year, and past 30-day use of Salvia, respectively. Logistic regression analyses revealed that past 30-day marijuana use and past 30-day ecstasy use were significantly associated with use of synthetic cannabinoids and Salvia in one's lifetime. These findings suggest that the assessment of synthetic marijuana and Salvia use is warranted in studies of other addictive behaviors, particularly among current marijuana and ecstasy users."
"6978","1","Effect of Psilocybin on Empathy and Moral Decision-Making.^
BACKGROUND: Impaired empathic abilities lead to severe negative social consequences and influence the development and treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, empathy has been shown to play a crucial role in moral and prosocial behavior. Although the serotonin system has been implicated in modulating empathy and moral behavior, the relative contribution of the various serotonin receptor subtypes is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the acute effect of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg p.o.) in healthy human subjects on different facets of empathy and hypothetical moral decision-making using the multifaceted empathy test (n=32) and the moral dilemma task (n=24). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased emotional, but not cognitive empathy compared with placebo, and the increase in implicit emotional empathy was significantly associated with psilocybin-induced changed meaning of percepts. In contrast, moral decision-making remained unaffected by psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behavior. Furthermore, together with previous findings, psilocybin appears to promote emotional empathy presumably via activation of serotonin 2A/1A receptors, suggesting that targeting serotonin 2A/1A receptors has implications for potential treatment of dysfunctional social cognition."
"8471","0","Using Psychedelics in Clinical Practice: Comparing Therapeutic Uses and Potential Harms.^
Psychedelics might be the oldest psychoactive agents known to be used for inducing religious or mystical experiences. Their strong psychoactive effect was discovered accidentally in 1943 after the synthesis of Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in 1937. These drugs became a mainstream area of research following the synthesis of LSD; however, several political and social factors led to their ban in 1966, after which research on psychedelics remained limited. These drugs became a major topic of scientific and ethical debate in the 1990's and the recent times have seen a 'Psychedelic renaissance' where the therapeutic value of psychedelics is being reconsidered. This article reports the historical perspective of psychedelics, pharmacologic action by 5-HT(2A) receptor agonism, and psychological effects and compares the proposed therapeutic uses, including uses in depression, PTSD, anxiety- related disorders, drug and alcohol addiction, neurodegenerative diseases, and auto-immune diseases to potential harms including the development of tolerance, hallucinogen persisting perception disorder, and potential psychosis. An analysis of history, pharmacology, and comparison of benefits and harms lead to the conclusion that the potential therapeutic benefits significantly outweigh the potential harms; thus, further research and clinical trials need to be conducted across different countries and cultures for their legal approval in clinical use."
"8249","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during response inhibition.^
INTRODUCTION: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Inhibitory deficits in the schizophrenia spectrum have been reliably reported using the antisaccade task. Interestingly, although similar antisaccade deficits have been reported following ketamine in non-human primates, ketamine-induced deficits have not been observed in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function during an antisaccade task, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on n = 15 healthy males. We measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and eye movements during a mixed antisaccade/prosaccade task while participants received a subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (target plasma level 100 ng/ml) on one occasion and placebo on the other occasion. RESULTS: While ketamine significantly increased self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences, it did not induce antisaccade or prosaccade performance deficits. At the level of BOLD, we observed an interaction between treatment and task condition in somatosensory cortex, suggesting recruitment of additional neural resources in the antisaccade condition under NMDAR blockage. DISCUSSION: Given the robust evidence of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia spectrum populations, the current findings suggest that ketamine may not mimic all features of psychosis at the dose used in this study. Our findings underline the importance of a more detailed research to further understand and define effects of NMDAR hypofunction on human brain function and behavior, with a view to applying ketamine administration as a model system of psychosis. Future studies with varying doses will be of importance in this context."

OBJECTIVE: To explore the effect of combined etomidate-ketamine anesthesia on perioperative electrocardiogram (ECG) and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD) of elderly patients with rheumatic heart valve disease (RHVD) undergoing heart valve replacement. METHODS: The data of 100 elderly RHVD patients treated in our hospital from May 2019 to May 2020 were selected for the retrospective analysis, and by adopting the double-blind method, the patients were divided into the ketamine group (n = 50) and the combined group (n = 50) according to the anesthesia methods. During the induction of anesthesia, the patients of the two groups were given a small dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) at 5 μg/kg/min continuously via pump injection until the end of surgery, and on this basis, with the same anesthesia measures, those in the combined group were given etomidate (0.3 mg/kg) additionally. The patients' perioperative ECG indicators, POCD scores, and Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) scores were compared between the two groups. RESULTS: Compared with the ketamine group, the combined group presented significantly lower incidence of ST-T wave changes after anesthesia induction and at the time of intubation and skin incision (P < 0.05), significantly lower average magnitude of ST-segment depression after anesthesia induction (P < 0.001), significantly lower average magnitude of ST-segment elevation after anesthesia induction and extubation (P < 0.001), significantly lower POCD incidence (6.%, P < 0.05), and significantly better NRS score after surgery (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: Combined etomidate-ketamine anesthesia can stabilize the perioperative ECG indicators of elderly RHVD patients undergoing heart valve replacement, improve their postoperative cognitive function, and reduce their pain sensation, which should be promoted and applied in practice."

The objective of this research was to test substance-related and non-substance-related psychiatric disorders as predictors of attempted suicide among adolescents. Ninety-six psychiatrically disordered suicide attempters were matched one-to-one to 96 psychiatrically disordered non-attempters on age, race, gender, and the presence/absence of major depression. Conditional logistic regression was used to test psychiatric risk factors for their power to predict attempted suicide among adolescents. Bipolar disorder, cocaine use disorders, and conduct disorder were found to be predictive of attempted suicide in univariate testing. Bipolar disorder, inhalant use disorders, cocaine use disorders, and hallucinogen use disorders were found to be predictive of attempted suicide, after adjusting for all other covariates. Loglinear analyses revealed high odds ratios associated with the comorbidities of alcohol use disorder with conduct disorder and drug use disorders with conduct disorder in both groups. Higher rates of cocaine use disorder/conduct disorder, hallucinogen use disorder/conduct disorder, and alcohol use disorder/ conduct disorder were found among suicide attempters. Evaluation of these particular comorbid conditions should be part of the adolescent suicide risk assessment."
"2026","1","Ketamine, lidocaine and combination for postoperative analgesia in liver resection: a randomized controlled trial.^
Introduction: Abdominal wall incisions used for liver surgeries are associated with significant postoperative pain and disability. Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for major abdominal surgery and is shown to have superior analgesia when compared to systemic analgesia[i]. However, its use is controversial[ii]. Lidocaine and ketamine both are being used for perioperative analgesia. Perioperative lidocaine infusion has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption[iii]. Perioperative low dose Ketamine has shown improved postoperative pain and reduced opioid usage[iv]. , therefore,re tested the hypothesis that the combination would provide better analgesia in the milieu of intrathecal morphine. Methods: After institutional ethics approval and written informed consent, we randomized 124 adult ASA 1‐4 patients scheduled for open liver resection to one of four groups. Intraoperatively, group L received lidocaine infusion, group K received ketamine infusion, group LK received lidocaine and ketamine infusion and group P received saline infusion. All patients received 300 mics intrathecal morphine prior to induction of standardized anesthesia and all infusions were started immediately after the intubation and continued until the end of surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received hydromorphone via a PCA device and its consumption recorded for 3 days. Data regarding other side effects was also recorded. Primary outcome measurements included pain scores and opioid consumption at 24 hrs. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and opioid consumption at 48 and 72 hrs and side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headaches and signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Data analysis included 113 patients. There was no difference in pain scores within all 4 groups at rest or movement at 24 hrs. Mean 48 hrs rest pain scores were 3.1, 1.7, 2.3 and 1.7 in L, K, KL and P groups respectively (p<0.03 between groups, unadjusted for multiple testing procedures). Pain scores were not significantly different at all other time points. All opioids were converted to morphine equivalents. Opioid use was less in ketamine group at 48 hrs but did not reach statistical significance. The total 72 hr use was not significantly different across the groups. There was no difference in side effects between the groups at any time points. Conclusions: In this triple blind, parallel group four‐arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trial, lidocaine, ketamine or their combination did not add any benefit over single dose intrathecal morphine with patient controlled hydromorphone analgesia. There was a trend towards better analgesia at 48 hrs with ketamine alone but reduction in opioid use was not significant."
"5594","0","Classical psychedelics as therapeutic agents in psychiatry. A review of the current state of clinical trials.^
Classical psychedelics, such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) or N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) are (partial) serotonin 5-HT2A agonists that acutely induce profound changes in perception, emotional processing and experiences, and consciousness. Classical psychedelics have already been used in western medicine as part of substance-assisted psychotherapy in the mid-20th century. They are now experiencing a renaissance with growing psychiatric and neuroscientific research. First modern clinical trials provide preliminary evidence for the safety and efficacy of classical psychedelics after one or very few doses in the treatment of different psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety disorders, substance use disorders and obsessive-compulsive disorder. While the existing evidence is promising, no valid conclusions on the efficacy of classical psychedelics can be drawn at this point as additional placebo-controlled, double-blinded clinical trials with larger samples are needed. It is clear that psychedelics, if they prove to be effective treatments after only one or few applications in larger clinical trials, will challenge well-established paradigms in psychiatry and psychopharmacotherapy."
"3111","1","Ketamine as a mental health treatment: Are acute psychoactive effects associated with outcomes? A systematic review.^
Esketamine was recently licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Drug Agency (EDA) for use in treatment resistant depression (TRD), and further research indicates ketamine as a possible treatment in other mental health conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesised that ketamine's acute psychoactive effects may be associated with psychiatric treatment efficacy. We systematically reviewed the evidence for this association. The databases Medline, Embase and Psychlnfo were searched up to June 2019. Studies were included if they enrolled adults with a psychiatric diagnosis, assessed acute psychoactive effects using a quantitative measure, and reported on the relationship between acute effects and treatment outcome. We included 21 studies, involving 891 patients. Seventeen studies assessed patients with depression (TRD [k = 14]), three assessed substance use disorders, and one assessed social anxiety disorder. Overall, 41 associations were assessed, of which 26 % were significant. The studies reviewed displayed great variability in terms of methodology and quality of reporting. The most commonly assessed effect was dissociation, measured by the CADSS. Our results suggest that the CADSS total is not consistently associated with antidepressant outcomes. Apart from this, the current literature is too limited to draw definite conclusions on the presence of an association between acute psychoactive effects and mental health outcomes. The field would benefit from consistently employing a priori hypotheses, more transparent reporting and sufficiently powered statistical analyses. Furthermore, the use of a broader range of assessments tools of acute psychoactive effects during ketamine administration would be beneficial."
"8483","1","Lack of effect of ketamine on cortical glutamate and glutamine in healthy volunteers: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.^
Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist that has been associated with temporary clinical improvement in patients with depression. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have shown that major depression is associated with decreased levels of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) in the anterior cingulate cortex, which normalize with clinical recovery. The present study aimed to test whether a ketamine infusion would increase cortical Glx levels in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers received an intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg kg⁻¹, n = 8) or saline (n = 9) over 40 minutes. MRS measurements were obtained at baseline, during, and at the end of the infusion. The infusion of ketamine had significant effects on mental state but there was no effect of ketamine on the levels of Glx (F (3,39) = 1.70, p = 0.18) or glutamate (F (3,39) = 48, p = 0.70). This study suggests that the gradual infusion of low-dose ketamine in antidepressant doses not cause changes in cortical glutamate or glutamine in healthy volunteers that are visible by proton MRS."
"2988","1","Low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) increase reward-related brain activity.^
Renewed interest in classic psychedelics as treatments for psychiatric disorders warrants a deeper understanding of their neural mechanisms. Single, high doses of psychedelic drugs have shown promise in treating depressive disorders, perhaps by reversing deficits in reward processing in the brain. In addition, there are anecdotal reports that repeated ingestion of low doses of LSD, or ""microdosing"", improve mood, cognition, and feelings of wellbeing. However, the effects of low doses of classic psychedelics on reward processing have not been studied. The current study examined the effects of two single, low doses of LSD compared to placebo on measures of reward processing. Eighteen healthy adults completed three sessions in which they received placebo (LSD-0), 13 μg LSD (LSD-13) and 26 μg LSD (LSD-26) in a within-subject, double-blind design. Neural activity was recorded while participants completed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. Event-related potentials were measured during feedback processing (Reward-Positivity: RewP, Feedback-P3: FB-P3, and Late-Positive Potential: LPP). Compared to placebo, LSD-13 increased RewP and LPP amplitudes for reward (vs. neutral) feedback, and LSD-13 and LSD-26 increased FB-P3 amplitudes for positive (vs. negative) feedback. These effects were unassociated with most subjective measures of drug effects. Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of depressive disorders."
"2630","0","Sex- and stress-dependent effects of a single injection of ketamine on open field and forced swim behavior.^
Ketamine has emerged as a novel treatment for common psychiatric conditions such as Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and anxiety disorders, many of which can be initiated and exacerbated by psychological stress. Sex differences in the frequency of both anxiety and depressive disorders are well known and could be due to sex differences in neuroendocrine responses to stress. Ketamine is known to modulate the hormonal response to stress, specifically corticosterone. It is not clear if the acute effect of ketamine on corticosterone differs by sex, or what role this could play in subsequent behavior. Here we test whether a single injection of (R,S)-ketamine (30 mg/kg, i.p.), administered either with or without unpredictable chronic stress (UCS), has different sustained effects on open field test (OFT), elevated zero maze (EZM) or forced swim test (FST) behavior in female versus male C57BL/6J mice. In the OFT (24 h post-injection), ketamine increased center square exploration in males but not females. In contrast, in the FST (72 h post-injection), females showed a trend toward a decrease in immobility after ketamine whereas males were not strongly modulated. These behavioral effects of ketamine were stronger in the presence of UCS than in unstressed animals. UCS animals also showed lower corticosterone after injection than unstressed animals, and in the presence of UCS ketamine increased corticosterone; these effects were similar in both sexes. Corticosterone post-injection did not predict subsequent behavior. These findings complement a growing preclinical literature suggesting both stress-dependency and sex differences in OFT and FST behavioral responses to ketamine.LAY SUMMARY In humans, it is known that major depression and anxiety disorders, which can be caused or made worse by exposure to psychological stress, occur roughly twice as frequently in women than in men, but the underpinnings of these effects are not well characterized. In the current study, we explored how sex interacts with stress and ketamine (a rapidly acting antidepressant) by assessing both open field and forced swim behavior in mice after chronic mild stress. We report the novel finding that male mice exhibit greater exploration of the aversive center square in the open field after ketamine, whereas females trended toward lower immobility (often interpreted as an antidepressant-like effect) in the forced swim test after this drug, and these effects were amplified by prior stress exposure."
"4339","0","Alcohol and other substance use after bariatric surgery: prospective evidence from a U.S. multicenter cohort study.^
BACKGROUND: Empirical evidence suggests Roux-en-Y gastric bypass (RYGB) increases risk of developing alcohol use disorder (AUD). However, prospective assessment of substance use disorders (SUD) after bariatric surgery is limited. OBJECTIVE: To report SUD-related outcomes after RYGB and laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding (LAGB). To identify factors associated with incident SUD-related outcomes. SETTING: 10 U.S. hospitals METHODS: The Longitudinal Assessment of Bariatric Surgery-2 is a prospective cohort study. Participants self-reported past-year AUD symptoms (determined by the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test), illicit drug use (cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, phencyclidine, amphetamines, or marijuana), and SUD treatment (counseling or hospitalization for alcohol or drugs) presurgery and annually postsurgery for up to 7 years through January 2015. RESULTS: Of 2348 participants who underwent RYGB or LAGB, 2003 completed baseline and follow-up assessments (79.2% women, baseline median age: 47 years, median body mass index 45.6). The year-5 cumulative incidence of postsurgery onset AUD symptoms, illicit drug use, and SUD treatment were 20.8% (95% confidence interval (CI): 18.5-23.3), 7.5% (95% CI: 6.1-9.1), and 3.5% (95% CI: 2.6-4.8), respectively, post-RYGB, and 11.3% (95% CI: 8.5-14.9), 4.9% (95% CI: 3.1-7.6), and .9% (95% CI: .4-2.5) post-LAGB. Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with higher risk of incident AUD symptoms (adjusted hazard ratio or AHR = 2.08 [95% CI: 1.51-2.85]), illicit drug use (AHR = 1.76 [95% CI: 1.07-2.90]) and SUD treatment (AHR = 3.56 [95% CI: 1.26-10.07]). CONCLUSIONS: Undergoing RYGB versus LAGB was associated with twice the risk of incident AUD symptoms. One-fifth of participants reported incident AUD symptoms within 5 years post-RYGB. AUD education, screening, evaluation, and treatment referral should be incorporated in pre- and postoperative care."
"969","0","Prohedonic properties of gamma-hydroxybutyrate are associated with changes in limbic resting-state functional connectivity.^
OBJECTIVE: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist and a narcolepsy treatment. However, GHB is also abused for its prohedonic effects. On a neuronal level, it was shown that GHB increases regional cerebral blood flow in limbic areas such as the right anterior insula (rAI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We aimed to further explore the association between the subjective and neuronal signatures of GHB. METHOD: We assessed subjective effects and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of an rAI- and an ACC-seed in 19 healthy male subjects after GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over functional magnet resonance imaging design. RESULTS: GHB increased subjective ratings for euphoria (p < 0.001) and sexual arousal (p < 0.01). Moreover, GHB increased rAI-rsFC to the right thalamus and the superior frontal gyrus and decreased ACC-rsFC to the bilateral paracentral lobule (all p < 0.05, cluster corrected). Moreover, GHB-induced euphoria was associated with rAI-rsFC to the superior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, uncorrected). CONCLUSIONS: GHB induces prohedonic effects such as euphoria and sexual arousal and in parallel modulates limbic rsFC with areas linked to regulation of mood, cognitive control, and sexual experience. These results further elucidate the drug's effects in neuropsychiatric disorders and as drug of abuse."
"8750","0","Performance and cognitive alterations.^
The aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the scientific research on the psychomotor and cognitive performance effects of commonly abused drugs. In an effort to encompass a wide range of psychomotor and cognitive functions, the following categories were selected: (1) sensory acuity, (2) motor ability, (3) attention, and (4) memory. Particular attention is focused on the effects of benzodiazepines, alcohol, opioids, and cannabis because of the relative breadth of research conducted on these compounds and because they are generally associated with cognitive decrements of potential clinical importance. The cognitive effects of psychomotor stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine), MDMA ('Ecstasy'), ketamine, and hallucinogens are also briefly reviewed. In the interest of clarity, and to retain this text's focus on evidence-based, clinically relevant research, emphasis is placed on acute drug effects measured in controlled laboratory studies with healthy human volunteers. These qualities in research minimize the likelihood of invalid assumptions and ambiguity associated with generalizing effects across species. Also, although research on the long-term cognitive effects associated with chronic drug use (i.e., observational group comparison studies of substance abusers versus matched control participants) can provide clinically relevant information, and is discussed in brief, conclusions based on such studies are limited because they usually lack assessments of baseline function and rely on retrospective self-reports of drug use that are subject to error and recall bias. Furthermore, because substance abusers typically have histories of using more than one drug, comorbid psychiatric disorders, or central nervous system injury, it is difficult to confidently attribute the cause of any observed cognitive deficits to use of a single drug. Last, by focusing on studies conducted with healthy (nondrug-dependent) participants, potential effects of drug withdrawal on baseline assessments are eliminated. In addition to providing an overview of published data on the cognitive effects of abused drugs, brief comment is made regarding the relative severity of the acute effects observed for each drug class. Because the impairment caused by alcohol is generally considered significant, alcohol is used as a benchmark to provide comparative comment regarding the magnitude and clinical importance of the cognitive deficits described for other less familiar drugs.

"1098","1","QEEG changes and psychotomimetic symptoms underlying the antidepressant response to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder.^
Background. Ketamine produces fast‐acting antidepressantlike effects, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In our study the time‐course of ketamine effect was assessed in depressive patients by QEEG to elucidate changes associated with treatment response. Methods. Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to assess the effect of single infusion of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) in 30 depressive inpatients. EEG data were analyzed 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after ketamine administration using sLORETA. Response was defined as ≥50% reduction of MADRS (Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale) score. Results. Ketamine induced an acute (10 and 30 minutes) decrease of parietooccipital alpha and an increase of gamma‐sources in all subjects. Eleven of 27 subjects who responded to medication (41%) were characterized by excess of mediofrontal delta/theta sources in comparison to nonresponders. Only the responders showed decreased fast activities in the left temporal lobe 1, 3, and 7 days after infusion, while no significant changes were observed in nonresponders. We found a significant correlation between the intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms during infusion and the alleviation of depressive symptoms at day 7. Conclusion. Our results suggest that an acute increase of theta/delta at mediofrontal sources may characterize response to ketamine. Antidepressant effect seems to be connected with each patient's psychotomimetic experience."
"3653","1","Gamma and delta neural oscillations and association with clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^
Several electrical neural oscillatory abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia, although the underlying mechanisms of these oscillatory problems are unclear. Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies."

"8976","1","Ketamine for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders: comprehensive systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: In the past two decades, subanaesthetic doses of ketamine have been demonstrated to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, and accumulating research has demonstrated ketamine's therapeutic effects for a range of psychiatric conditions. AIMS: In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. METHOD: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. RESULTS: We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further."
"8122","1","The antidepressant effect and safety of non-intranasal esketamine: A systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: The introduction of esketamine into the field of psychiatry comes on the heels of excitement from studies on racemic ketamine. While the intranasal route has been the most studied to date, other modes of administration of esketamine may also be of interest in the management of depression. AIMS: To systematically review the literature on non-intranasal esketamine for depression in terms of its antidepressant effect and safety. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception up to February 2021. Search terms included a combination of Medical Subject Headings and text words indicative of esketamine and depression. We selected both controlled and uncontrolled studies examining non-intranasal esketamine for the treatment of depression. RESULTS: We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on intravenous esketamine and 15 open-label studies on intravenous (n = 80), subcutaneous (n = 73), and oral (n = 5) esketamine. We found intravenous, subcutaneous, and possibly oral administration of esketamine to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in most patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and (severe) treatment-resistant depression. Clinical response to repeated administration of esketamine persisted over the course of treatment. Esketamine was well tolerated by most patients, but open-label data indicate marked psychotomimetic symptoms in exceptional cases. The overall quality of the controlled studies was considered high, the overall quality of the uncontrolled studies low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous, subcutaneous, and possibly oral esketamine may offer an effective and safe addition to the depression treatment armamentarium. However, as most included studies lacked a control group and had small sample sizes, the quality of our results is limited. Different types and formulations of ketamine remain to be compared directly."

Background: Major depression is a devastating common disorder. Current pharmacotherapy centers on noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation, but effect may require up to 21. Moreover, over a third of patients remain poorly unresponsive, termed Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Recently, intravenous Ketamine been shown to provide rapid amelioration of TRD, but patients were followed‐up for extremely short times. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a three week course of oral ketamine in outpatients with TRD. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial and 22 TRD patients received either oral ketamine or placebo as outpatients for 21 days. Patients were evaluated at pre‐trial, 230 minutes after drug administration, and at 21 days. The main outcome measure was the change in Montgomry Asberg Depression Rating Scale‐ (MADRS) score. Results: 12 subjects were randomized to the ketamine group, and 10 to the placebo group. Four patients from the placebo group opted out due to treatment ineffectiveness. A repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (F(1,16)=15.12, p=.001) together with a significant interaction between group an time (F(1,16)=7.58, p=.014). Tukey Honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc comparisons revealed a significant reduction in depression after 21 days in the ketamine group only (p=.0003). Conclusions: In this study, oral ketamine in a sub‐anesthetic dose caused a rapid amelioration of depressive symptoms in ambulatory TRD patients, and was well tolerated. The results of this study suggest that oral ketamine may hold significant promise in the care of outpatients with treatment resistant major depression."

A resurgence of research has begun to systematically examine the relationship between psychedelic use and mental health and well-being. Although preliminary findings examining the therapeutic value of these substances show promise, the mechanisms through which psychedelic use may predict reduced mental distress remain poorly understood. To this end, we surveyed a community sample of individuals (n = 159) who endorsed lifetime psychedelic use to examine relationships among psychedelic use and self-reported spirituality, difficulties in emotion regulation, and symptoms of mental health issues. Results revealed a pathway through which classic psychedelic use predicted greater spirituality, which in turn predicted better emotion regulation, ultimately predicting lower levels of anxiety, depressed mood, and disordered eating. These results contribute to our understanding of potential mechanisms of change with respect to psychedelics and mental health. They also add to the growing body of literature pointing to the healing effects of the cultivation of spirituality and emotion regulation as separate and related constructs."

Aims. To describe the patterns of drug use at dance (rave) events in terms of prevalence, frequency, type of drugs used, patterns of use, access and risk-associated behaviours. Design. Self-selecting participant-completed survey. Setting. Three dance events in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Participants. One hundred and twenty-two drug users (57% males, 43% females), 90% of whom were in employment or education, with an age range of 16-47, 80% between 18 and 23 years. Measurements. Participants who answered ""yes"" to the question ""Have you used drugs for dance events in the past year"" reported (i) the prevalence, types and frequency of drugs used; (ii) prevalence and contents of mixing drugs; (iii) accessing drugs; and (iv) engagement with drug-associated risk behaviours. Findings. Over 80% of the participants had used ecstasy and amphetamine, over 30% cocaine and LSD; over 10% nitrites, psilocybin and ketamine and less than 5% had used crack or tranquillizers. Participants reported regular consumption of ecstasy and amphetamine (e.g. 35% used ecstasy and 25% amphetamine on a weekly basis) often taken in combination, with the occasional use of cocaine, LSD, ketamine and psilocybin. Poly- and mixing-drug behaviours were significantly more likely than monodrug usage. Drugs were accessed through friends than from any other source. Eighty-five per cent reported mixing drugs and/or alcohol, 35% driving on drugs, 36% having a bad experience on drugs; 30% unprotected sex; and 0.9% injecting drugs. Women in the sample reported higher consumption than men. Conclusions. Dance-drug use has a characteristic pattern that has implications for health promotion and criminal policy."
"1846","1","Self-reported psychopathological symptoms in recreational ecstasy (MDMA) are mainly associated with regular cannabis use: Further evidence from a combined cross-sectional/longitudinal investigation.^
Rationale: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) has become a widely used recreational drug among young people. This is of great concern, since MDMA is neurotoxic in animal studies and its use has been associated with psychological distress and a variety of self-reported psychiatric symptoms. However, exploring the origins of psychopathology in ecstasy users is hampered by the frequent polydrug use and by the cross-sectional design of all investigations, so far. Objectives: The present study combines a cross-sectional with a longitudinal approach to further clarify the impact of the use of other illicit drugs on psychopathological symptoms reported by ecstasy users. Methods: At baseline, we administered self-rating scales for impulsivity, sensation seeking and general psychological complaints to 60 recreational ecstasy users and 30 matched controls. From the initial sample of ecstasy users, 38 subjects were reexamined 18 months later. Results: At baseline, ecstasy users reported significantly more psychological complaints than controls. However, self-reported psychopathology was mainly associated with regular cannabis use. At follow-up, subjects who had abstained from ecstasy use during the follow-up period did not differ from those reporting continued consumption. In contrast, subjects with regular concomitant cannabis use during the follow-up period reported more anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive behaviour than cannabis-abstinent users. Finally, higher levels of obsessive-compulsive behaviour, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety and paranoid ideation were significantly correlated with the duration of regular interim cannabis use. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that self-reported psychopathology in ecstasy users is predominantly attributable to concomitant use of cannabis. Abstinence from cannabis and not ecstasy seems to be a reliable predictor for remission of psychological complaints in ecstasy users. © Springer-Verlag 2004."

An up to date review of drug treatment in psychoses of early childhood is presented. At the present time, of all biological interventions in these developmental disorders, drug treatment alone remains a valuable addition or an essential treatment modality of the total treatment. Experience has shown that a therapeutically effective potent drug can make the autistic child more amenable to other therapies, including special education. However, knowledge is lacking about the effect of various psychoactive agents on cognition in this patient population as well as their influence on growth, weight, endocrine systems, and organs. Drugs currently in use treat symptoms, not diseases. A great need for classification in this area persists. The same symptoms may be caused by a variety of etiologic factors, and autism may or may not be the earliest expression of childhood schizophrenia. It is suggested that clinical distinctions be correlated or even improved by certain biochemical, neuroendocrine, and physiological criteria; this also may be of considerable value in predicting whether a child can benefit from a specific drug."

Socio-demographic information form, Model Europe Survey and Acculturation Attitudes Scale were used as study instruments. 2018 data were compared with 2003, 2008, 2013, 2015 and 2017 studies in which the same survey and method were used. Results: Five hundred and forty five participants were male and 519 female. Also, 33.6% of the participants were between the ages of 18–29, 58% of participants were born in Cyprus, 38.2% were university graduate or above and 48.2% of the participants were living with their spouses. According to the study, the prevalence of cigarette usage at least once in a lifetime was 64.9%, alcohol 74.5%, other psychoactive substance (OPS) 11.4% and illicit substance (IS) 9.0%. Being under 25 years of age, Turkey-born, not religious, using alcohol and cigarettes and experiencing drunkenness constituted the risk factors of IS users. Marginalization scores were lower both for drug users born in Turkey and NC. Discussion: It was observed that both OPS and IS usage have increased in the last 15 years. Cannabis, synthetic cannabinoid and ecstasy are more widely used. It was also observed that OPS is more used among those who cannot create a marginal response to acculturation stress. In prevention programs and treatments, sociocultural characteristics should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"3612","0","Safety and Efficacy of Medical Cannabis in Autism Spectrum Disorder Compared with Commonly Used Medications.^
Objective: The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of medications commonly used in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and compare this to what current research has shown regarding medical cannabis use in this population. Methods: Searches were performed to collect information surrounding currently used medications and their safety and efficacy profiles, biologic plausibility of cannabis use for symptoms of ASD, and studies detailing cannabis' safety and efficacy profile for use in the ASD population. Results were used to compare medications to cannabis as a proposed treatment. Results: The heterogeneity of ASD produces great difficulties in finding appropriate treatment, leading to many medication changes or treatment trials throughout a patient's life. Commonly prescribed medications display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability between patients and symptoms targeted. Some of the most common side effects cited are also considered the most troubling symptoms associated with ASD; aggression, anxiety, irritability, and a negative effect on cognition, leading many patients to discontinue use as the side effects outweigh benefits. Recent case reports and retrospective studies have displayed the potential efficacy, safety, and tolerability of cannabidiol (CBD)-rich medical cannabis use for treating both core symptoms of ASD and many comorbid symptoms such as irritability and sleep problems. Studies have also identified circulating endocannabinoids as a possible biomarker for ASD, providing another possible method of diagnosis. Conclusions: Currently, there are no approved medications for the core symptoms of ASD and only two medications Food and Drug Administration approved for associated irritability. Prescribed medications for symptoms associated with ASD display varying levels of efficacy, safety, and tolerability among the heterogeneous ASD population. At the time of this study there are no published placebo-controlled trials of medical cannabis for ASD and the observational studies have limitations. CBD-rich medical cannabis seems to be an effective, tolerable, and relatively safe option for many symptoms associated with ASD, however, the long-term safety is unknown at this time."
"9589","1","Predictors of response to repeated ketamine infusions in depression with suicidal ideation: An ROC curve analysis.^
Background: Ketamine has rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal properties, while a proportion of patients do not adequately achieve a complete response to ketamine. Our aim was to explore the applicability of using clinical factors and serum tryptophan (TRP) metabolites to predict the response to six doses of ketamine for depression with suicidal ideation. Methods: Seventy-three depressed patients with suicidal ideation received a thrice-weekly infusion regimen of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine. Clinical symptoms were assessed by the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9), and serum levels of TRP, kynurenine (KYN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA) were detected by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry at baseline and day 1 (1 day after the first infusion). The potential predictors of response was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analyses. Results: The area under the curve (AUC = 0.959) implied a good accuracy of the combination of early clinical response and day 1 KYN and KYNA levels as a predictor of acute antidepressant response. The combination of early clinical response and day 1 KYNA levels showed moderate discrimination of acute antisuicidal response with an AUC of 0.825 and short-term antidepressant response with an AUC of 0.813. Limitations: The patients continued receiving previous medications during ketamine treatment, which may have impacted the TRP metabolites. Conclusion: The combination of early clinical response and TRP metabolites at the early stage of repeated ketamine treatment could be considered an eligible predictor for acute- and short-term response for treating depression with suicidal ideation.

"6432","1","Ecstasy use and its association with sexual behaviors among drug users in New York City.^
In the past two decades, recreational use of ecstasy has become a growing concern in the United States, although most studies assessing ecstasy use have focused on white, middle-class adolescents who use ecstasy during raves and in clubs. We assessed the prevalence of recent ecstasy use among predominantly minority heroin, cocaine, and crack users in New York City and the association between ecstasy and sexual risk above and beyond that of the other drugs. Between 2002 and 2004, injection and non-injection heroin, crack and cocaine users (N = 534) completed a risk behavior questionnaire that included items on ecstasy use. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relation between current ecstasy use and sexual behaviors. Of 534 illicit drug users, 69.7% were aged 25 years or older, 65.2% were Hispanic, 27.9% Black and 77.4% male; 36.7% were injectors. 17.2% of respondents reported recent (last six months) ecstasy use. In a multivariable logistic regression model, current ecstasy use was associated both with initiating sex before age 14 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.51) and having two or more partners in the past two months (AOR = 1.86) after adjusting for age at study entry, current cocaine and marijuana use and being an injection drug user. This study suggests that ecstasy use may be more prevalent among urban drug users. Ecstasy use in urban settings, beyond clubs and raves, should continue to be monitored. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."
"8287","1","Evaluation of clinical factors associated with adverse drug events in patients receiving sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions.^
Introduction: Sub-anesthetic ketamine is frequently used as an analgesic to reduce perioperative opioid consumption and has also been shown to have antidepressant effects. Side effects of ketamine include dizziness, diplopia, nystagmus, and psychomimetic effects. It is unclear what clinical factors may be associated with ketamine-related adverse drug events (ADEs). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 95 patients who received sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions at our institution. Data examined associations between ketamine-related ADEs and various clinical characteristics including chronic pain, depression, or psychiatric disorder, patient physical characteristics, chronic opioid use, perioperative opioid use, dose and duration of ketamine infusions, pain scores, and perioperative medications such as serotonergic agents, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and analgesics. Results: Overall incidence of ketamine-related ADEs was 29.5% and the incidence of psychomimetic effects was 14.8%. We observed that patients with a history of depression have a lower incidence of ketamine-related ADEs compared to patients without a history of depression (10.3% vs 37.3%; p value = 0.007). Conclusion: Patients with depression were found to have a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ketamine-related ADEs. We found no statistically significant positive associations between ketamine-related ADEs and other clinical factors such as a history of chronic pain, psychiatric disease, patient physical characteristics, perioperative opioid use, dose of ketamine infusion, or co-administration of other CNS depressants."

Mindfulness-based interventions and psychedelic-assisted therapy have been experimentally utilised in recent years as alternative treatments for various psychopathologies with moderate to great success. Both have also demonstrated significant post-acute and long-term decreases in clinical symptoms and enhancements in well-being in healthy participants. These two therapeutic interventions share various postulated salutogenic mechanisms, such as the ability to alter present-moment awareness and anti-depressive action, via corresponding neuromodulatory effects. Recent preliminary evidence has also demonstrated that psychedelic administration can enhance mindfulness capacities which has already been demonstrated robustly as a result of mindfulness-based interventions. These shared mechanisms between mindfulness-based interventions and psychedelic therapy have led to scientists theorising, and recently demonstrating, synergistic effects when both are used in combination, in the form of potentiated therapeutic benefit. These synergistic results hold great promise but require replication in bigger sample groups and better controlled methodologies, to fully delineate the effect of set and setting, before they can be extended onto clinical populations."
"730","0","Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a commonly used anaesthetic agent, and in subanaesthetic doses is also given as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of cancer pain, particularly when opioids alone prove to be ineffective. Ketamine is known to have hallucinogenic side effects. To date no systematic review of the benefits and harms of adjuvant ketamine for cancer pain has been undertaken. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of cancer pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), CancerLit (1966-2001), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2001); by handsearching reference lists from review articles, trials, and chapters from standard textbooks on pain and palliative care. The manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer Parke-Davis) provided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of adult patients with cancer and pain being treated with an opioid, and receiving either ketamine (any dose and any route of administration) or placebo or an active control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers identified four RCTs for possible inclusion in the review, and 32 case studies/case series reports. Quality and validity assessment was performed by three independent reviewers, and two RCTs were excluded because of inappropriate study design. Patient reported pain intensity and pain relief was assessed using visual analog scales, verbal rating scales or other validated scales, and adverse effects data were collated. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were eligible for inclusion in the review and both concluded that ketamine improves the effectiveness of morphine in the treatment of cancer pain. However, pooling of the data was not appropriate because of the small total number of patients (30), and the presence of clinical heterogeneity. Some patients experienced hallucinations on both ketamine plus morphine and morphine alone and were treated successfully with diazepam. No other serious adverse effects were reported. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of cancer pain. More randomized controlled trials are needed."
"3995","1","Effects of S-ketamine as an anesthetic adjuvant to propofol on treatment response to electroconvulsive therapy in treatment-resistant depression: a randomized pilot study.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) anesthesia has been reported to be associated with better seizure quality and longer duration compared with methohexital anesthesia. Furthermore, ketamine may enhance the efficacy of ECT while having rapid independent antidepressant properties itself. However, data on the effects of ketamine with ECT are inconsistent, and there are no reports of S-ketamine. The aim of the present pilot study was to explore the effects of S-ketamine as an adjuvant to propofol on the efficacy, seizure duration, and quality of electroencephalography in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Thirty-two patients with a recurrent severe or psychotic major depressive disorder with treatment resistance to antidepressants were included in the study. For induction of anesthesia, the patients were randomized into 2 study groups. The S-ketamine group first received S-ketamine (0.4 mg/kg) as a bolus and then propofol. The treatment-as-usual group first received saline and then propofol. RESULTS: A statistically significant and clinically relevant reduction in the depression symptom scores was found in both study groups during ECT. There was no difference in the magnitude or speed of response between the study groups, nor was there any difference in the numbers of ECT treatments, seizure thresholds, seizure durations, and the electrical doses either. The patients recovered from anesthesia equally, but the degree of posttreatment disorientation and restlessness was more marked in the S-ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, a subanesthetic adjuvant dose of S-ketamine with propofol may not increase the effects of ECT in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, S-ketamine was associated with increased posttreatment disorientation and restlessness."
"5361","0","Investigating how individual differences in selective attention relate to schizotypy and altered states of consciousness.^
Measures of altered states of consciousness (ASC) are useful for understanding anomalies within conscious experiences. Within psychedelic clinical trials, ASC have been associated with long-term positive treatment outcomes for numerous types of mental illnesses. Schizotypal Personality Scale (STA), a set of personality traits that can be related to psychedelic-induced ASC, is associated with potential changes in selective attention, such as being less bound to previously learned associations (i.e., reduced associative blocking). Given the similarity between schizotypy and psychedelic-induced ASC, we hypothesized that there may be attentional differences in individuals with past experiences of ASC. This study examined how differences in selective attention relate to past experiences of ASC and STA. In Study 1, participants completed a visual categorization task designed to elicit associative blocking, the STA, and the ASC scale. Results revealed slow learning feature–category associations in participants high in ASC and STA. Study 2 tested whether this deficit in performance was due to widened attention by implementing additional inference trials that measured incidental learning of feature–feature associations. Results from Study 2 confirmed that participants high in ASC and STA show deficits in learning categories, but this was not accounted for by wider selective attention per se. Our results suggest that flexible or widened attention may not be the locus of cognitive changes associated with past experiences of ASC. Rather, by showing reliable latency in an error-driven learning task, we add to a comprehensive understanding of the relationships between cognition and ASC.

"2694","0","Sensory gating in tobacco-naïve cannabis users is unaffected by acute nicotine administration.^
OBJECTIVES: Long-term cannabis use has been associated with the appearance of psychotic symptoms and schizophrenia-like cognitive impairments; however these studies may be confounded by concomitant use of tobacco by cannabis users. We aimed to determine if previously observed cannabis-associated deficits in sensory gating would be seen in cannabis users with no history of tobacco use, as evidenced by changes in the P50, N100, and P200 event-related potentials. A secondary objective of this study was to examine the effects of acute nicotine administration on cannabis users with no tobacco use history. METHODS: Three components (P50, N100, P200) of the mid-latency auditory-evoked response (MLAER) were elicited by a paired-stimulus paradigm in 43 healthy, non-tobacco smoking male volunteers between the ages of 18-30. Cannabis users (CU, n = 20) were administered nicotine (6 mg) and placebo gum within a randomized, double-blind design. Non-cannabis users (NU, n = 23) did not receive nicotine. RESULTS: Between-group sensory gating effects were only observed for the N100, with CUs exhibiting a smaller N100 to S(1) of the paired stimulus paradigm, in addition to reduced dN100 (indicating poorer gating). Results revealed no significant sensory gating differences with acute administration of nicotine compared to placebo cannabis conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a relationship between gating impairment and cannabis use; however, acute nicotine administration nicotine does not appear to impact sensory gating function."

This study aims to estimate changes in the prevalence of ecstasy use over time, analyze the overlap of ecstasy use and other drug use, and compare other drug use in ecstasy versus marijuana users. The authors hypothesized that ecstasy users early in the ""epidemic"" would be polydrug users and that associations between ecstasy and other drug use would diminish as the prevalence of ecstasy use increased. Data were drawn from public use data files from the 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Ecstasy use increased in the U.S. population and the prevalence was greater in younger age groups. Ecstasy users were likely to use a variety of other drugs; however, association of ecstasy use with other drug use was strongest early in the ""epidemic,"" diminishing as the number of new users increased. Later, more drug-naive adolescents and young adults began experimenting with ecstasy. These results can orient prevention strategies that target ecstasy users.

Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become one of the most common psychiatric diagnosis in the United States specifically within the veteran population. The current treatment options for this debilitating diagnosis include trauma-focused psychotherapies along with selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI).(1) MDMA has recently been shown as a novel therapeutic agent with promisingly results in the treatment of PTSD. MDMA is a psychoactive compound traditionally categorized as a psychedelic amphetamine that deemed a Schedule I controlled substance in the 1980s. Prior to its status as a controlled substance, it was used by psychotherapists for an array of psychiatric issues. In more recent times, MDMA has resurfaced as a potential therapy for PTSD and the data produced from randomized, controlled trials back the desire for MDMA to be utilized as an effective pharmacologic therapy in conjunction with psychotherapy.(2)."

Objectives: To evaluate the prevalence of substance use among high school students and to examine the relationship between substance use and violence and psychological features. Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 23 high schools in Hatay in 2006 using a questionnaire consisted of General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: A total of 1629 students were given study questionnaire. Lifetime substance use prevalence was 38.8 for cigarette smoking, 30.5 for alcohol use, 30.1 for being drunk, 13.9 for regular smoking, 7.1 for volatile substance use, 1.1 for marijuana use, 0.8 for drug use such as heroin, ecstasy, and cocaine. Anxiety scores were higher in smokers while self esteem and self efficacy scores were higher in alcohol users. Exposure to physical violence and use of physical violence within the last year were higher in smokers and in all substance users. Conclusion: Cigarette, alcohol and volatile substances were frequently used among adolescents. The results show that high anxiety is related with smoking, high self esteem and self efficacy are related with alcohol use. Substance use is associated with exposure to and use of violence. © Medical Journal of Trakya University. Published by Ekin Medical Publishing. All rights reserved."
"5641","1","A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^
Depression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

Little is known about psychoactive substance use in students, apart from tobacco, alcohol, and cannabis. This study investigated the prevalence of substance use and overlap between various psychoactive substances in students. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 10 066 students included in the i-Share cohort between January 1, 2015, and December 31, 2017. The baseline questionnaire was the key source of information. Psychoactive substances of interest (PSI) were cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, nitrous oxide, poppers, and MDMA. Their patterns of use were categorized as lifetime, past year, and current use. The use of other psychoactive substances including alcohol and tobacco was described in PSI users and non-users. Most participants were female (75%), and their average age was 21 years. Lifetime use of at least one PSI was reported by 65.5% of participants. Cannabis was the most frequently used substance both over lifetime (57% of students) and past year (35%), followed by poppers and nitrous oxide (28% and 26% of students over lifetime, respectively). Among polydrug users (n = 1242), 65% used only nitrous oxide and poppers, showing a strong link between these two substances. Regular alcohol use, binge drinking, and current tobacco use were higher in PSI users than in non-users. Substance use was higher than previously found in both French and European studies in young people. Nitrous oxide use was particularly high. Regular alcohol use, binge drinking, and tobacco use could be used as markers to identify students at risk of PSI use to be targeted by prevention programs."

Introduction: In March 2019, intranasal esketamine was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in adults. This review presents the results of clinical trials underlying the FDA approval of intranasal esketamine.Areas covered: Esketamine's efficacy and safety in TRD were assessed in 5 phase III studies: three 4-week, placebo-controlled studies, and two long-term trials. One short-term trial showed statistically significant antidepressant effects of esketamine vs placebo, while a long-term withdrawal study showed that esketamine is significantly beneficial in terms of extending time to relapse, compared to placebo. Two other short-term trials did not meet the prespecified statistical tests for showing efficacy, although improvement in depressive symptoms from baseline to the end of week 4 favors esketamine over placebo.Expert opinion: Intranasal esketamine is a new treatment option for people with TRD. The main benefit of esketamine is rapid onset of antidepressant activity, but the effects of prolonged treatment are still preliminary. The main concerns relate to the safety aspects of prolonged esketamine therapy, when considering its abuse potential. While data for esketamine use over a long period of time is lacking, its use should be carefully monitored."
"9114","1","Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.^
Abstract: Rationale: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. Objectives: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. Method: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. Results: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. Conclusions: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
"6798","0","Movement Dysfunction as a Neuropathology of Illicit Stimulant Abuse.^
The widespread and increasing use of illicit stimulants is a global problem. There is evidence that these drugs exert long-term effects on dopaminergic (methamphetamine, cocaine) and serotonergic (ecstasy) systems and therefore have the potential to adversely affect movement. In addition, methamphetamine produces structural changes in the substantia nigra that have been associated with significantly increased risk of Parkinson's disease. Studies of movement in abstinent stimulant users show abnormalities including impaired performance on the grooved pegboard test of hand function, reduced maximal speed of finger movement, and, in abstinent ecstasy users, an increase in tremor during movement. Case studies suggest that clinical manifestations of stimulant-induced movement abnormalities may include chorea, tics, and parkinsonian symptoms. For methamphetamine, there is evidence from epidemiological studies that the risk of Parkinson's disease is increased approximately twofold in former users of the drug. With the future increase in the number of former stimulant users in the population, there is potential for significant increases in the prevalence of movement disorders. © 2016 Elsevier Inc.

Objectives: Decreasing serotonergic neurotransmission in humans has been found to impair memory consolidation. Such effects may be relevant to the memory deficits seen in major depression and the cognitive actions of antidepressant drugs used to treat them. However, the improvement in cognitive function often found following successful pharmacological treatment in depression may be confounded by symptom improvement. Rationale: The present study assessed the effects of an acute challenge with the selective serotonergic re-uptake inhibitor citalopram in healthy (non-depressed) females. Methods: Immediate and delayed recall/recognition was assessed using the auditory verbal learning test following 10 mg (intravenous) citalopram. or placebo in a double-blind between groups design. Results: Immediate recall on the verbal memory test was unaffected by citalopram administration. However, volunteers receiving citalopram showed enhanced long-term memory performance in terms of delayed recall and recognition relative to those receiving placebo. Sustained attention performance was also comparable in the two groups of subjects suggesting that non-specific increases in information processing are not responsible for this effect. Conclusions: These results indicate that augmentation of serotonergic neurotransmission is associated with increased memory consolidation, which may be relevant to its therapeutic and cognitive actions in acutely depressed patients."

The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine leads to transient psychosis-like symptoms and impairments in oculomotor performance in healthy volunteers. This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS) and antisaccades (AS) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups (intravenous 100 ng ml(-1) ketamine, 2 mg oral risperidone, 100  ng ml(-1) ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone, placebo). Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events. Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P < 0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P > or = 0.07). An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P < or = 0.04). No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found (all P > or = 0.26). The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia."

INTRODUCTION: There is an imminent need for faster-acting and more effective antidepressants beyond the monoaminergic hypothesis. METHODS: We systematically searched the US Clinical Trials registry for antidepressant compounds with completed phase II and III trials. Compounds that demonstrated significant superiority over placebo in the primary outcome measure in the latest phase of phase II and III trials were identified. The collateral information was gathered via a PubMed search and press releases. RESULTS: Nine compounds were identified. AXS-05 (a combination of dextromethorphan and bupropion) and ansofaxine hydrochloride showed a positive result over placebo in a phase III study for major depressive disorder or treatment-resistant depression. MIJ821, nitrous oxide, psilocybin, ayahuasca, facial injection of botulinum toxin A, prasterone, and casopitant demonstrated at least one positive result in phase II trials. Ayahuasca showed a greater response rate than placebo at week one, indicating the rapid antidepressant effect. DISCUSSION: These new compounds with novel mechanisms of action are expected to provide a greater variety of treatment options for depression if preliminary positive results are confirmed."
"3681","1","An investigation into the sub-acute effects of ecstasy on aggressive interpretative bias and aggressive mood - are there gender differences?.^
The lowering of serotonin for a period following MDMA use could account for the increases in both self-rated and objective measures of aggression previously found in ecstasy users several days after taking the drug. There is some evidence of gender differences in the acute, sub-acute and long-term effects of MDMA use, and given that gender differences have been found in aggression, it is possible that men may experience more aggression mid-week than women. The aim of this study was to attempt to replicate findings showing increased bias towards aggressive material in ecstasy users several days after using the drug. In addition, to investigate possible gender differences in mid-week aggression. A total of 46 participants were tested: 19 ecstasy users and 27 controls were compared on the night of drug use and 4 days later. On day 4, a task designed to tap cognitive bias toward material with aggressive content was administered. Participants were required to process sentences that could be interpreted as either aggressive or neutral and subsequently remember them in a recognition test. This data set was then combined with the data from Curran et al.'s (2004) study that employed exactly the same procedure. Thus, the data from 107 participants was analysed to investigate gender differences. Ecstasy users recognized more aggressive sentences than controls and tended to react slower to neutral sentences than controls. Ecstasy users also rated themselves as being more aggressive and depressed than controls on day 4. No gender differences were found on any measure of aggression in the combined data set. Both male and female ecstasy users show a bias toward interpretation of ambiguous material in an aggressive manner when compared to controls 4 days after ecstasy use."
"809","1","Long-Term Efficacy of Combination Therapy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Ketamine for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). METHODS: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2‐4.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10‐30 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up. RESULTS: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test (a=0.01, t=22.81, p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."
"6953","1","Determination of MDMA and its metabolites in blood and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and analysis of enantiomers by capillary electrophoresis.^
A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used for the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) metabolites in plasma and urine samples after the administration of 100 mg MDMA to healthy volunteers. Samples were hydrolyzed prior to a solid-phase extraction with Bond Elut Certify columns. Analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate (2% ammonium hydroxide) and analyzed as their trifluoroacyl derivatives. Linear calibration curves were obtained at plasma and urine concentration ranges of 25-400 ng/mL and 250-2000 ng/mL for MDMA and HMMA, and of 2.5-40 ng/mL and 100-1000 ng/mL for MDA and HMA. Following the same urine preparation procedure but without the derivatization step, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for enantiomerical resolution of compounds was developed using (2-hydroxy)propyl-beta-cyclodextrin at two different concentrations (10 and 50mM in 50mM H3PO4, pH 2.5) as chiral selector. Calibration curves for the CE method were prepared with the corresponding racemic mixture and were linear between 125 and 2000 ng/mL, 50 and 1000 ng/mL, and 125 and 1500 ng/mL for each enantiomer of MDMA, MDA, and HMMA, respectively. Stereoselective disposition of MDMA and MDA was confirmed. HMMA disposition seems to be in apparent contradiction with MDMA findings as the enantiomer ratio is close to 1 and constant over the time."
"4042","0","[The use of psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression].^
The hallucinogen psilocybin is a potential novel treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Our goal is to review current knowledge on psilocybin and its efficacy in TRD. Literature searches were done on PubMed, Web of Science and Google Scholar, references reviewed in identified articles and other articles found on the website of COMPASS Pathways. Psilocybin treatment consists usually of a single oral administration of 25 mg of psilocybin along with psychological support for 5-8 hours during the ensuing hallucinogenic trip. Common side-effects include headache, nausea, fatigue and insomnia. A systematic review has demonstrated significant antidepressant efficacy in certain groups and a double-blind randomized study found antidepressant efficacy of psilocybin comparable to the SSRI escitalopram. In the phase 2 study of COMPASS Pathways, the psilocybin-COMP360 treatment led to a rapid response and remission as early as three weeks following the treatment for around one third of participants. Recent studies have shown that psilocybin significantly decreases the severity of depressive symptoms and is generally well tolerated. Further research will reveal whether it will be granted a license to treat treatment-resistant depression in the near future. There remains an urgent need for novel treatments for those who do not respond to current antidepressant therapies."
"6107","0","Electrophysiological Biomarkers of AV-101.^
Background: Suicide is the 10th leading cause of death in the US, and is 2‐7 times higher in Veterans than age‐ and sex‐matched civilians. Standard psychiatric medications (such as lithium) are anti‐suicidal with prolonged use only, and do not impact acute suicidality. A priority for suicide prevention is to define novel treatment targets for safe and rapidly‐acting interventions. Recent studies have associated suicide and medically severe suicide attempt (MSSA) with dysregulation of the brain kynurenine pathway (KP), which could predispose to excessive NMDAR activation, a molecular target purportedly involved in rapid improvement of suicidality with agents such as ketamine. AV‐101 (4‐chlorokynurenine, 4‐Cl‐KYN) is an oral pro‐drug that targets KP dysregulation with downstream NMDAR deactivation. Phase‐1 testing showed that AV‐101 is metabolized to 7‐Cl‐KYN in 1.5 to 2 hours after intake. Objective: Before testing possible anti‐suicidal properties, biomarkers need to be defined to show that AV‐101 engages the NMDAR. The objective of the current study is to define valid and sensitive neurophysiological markers with a dose‐response relationship with AV‐101 as evidence of NMDAR engagement, as well as study safety and tolerability. Methods: The investigators will recruit 12 healthy and non‐psychiatrically ill OEF/OIF/OND Veterans (age 25‐64) who will receive two single doses of AV‐101 (720 mg, 1440 mg) and placebo in a randomized, double‐blind, crossover design with one week wash‐out between conditions. Neurophysiological measures collected at baseline (pre‐treatment) and hourly for 5 hours following medication intake are resting state EEG, Mismatch Negativity amplitude, and P50 sensory gating, measures sensitive to modulation of different NMDAR mechanisms. Repeated measures General Linear Models will be used to test dose‐response relationships."
"5925","1","Overcoming blinding confounds in psychedelic randomized controlled trials using biomarker driven causal mediation analysis.^
INTRODUCTION: There is great interest in the use of psychedelic-assisted therapies to treat a range of mental health conditions and initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generated positive results. However, the effect sizes reported in psychedelic RCTs are likely inflated due to expectancy effects due to the de-blinding of both participants and study personnel to treatment allocation caused by the distinctive psychoactive effects of psychedelic drugs. AREAS COVERED: An introduction to causal inference for RCTs, the underlying assumptions, and potential confounders along with graphical illustrations is provided. It is proposed that causal mediation analysis using objectively measured mediating biomarkers could be used to identify causal pathways between treatment and outcome in psychedelic RCTs, even with de-blinding of participants and give greater confidence as to the mechanistic basis and efficacy of psychedelic therapies. EXPERT OPINION: It is argued that psychedelic therapies should not be approved as licensed medicines until causal pathways are clearly established between treatment and outcome. Potential downsides of doing so include, future indication expansion based on low quality clinical trial evidence, the approval of other therapies based on similarly low-quality evidence, and the potential for efficacy to change over time after approvals has been granted."
"6736","0","Initiation into methamphetamine use for young gay and bisexual men.^
Research over the past 10 years has suggested that methamphetamine use has become a significant problem and is associated with risky sexual behaviors among gay and bisexual men. In order to better understand initiation into methamphetamine use among gay and bisexual men, qualitative analyses were performed on a sample of young gay and bisexual men (ages 18-29) in New York City. Participants were recruited as part of a larger study which used time-space sampling to enroll club-going young adults who indicated recent club drug (ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, methamphetamine, cocaine, and/or LSD) use. The data for this paper are derived from the qualitative interviews of 54 gay and bisexual male methamphetamine users. At initiation (1) methamphetamine was used in a social, non-sexual setting for a majority of the participants; (2) participants expressed limited knowledge of methamphetamine; and (3) many participants used cocaine as a basis for comparison when describing various effects of the drug. The understanding that at initiation methamphetamine was not solely used as a sexual enhancement for members of this community may enable health workers to more accurately target potential users when putting forth intervention efforts. Future research should aim to gain a better understanding into the role that methamphetamine plays in non-sexual contexts, particularly among gay and bisexual men who may not be part of the club ""scene."" The relationship between attitudes towards methamphetamine and other drugs, particularly cocaine, among gay and bisexual men should be explored. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"4205","1","Characteristics of Real-world Commercially Insured Patients With Treatment-resistant Depression Initiated on Esketamine Nasal Spray or Conventional Therapies in the United States.^
Purpose: This study aimed to characterize patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) initiating esketamine or conventional therapies. Methods: Adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) were selected from the IBM MarketScan Databases. A claims-based algorithm identified patients with evidence of TRD, defined as initiation of a new antidepressant therapy after 2 different antidepressant trials of adequate dose and duration during the most recent major depressive episode. Patients receiving treatment on/after March 5, 2019 (esketamine approval date for TRD), were classified to the esketamine cohort if they newly initiated esketamine (index date) or to the TRD conventional therapies cohorts if they newly initiated electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), or pharmacologic therapies (index date was the therapy initiation date, prioritizing ECT, then TMS, then pharmacologic antidepressant therapies). Patient characteristics in the 6 months before therapy initiation were described. Findings: The esketamine cohort included 246 patients (mean age, 46.5 years; 63.0% female), and the TRD conventional therapies cohorts included 104,164 patients (mean age, 46.9 years; 74.8% female; 0.4% initiated ECT, 1.2% initiated TMS). During the 6 months preindex, in the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts, 77.6% and 41.4% received psychotherapy and 82.9% and 34.2% had a psychiatrist visit, respectively. Most patients had outpatient care for MDD in the esketamine (91.9%) and TRD conventional therapies (63.6%) cohorts; 57.3% and 21.0% received care at specialized mental health care settings. MDD was classified as “severe” among 81.3% and 35.1% of patients in the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts. Preindex mental health–related (MHR) inpatient admissions and emergency department visits were identified in 12.2% and 16.3% of the esketamine cohort and in 8.2% and 10.3% of the TRD conventional therapies cohort. Before therapy initiation, 34.6% and 17.6% of the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts received ≥3 unique antidepressants. Suicidal ideation or behavior was observed in 8.5% and 3.6% of the esketamine and TRD conventional therapies cohorts pretherapy initiation. Mean monthly all-cause health care costs in the esketamine cohort were $2532 (58.2% MHR); in the TRD conventional therapies cohorts, costs were $1873 (32.4% MHR). Implications: Among patients with TRD, those initiating esketamine relative to conventional therapies displayed higher MDD severity, used more MHR inpatient/emergency department services and antidepressant treatments, and incurred higher health care costs 6 months pretherapy initiation. These findings suggest potential benefits of identifying and treating patients with TRD earlier with more effective treatments and should inform payers in consideration of esketamine coverage."

This report describes psychological assessments of the first time ritual use of ayahuasca in the religious groups União do Vegetal and Santo Daime. Nineteen subjects who tried the beverage in Santo Daime rituals and nine subjects who tried it in União do Vegetal rituals were evaluated one to four days before their first ayahuasca experience in life and one to two weeks after this experience. Semistructured interviews and a structured psychiatric scale were used in the first evaluation to elicit set variables concerning attitudes towards the ayahuasca experience and to elicit mental health status. Mental health status was reassessed in the second evaluation, which also included a semistructured interview concerning the phenomenology of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). Predominantly positive expectancies concerning the ayahuasca experience were the most prominent findings concerning set variables. Visual phenomena, numinousness, peacefulness, insights and a distressing reaction were the most salient ASC experiences. A significant reduction of the intensity of minor psychiatric symptoms occurred in the Santo Daime group after the hallucinogen experience. Subjects in both groups reported behavioral changes towards assertiveness, serenity and vivacity/joy. The set and setting hypothesis, suggestibility processes, as well as the supposed unique effects of ayahuasca are used in discussing these findings."
"1269","1","Neural correlates of the psychedelic state as determined by fMRI studies with psilocybin.^
Psychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition."
"5735","1","The effects of repeated low doses of LSD in healthy human volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: There have been frequent reports of the use of psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at very low doses, known as 'microdosing'. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing improves cognitive functioning and mood. However, few controlled studies have examined the effects of exposure to repeated microdoses in humans. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of repeated low doses of LSD on mood, cognition, and subjective experiences in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 received four sublingual doses of placebo (n = 18), 13 μg (n = 19), or 26 μg (n = 19) of LSD administered every 3 to 4 days. Physiological, subjective, mood, and cognitive outcome measures were collected over five in‐laboratory sessions. Acute effects were examined during the first and fourth drug administration sessions, and lasting effects of LSD were examined during the fifth drug‐free session. RESULTS: Over the four drug administration sessions, repeated microdoses of LSD elicited dose‐dependent subjective “drug feel” effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05) and stimulant‐like effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05). LSD also acutely decreased negative mood during a simulated social rejection task (26 μg vs placebo, P < 0.05). Overall, the drug produced minimal effects on physiological, cognitive, and most other mood‐related measures. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to low doses of LSD have minimal effects on overall mood and cognitive performance in healthy adults. Future studies with symptomatic volunteers or different doses may be needed to investigate the claims of microdose users."
"2817","1","Changes in inflammatory biomarkers are related to the antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca is a traditional Amazon brew and its potential antidepressant properties have recently been explored in scientific settings. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca with treatment-resistant depression patients (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 45). AIMS: We are evaluating the blood inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, as a potential consequence of ayahuasca intake and their correlation with serum cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and 48 hours after substance ingestion to assess the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers, together with administration of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: At pre-treatment, patients showed higher C-reactive protein levels than healthy controls and a significant negative correlation between C-reactive protein and serum cortisol levels was revealed (rho = -0.40, n = 14). C-reactive protein in those patients was not correlated with Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. We observed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein levels across time in both patients and controls treated with ayahuasca, but not with placebo. Patients treated with ayahuasca showed a significant correlation (rho = + 0.57) between larger reductions of C-reactive protein and lower depressive symptoms at 48 hours after substance ingestion (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). No significant result with respect to interleukin 6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was found. Furthermore, these biomarkers did not predict the antidepressant response or remission rates observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and encourage further clinical trials in adults with depression."

This recent, open-label pilot study in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subjects (N = 10) found that abbreviated CBT (10 one-hour exposure sessions), delivered during the 2 weeks when ketamine putatively facilitates extinction learning, helps individuals maintain ketamine-related improvement. To refine our understanding of the role of BDNF, we performed a secondary analysis to explore whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with treatment response to either exposure-based CBT or ketamine. Given the BDNF Met allele impairs activity-dependent BDNF secretion that is critical for extinction learning, we hypothesized that patients without the BDNF Met allele would have a better OCD outcome than BDNF Met allele carriers. In this first study examining the association between the BDNF Val66Met SNP and treatment response to ketamine and CBT in OCD, there were two main findings: (1) BDNF variation was not associated with acute ketamine response on the infusion day; (2) BDNF variation was associated with differential response rate to subsequent brief, two-week, exposure-based CBT.

"7188","0","The effects of cannabinoids on serum cortisol and prolactin in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Cannabis is one of the most widely used illicit substances, and there is growing interest in the therapeutic applications of cannabinoids. While known to modulate neuroendocrine function, the precise acute and chronic dose-related effects of cannabinoids in humans are not well-known. Furthermore, the existing literature on the neuroendocrine effects of cannabinoids is limited by small sample sizes (n = 6-22), heterogeneous samples with regard to cannabis exposure (lumping users and nonusers), lack of controlling for chronic cannabis exposure, differing methodologies, and limited dose-response data. Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) was hypothesized to produce dose-related increases in plasma cortisol levels and decreases in plasma prolactin levels. Furthermore, relative to controls, frequent users of cannabis were hypothesized to show altered baseline levels of these hormones and blunted Delta-9-THC-induced changes of these hormones. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Pooled data from a series of laboratory studies with multiple doses of intravenous Delta-9-THC in healthy control subjects (n = 36) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 40) was examined to characterize the acute, chronic, and acute on chronic effects of cannabinoids on plasma cortisol and prolactin levels. Hormone levels were measured before (baseline) and 70 min after administration of each dose of Delta-9-THC. Data were analyzed using linear mixed models with +70 min hormonal levels as the dependant variable and baseline hormonal level as the covariate. RESULTS: At socially relevant doses, Delta-9-THC raised plasma cortisol levels in a dose-dependent manner but frequent users showed blunted increases relative to healthy controls. Frequent users also had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels relative to healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: These group differences may be related to the development of tolerance to the neuroendocrine effects of cannabinoids. Alternatively, these results may reflect inherent differences in neuroendocrine function in frequent users of cannabis and not a consequence of cannabis use."

The pervasive impact of trauma across populations and stages of life has made it imperative that the field of social work remain at the forefront of trauma-informed theory, research, and practice. The limited, adjunctive use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in the psychotherapeutic treatment of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a promising new treatment model that has shown impressive efficacy in phase I and II clinical trials. Preliminary meta-analysis suggests that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-PT) may be superior to prolonged exposure, a first-line treatment for PTSD, and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted the treatment 'breakthrough therapy' designation, a process of expedited review which signals that a treatment may demonstrate substantial improvement over existing therapies. Though these results are encouraging, much remains unknown and it is essential that the field of social work become informed and engaged in this new body of research. This paper will review the existing literature on MDMA-PT for PTSD, examine ethical and safety concerns, present a preliminary conceptualization of MDMA-PT’s impact on the therapeutic process, and discuss implications for future social work research and practice. This paper finds that the current literature suggests that MDMA-PT is a safe and efficacious treatment that has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of trauma. At the same time, issues of safety, cost, and accessibility should be examined in depth to ensure that this treatment—if approved by the FDA—is accessible to racially and economically marginalized clients.

"9611","1","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^
Presents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.

An increased number of binding sites (Bmax) in the platelets of ayahuasca drinkers was found, while the dissociation constant (Kd) remained the same for both groups. If indicative of neuronal 5-HT uptake activity, these results would suggest a decreased concentration of extracellular 5-HT, or a response to increased production and release of 5-HT. Such changes in 5-HT synaptic activity, in this case, should not be misinterpreted as an indication of developing neurological or psychiatric illness."

We describe a method validation for the quantification of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in tablets based on the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) guideline for quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis (qNMR). qNMR experiments were carried out on a 60 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer employing ethylene carbonate as an internal calibrant. A series of ‘ecstasy’ tablets seized at music events were quantified and the results discussed regarding their within-batch variation and yearly median dose. The method showed good specificity and selectivity, with linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery well within the UNODC recommended criteria. The limit of detection and quantification are 0.33 mg/mL and 0.10 mg/mL respectively, proving the method works well on small amounts of MDMA. Overall, the lowest amount of MDMA free base detected in this study was 9.35 mg in a piperazine mix, while the highest dosed tablet contained 237.55 mg MDMA free base, with a 9.1% decrease in median amount compared to the pre-pandemic data (2019), but still higher than the data collected in a previous study (105 mg median amount of MDMA free base in 2018). The within-batch variation was insignificant for one of the seizures but showed greater variation for the other, which confirmed that the MDMA content of a single tablet may not reflect that of the whole batch. This dynamic upward change in tablet dosage highlights the importance of ongoing trend monitoring and specific prevention intervention to counteract the negative consequences associated with MDMA use. Benchtop NMR has been successfully employed in quality control, material science and more recently, drug analysis. The present study demonstrates its beneficial application in forensic science overcoming the limitations of currently available instruments and techniques employed in harm reduction and field testing."

Introduction: Driving following illicit drug consumption ('drug-driving') is a potential road safety risk. Roadside drug testing (RDT) is conducted across Australia with the dual aims of prosecuting drivers with drugs in their system and deterring drug-driving. We examined trends over time in self-reported past six-month drug-driving among sentinel samples of regular drug users and assessed the impact of experiences of RDT on drug-driving among these participants. Methods: Data from 1913 people who inject drugs (PWID) and 3140 regular psychostimulant users (RPU) who were first-time participants in a series of repeat cross-sectional sentinel studies conducted in Australian capital cities from 2007 to 2013 and reported driving in the past six months were analysed. Trends over time were assessed using the x(2) test for trend. Multivariable logistic regressions assessed the relationship between experiences of RDT and recent drug-driving, adjusting for survey year, jurisdiction of residence and sociodemographic and drug use characteristics. Results: The percentage of participants reporting recent (past six months) drug-driving decreased significantly over time among both samples (PWID: 83% [2007] vs. 74% [2013], p < 0.001; RPU: 72% vs. 56%, p < 0.001), but drug-driving remained prevalent. Lifetime experience of RDT increased significantly over time (PWID: 6% [2007] vs. 32% [2013], p < 0.001; RPU: 2% vs. 11%, p < 0.001). There were no significant associations between experiencing RDT and drug-driving among either PWID or RPU. Conclusion: Although there is some evidence that drug-driving among, key risk groups of regular drug users is declining in Australia, possibly reflecting a general deterrent effect of RDT, experiencing RDT appears to have no specific deterrent effect on drug-driving. Further intervention, with a particular focus on changing attitudes towards drug-driving, may be needed to further reduce this practice among these groups."

Background: Despite the clinical emphasis on recommending a low sodium diet (LSD), adherence to a LSD remains poor in patients with heart failure (HF). Additional research is needed to determine successful interventions to improve adherence to a LSD and health outcomes. Purpose: To determine the effect of an education intervention on adherence to a LSD and health outcomes. Method: A total of 109 HF patients (age 64±9 years, 29% female) who were non‐adherent to LSD, indicating > 3g of 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion (24hr UNa) at baseline, were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 1) symptom monitoring and restricted 3 gram sodium diet (SMART) group, 2) the telephone monitoring (TM) group, or 3) usual care control group. The SMART group received individualized teaching and guidance of self‐monitoring for worsening symptom and sodium intake using symptom and food diary for 4 sessions over 8 weeks. Patients assigned to either of the 2 intervention groups (SMART or TM) received phone calls every 2 weeks over 8 weeks. At 6 months follow‐up, adherence to a LSD was assessed using 24hr UNa. Patients were followed for 1 year to determine time to first event of hospitalization or death due to cardiac problems. Repeated measures ANOVA and Cox regression were used to determine the effect of intervention. Results: The SMART group (n=37) showed a significant reduction in sodium intake across time compared to the TM group (n=35) and control group (n=37) (p= .022). In the Cox regression, patients in the SMART group had longer cardiac event‐free survival compared to the control group after controlling for age, gender, ejection fraction, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor use, and better blocker use (p=.008). Conclusion: An education intervention focused on self‐monitoring for symptom and sodium intake improved adherence to LSD and health outcomes in patients with HF. Helping patients engage in self‐monitoring for symptom and sodium intake by themselves can promote better health outcome."
"9158","1","Substance usage intention does not affect attentional bias: implications from Ecstasy/MDMA users and alcohol drinkers.^
Background: An attentional bias towards substance-related stimuli has been demonstrated with alcohol drinkers and many other types of substance user. There is evidence to suggest that the strength of an attentional bias may vary as a result of context (or use intention), especially within Ecstasy/MDMA users. Objective: Our aim was to empirically investigate attentional biases by observing the affect that use intention plays in recreational MDMA users and compare the findings with that of alcohol users. Method: Regular alcohol drinkers were compared with MDMA users. Performance was assessed for each group separately using two versions of an eye-tracking attentional bias task with pairs of matched neutral, and alcohol or MDMA-related visual stimuli. Dwell time was recorded for alcohol or MDMA. Participants were tested twice, when intending and not intending to use MDMA or alcohol. Note, participants in the alcohol group did not complete any tasks which involved MDMA-related stimuli and vice versa. Results: Significant attentional biases were found with both MDMA and alcohol users for respective substance-related stimuli, but not control stimuli. Critically, use intention did not affect attentional biases. Attentional biases were demonstrated with both MDMA users and alcohol drinkers when usage was and was not intended. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the robust nature of attentional biases i.e. once an attentional bias has developed, it is not readily affected by intention."
"4469","0","Are psychedelics the answer to chronic pain: A review of current literature.^
AIMS: We aim to provide an evidence-based overview of the use of psychedelics in chronic pain, specifically LSD and psilocybin. CONTENT: Chronic pain is a common and complex problem, with an unknown etiology. Psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin, may play a role in the management of chronic pain. Through activation of the serotonin-2A (5-HT2A) receptor, several neurophysiological responses result in the disruption of functional connections in brain regions associated with chronic pain. Healthy reconnections can be made through neuroplastic effects, resulting in sustained pain relief. However, this process is not fully understood, and evidence of efficacy is limited and of low quality. In cancer and palliative related pain, the analgesic potential of psychedelics was established decades ago, and the current literature shows promising results on efficacy and safety in patients with cancer-related psychological distress. In other areas, patients suffering from severe headache disorders like migraine and cluster headache who have self-medicated with psychedelics report both acute and prophylactic efficacy of LSD and psilocybin. Randomized control trials are now being conducted to study the effects in cluster headache Furthermore, psychedelics have a generally favorable safety profile especially when compared to other analgesics like opioids. In addition, psychedelics do not have the addictive potential of opioids. IMPLICATIONS: Given the current epidemic use of opioids, and that patients are in desperate need of an alternative treatment, it is important that further research is conducted on the efficacy of psychedelics in chronic pain conditions."
"5695","1","MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD: study design and rationale for phase 3 trials based on pooled analysis of six phase 2 randomized controlled trials.^
BACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial impact on daily functioning that lacks sufficient treatment options. Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. METHODS: Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017. Active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg, n = 72) or placebo/control doses (0-40 mg, n = 31) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8-h sessions spaced a month apart. Three non-drug 90-min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure, and three to four followed each experimental session. RESULTS: After two blinded experimental sessions, the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline than the control group [MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001]. The between-group Cohen's d effect size was 0.8, indicating a large treatment effect. After two experimental sessions, more participants in the active group (54.2%) did not meet CAPS-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group (22.6%). Depression symptom improvement on the BDI-II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group, although only trended towards significant group differences [MMRM, estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 6.0 (3.03), P = 0.053]. All doses of MDMA were well tolerated, with some expected reactions occurring at greater frequency for the active MDMA group during experimental sessions and the 7 days following. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was efficacious and well tolerated in a large sample of adults with PTSD. These studies supported expansion into phase 3 trials and led to FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation for this promising treatment. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT00090064, NCT00353938, NCT01958593, NCT01211405, NCT01689740, NCT01793610."
"9011","0","Propofol pretreatment increases antidepressant-like effects induced by acute administration of ketamine in rats receiving forced swimming test.^
Animal and clinical studies have demonstrated that ketamine has quick, obvious and persistent antidepressant-like effect, but such side effects as cardiovascular system excitement and hallucinogenic activity have limited its clinical application. Intravenous anesthetic propofol can remarkably inhibit or eliminate ketamine's side effects including cardiovascular system excitement and hallucinogenic activity even in a sub-anesthesia dose. However, effect of propofol on rapid antidepressant-like action induced by ketamine still remains unclear. The present study aimed to investigate effect of pretreatment with propofol on the ketamine-induced rapid antidepressant-like action in rats receiving forced swimming test. Open field test and forced swimming test were used to investigate behavior changes of rats receiving different medication. Expression of brain derived neurotrophic factors (BDNF) and a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA) pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus was measured with sandwich-ELISA and Western Blot, respectively. Results demonstrated that rats receiving propofol alone showed neither antidepressant-like effects nor increased BDNF content; pretreatment with propofol could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effects and the expression of AMPA pGluR1-Ser845 in hippocampus. but could not further reinforce the increased BDNF content induced by ketamine in hippocampus; after AMPA receptor was antagonized, the strengthening effect of propofol on ketamine-induced antidepressant-like action significantly decreased. The results indicated that propofol in a sub-anesthetic dose could increase the ketamine-induced antidepressant-like effect. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

"4783","1","Arketamine as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression: A placebo-controlled pilot study.^
Background: Racemic ketamine is a mixture of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine), with the latter regarded as the main isomer for antidepressant effects. However, preclinical data and one open-label human trial suggest arketamine might exert a more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effect with fewer side effects. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of arketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to assess its efficacy and safety compared to placebo. Methods: This is a, randomized, double-blind, crossover, pilot trial (n = 10). All participants received saline and arketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a one-week interval. Treatment effects were analyzed with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. Results: Our analysis suggested the presence of a carryover effect, so the main efficacy analysis was limited to the first week, which demonstrated a main effect of time (p = 0.038) but not for treatment (p = 0.40) or their interaction (p = 0.95). This indicates that depression improved over time, but without significant difference between arketamine and placebo. Analyzing the two weeks together, findings were the same. Dissociation and other adverse events were minimal. Limitations: This was a pilot study with a small sample and underpowered. Conclusions: Arketamine was not superior to placebo for TRD but demonstrated to be extremely safe. Our findings reinforce the importance of continuing studies with this drug, with better powered clinical trials, perhaps considering a parallel design with higher or flexible doses and repeated administrations.

"1362","1","Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy-A Systematic Review of Associated Psychological Interventions.^
Modern clinical research on psychedelics is generating interesting outcomes in a wide array of clinical conditions when psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is delivered to appropriately screened participants and in controlled settings. Still, a number of patients relapse or are less responsive to such treatments. Individual and contextual factors (i.e., set and setting) seem to play a role in shaping the psychedelic experience and in determining clinical outcomes. These findings, coupled with data from literature on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, frame the therapeutic context as a potential moderator of clinical efficacy, highlighting the need to investigate how to functionally employ environmental and relational factors. In this review, we performed a structured search through two databases (i.e., PubMed/Medline and Scopus) to identify records of clinical studies on psychedelics which used and described a structured associated psychotherapeutic intervention. The aim is to construct a picture of what models of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy are currently adopted in clinical research and to report on their clinical outcomes. Ad-hoc and adapted therapeutic methods were identified. Common principles, points of divergence and future directions are highlighted and discussed with special attention toward therapeutic stance, degree of directiveness and the potential suggestive effects of information provided to patients."
"1725","0","Effects of classic psychedelic drugs on turbulent signatures in brain dynamics.^
Psychedelic drugs show promise as safe and effective treatments for neuropsychiatric disorders, yet their mechanisms of action are not fully understood. A fundamental hypothesis is that psychedelics work by dose-dependently changing the functional hierarchy of brain dynamics, but it is unclear whether different psychedelics act similarly. Here, we investigated the changes in the brain’s functional hierarchy associated with two different psychedelics (LSD and psilocybin). Using a novel turbulence framework, we were able to determine the vorticity, that is, the local level of synchronization, that allowed us to extend the standard global time-based measure of metastability to become a local-based measure of both space and time. This framework produced detailed signatures of turbulence-based hierarchical change for each psychedelic drug, revealing consistent and discriminate effects on a higher level network, that is, the default mode network. Overall, our findings directly support a prior hypothesis that psychedelics modulate (i.e., “compress”) the functional hierarchy and provide a quantification of these changes for two different psychedelics. Implications for therapeutic applications of psychedelics are discussed."
"4634","1","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^
Objective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB."
"8480","1","Association of study characteristics with estimates of effect size in studies of ecstasy use.^
Studies of the chronic effects of MDMA, or 'ecstasy', in humans have been largely inconsistent. We explored whether study-level characteristics are associated with the effect size estimate reported. We based our analyses on the recent systematic review by Rogers and colleagues, focusing on those meta-analyses within this report where there was a relatively large number of studies contributing to each individual meta-analysis. Linear regression was used to investigate the association between study level variables and effect size estimate, weighted by the inverse of the SE of the effect size estimate, with cluster correction for studies which contributed multiple estimates. This indicated an association between effect size estimate and both user group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting former users compared with those recruiting current users, and control group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting polydrug user controls compared with those recruiting drug-naïve controls. In addition, increasing year of publication was associated with reduced effect size estimate, and there was a trend level association with prevalence of ecstasy use, reflecting smaller estimates among studies conducted in countries with higher prevalence of ecstasy use. Our data suggest a number of study-level characteristics which appear to influence individual study effect size estimates. These should be considered when designing future studies, and also when interpreting the ecstasy literature as a whole."
"557","0","Clinical trials for rapid changes in suicidal ideation: Lessons from ketamine.^
Rapid-acting treatments for suicidal thoughts are critically needed. Consequently, there is a burgeoning literature exploring psychotherapeutic, pharmacologic, or device-based brief interventions for suicidal thoughts characterized by a rapid onset of action. Not only do these innovative treatments have potentially important clinical benefits to patient populations, they also highlight a number of methodological considerations for suicide research. First, while most clinical trials related to suicide risk focus on suicide attempts, new clinical trials that use suicidal thoughts as the primary outcome require a number of slight modifications to their clinical trial design. Second, the rapid onset of these new interventions permits an experimental therapeutics approach to suicide research, in which psychological and neurobiological markers are embedded into clinical trials to better understand the underlying pathophysiology of suicidal thoughts. The following review discusses these methodological innovations in light of recent research using the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine, which has been associated with rapid effects on suicidal thoughts. We hope that ""lessons learned"" from the ketamine literature will provide a blueprint for all researchers evaluating rapid-acting treatments for suicidal thoughts, whether pharmacologic or psychotherapeutic."
"1028","1","Psilocybin disrupts sensory and higher order cognitive processing but not pre-attentive cognitive processing-study on P300 and mismatch negativity in healthy volunteers.^
RATIONALE: Disruption of auditory event-related evoked potentials (ERPs) P300 and mismatch negativity (MMN), electrophysiological markers of attentive and pre-attentive cognitive processing, is repeatedly described in psychosis and schizophrenia. Similar findings were observed in a glutamatergic model of psychosis, but the role of serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors in information processing is less clear. OBJECTIVES: We studied ERPs in a serotonergic model of psychosis, induced by psilocybin, a psychedelic with 5-HT(2A/C) agonistic properties, in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty subjects (10M/10F) were given 0.26 mg/kg of psilocybin orally in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. ERPs (P300, MMN) were registered during the peak of intoxication. Correlations between measured electrophysiological variables and psilocin serum levels and neuropsychological effects were also analyzed. RESULTS: Psilocybin induced robust psychedelic effects and psychotic-like symptoms, decreased P300 amplitude (p = 0.009) but did not affect the MMN. Psilocybin's disruptive effect on P300 correlated with the intensity of the psychedelic state, which was dependent on the psilocin serum levels. We also observed a decrease in N100 amplitude (p = 0.039) in the P300 paradigm and a negative correlation between P300 and MMN amplitude (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Even though pre-attentive cognition (MMN) was not affected, processing at the early perceptual level (N100) and in higher-order cognition (P300) was significantly disrupted by psilocybin. Our results have implications for the role of 5-HT(2A) receptors in altered information processing in psychosis and schizophrenia."
"199","0","Modeling ""psychosis"" in vitro by inducing disordered neuronal network activity in cortical brain slices.^
INTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of neuronal networks has been suggested to underlie the cognitive and perceptual abnormalities observed schizophrenia. DISCUSSIONS: An in vitro model of psychosis is proposed based on the two different approaches to cause aberrant network activity in layer V pyramidal cells of prefrontal brain slices: (1) psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide and (2) minimal GABA(A) receptor antagonism, modeling the GABA interneuron deficit in schizophrenia. A test of this model would be to determine if drugs that normalize aberrant networks in brain slices have efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. Selective agonists of glutamate mGlu2/3 metabotropic receptors, which are highly effective in suppressing aberrant network activity in slices, are the most advanced toward reaching that clinical endpoint. In accord with the model, a recent phase II clinical trial shows that an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist is equivalent in efficacy to a standard antipsychotic drug for both negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but without the usual side effects. D1/5 dopamine receptor agonists are also effective in normalizing aberrant network activity induced by both hallucinogens and minimal GABA(A) antagonism; clinical efficacy remains to be determined. A general model of network regulation is presented, involving astrocytes, GABA interneurons, and glutamatergic pyramidal cells, revealing a wide range of potential sites hitherto not considered as therapeutic targets."

Participants will be randomized to an active group or control group (46 per group). Participants will undergo a total of 2 dosing sessions (whether psilocybin or placebo). The active group will receive 40mg psilocybin first. All participants will receive a second dosing session at three months. The active group will be further randomized, with half receiving 40mg psilocybin, and half receiving placebo at three months to test a secondary hypothesis that two doses of psilocybin are more effective in treating OUD than a single dose."

"2447","0","Alcohol and drug use during sex and its association with sexually transmitted infections: a retrospective cohort study among young people aged under 25 years visiting Dutch STI clinics.^
Introduction Alcohol use and drug use are common behaviours among young people. STI positivity is higher in young people than in people aged above 25 years. While there is an increasing amount of knowledge about drug use during sex among men who have sex with men (MSM), data on this behaviour among young women and heterosexual men are scarce. Therefore, this study aims to assess the proportion and characteristics of women and heterosexual men aged under 25 years reporting alcohol and/or drug use during sex and its association with STI positivity. Methods Surveillance data of heterosexual individuals younger than 25 years visiting two Dutch STI clinics between 2016 and 2019 were assessed (n=11 714). We used multivariable logistic regression analyses to assess associations between alcohol and drug use during sex and STI positivity (Chlamydia trachomatis and/or Neisseria gonorrhoeae diagnosis), adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics (sex, age, ethnicity, educational level, socioeconomic status and urbanisation) and sexual behaviour (condom use, number of sex partners). Results Alcohol use during sex was reported by 45.3% (5311/11 714; 49.5% in men vs 43.2% in women, p<0.001) and drug use during sex by 22.0% (2580/11 714; 30.7% in men vs 17.6% in women, p<0.001). The most reported drugs were cannabis (17.9%), ecstasy (XTC)/methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (6.9%) and cocaine (4.7%). The use of at least one of the following drugs (XTC/MDMA, cocaine, speed, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)/gamma-butyrolactone (GBL), heroin, crystal meth and/or designer drugs) was significantly associated with STI positivity after adjustment for sociodemographic characteristics (adjusted OR (aOR): 1.3, 95% CI 1.1 to 1.4), but this association did not remain significant after adjustment for sexual behaviour (aOR: 1.12, 95% CI 0.94 to 1.34). Significant associations between drug use during sex and inconsistent condom (aOR: 2.5, 95% CI 1.9 to 3.2) use and having four or more sex partners (aOR: 3.2, 95% CI 2.8 to 3.6) in the past 6 months were assessed. Discussion Alcohol and drug use during sex was highly prevalent among young women and heterosexual men visiting the STI clinic and drug use during sex was associated with an increased risk for STI, probably mediated by sexual behaviour. This indicates that a holistic health promotion strategy, addressing STI prevention and alcohol and drug use-related harm reduction, is important in this group. STI clinics should address this behaviour not only among MSM, but also among young women and heterosexual men."

"5944","1","Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.^
The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
"1522","1","Safety and efficacy of intranasal ketamine for acute postoperative pain.^
Background: Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine are analgesic. Intranasal administration offers a non-invasive route for systemic drug delivery. We evaluated the safety and analgesic efficacy of intranasal ketamine in treating moderate-to-severe, acute postoperative pain in the molar extraction model. Methods: Intranasal ketamine (10 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg) and placebo were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, parallel study in 40 patients undergoing removal of 2-4 impacted third molars. Analgesic efficacy was assessed over a 3 h period following drug administration. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting, vital signs, pulse oximetry, nasal assessments, and a standard dissociative side effects questionnaire. Results: Ketamine delivered intranasally was well tolerated. Statistically significant analgesia, superior to placebo, was observed with the highest dose tested, 50 mg, over a 3 h period. Rapid onset of analgesia was reported (<10 min), and meaningful pain relief was achieved within 15 min of the 50 mg dose. The majority of adverse events were mild/weak and transient. No untoward effects were observed on vital signs, pulse oximetry, and nasal examination. At the doses tested, no significant dissociative effects were evident using the Side Effects Rating Scale for Dissociative Anaesthetics. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine may offer a safe, nonopioid, well-tolerated, needle-free analgesic with efficacy in moderate-to-severe acute pain.

"8737","1","Post-LSD hallucinosis is associated with decrease in flicker-fusion sensitivities.^
Purpose. LSD and similar agents may alter visual perceptions continuously and permanently in certain users resulting in hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD)1. In the present study, the psychophysical De Lange curves (TMTF curves) were established to determine how HPPD affected former LSD abusers. Methods. Sinusoidal waveform stimulation was used and generated by a visual stimulator2. The stimuli were achromatic, with 200 troland luminance, 50° field size, and were seen under a Maxwellian view. Nine flicker frequencies were tested. At each frequency, the measurement was triplicated using the ""fusion to flicker with preview"" method3 and the results were averaged. The examiner was blinded to the diagnostic status of the subjects. Eighteen subjects participated in the study. They formed three equal number groups: LSD naive controls (age: 25±2.9 years), post-LSD subjects without HPPD (age: 27.2±8.5) and post-LSD subjects with HPPD (age: 22.4±4.2). The LSD groups had a history of LSD use 2-3 years prior to the study. At the time of testing, subjects were drug-free verified by toxicological screening. Binocular corrected visual acuity was normal in all subjects. Results. The De Lange curves were established in 10-15 minutes for each subject. Among the three groups: 1) The difference in high frequency sensitivities (> 30 Hz) was not statistically significant; 2) By contrast, the sensitivities at lower frequencies differed markedly: the lower the frequencies, the greater the difference, e.g., at 5 Hz the sensitivities of the control group were more than 3 times those of the LSD subjects without HPPD, and 5 times those of LSD with HPPD; and 3) The differences of the CFF values were statistically significant using an ANOVA (p<0.001). Conclusions. 1) LSD reduces sensitivities to the flicker at frequencies less than 30 Hz; 2) Patients with post-LSD hallucinations have the least sensitivity to the flicker perception, followed by asymptomatic LSD users, followed by LSD naive controls; 3) The De Lange curve is a sensitive, specific and reliable method to determine this; 4) Decreased sensitivity to flicker is consistent with the hypothesis that HPPD is associated with disinhibition of visual information processing."
"1941","1","Memory and mood during MDMA intoxication, with and without memantine pretreatment.^
Previous studies have shown that single doses of MDMA can affect mood and impair memory in humans. The neuropharmacological mechanisms involved in MDMA-induced memory impairment are not clear. Memantine, an NMDA and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, was able to reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment in rats. This study investigated whether treatment with memantine can prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in humans. 15 subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject design. Subjects received both pre-treatment (placebo/memantine 20 mg) (T1) and treatment (placebo/MDMA 75 mg) (T2) on separate test days. T1 preceded T2 by 120 min. Memory function was assessed 90 min after T2 by means of a Visual Verbal Learning Task, a Prospective Memory Task, the Sternberg Memory Task and the Abstract Visual Pattern Learning Task. Profile of Mood State and psychomotor performance were also assessed to control whether MDMA and memantine interactions would selectively pertain to memory or transfer to other domains as well. MDMA significantly impaired performance in the visual verbal learning task and abstract visual pattern learning task. Pre-treatment with memantine did not prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in these two tasks. Both positive (vigour, arousal, elation) and negative mood effects (anxiety) were increased by MDMA. The responses were not altered by pretreatment with memantine which had no effect on memory or mood when given alone. These preliminary results suggest that memantine does not reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment and mood in humans. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'CNS Stimulants'."
"5430","0","Engagement in Chemsex among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in Malaysia: Prevalence and Associated Factors from an Online National Survey.^
Background: Chemsex is the use of illicit drugs—particularly methamphetamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)—to enhance sexual activity. Chemsex, which occurs primarily among communities of men who have sex with men (MSM), is associated with greater HIV risk behaviors, including multiple sex partners, group sex, condomless sex, and injection drug use. Despite evidence showing chemsex engagement among Malaysian MSM, there is a paucity of research on chemsex among MSM in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (August to September 2021) among 870 Malaysian MSM. Participants were recruited through targeted advertisements on social networks. We collected information regarding participants’ recent (<6 months) engagement in chemsex, demographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and history, and recent sexual- and drug-related behavior. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with recent (<6 months) chemsex engagement. Results: Just under 1 in 10 (9.0%) of participants reported having engaged in chemsex in the previous six months. More than two-thirds of participants (69.1%) had not disclosed their sexual orientation to anyone in their family and 35.2% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Multivariable analysis found that recent injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio: aOR = 6.61; 95% confidence interval: CI, 2.30–19.03), having shared pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with someone else (aOR = 5.60; 95% CI, 1.76–17.77), higher perceived HIV risk (aOR = 3.15; 95% CI, 1.25–7.93), knowing someone using PrEP (aOR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.62–5.31), recent engagement in transactional sex (aOR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.06–5.39), having a recent STI diagnosis (aOR = 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25–4.44), recent engagement in anal sex (aOR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.07–4.57), and recent sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive partner (aOR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.07–4.08) were associated with recent engagement in chemsex. Conclusions: Malaysian MSM who practice chemsex are vulnerable to several HIV risk factors, such as transactional sex, HIV-positive sexual partners, and injection drug use. There is an urgent need for programs that integrate drug, sexual health, and mental health services, with a focus on harm reduction (e.g., condoms, access to and utilization of HIV testing and PrEP services, drug knowledge, and safer drug use) tailored for MSM who practice chemsex."
"354","0","‘Never drop without your significant other, cause that way lies ruin’: The boundary work of couples who use MDMA together.^
MDMA has a variety of pro-social effects, such as increased friendliness and heightened empathy, yet there is a distinct lack of research examining how these effects might intertwine with a romantic relationship. This article seeks to compensate for this absence and explore heterosexual couples’ use of MDMA through the lens of the boundaries they construct around these experiences. Three couple interviews, two diary interviews and eight written diaries about couples’ MDMA practices were analysed. Douglas’ (2001) and Stenner's (2013) work around order, disorder and what lies at the threshold between the two are employed here. This conceptual approach allows us to see what happens at the border of MDMA experiences as crucial to their constitution. Two main themes are identified in the data. First, MDMA use was boundaried from daily life both temporally and corporeally: the drug was tied to particular times in people's lives as well as the performance of rituals which engaged the material world and reenchanted everyday spaces and selves. Secondly, other people are excluded from MDMA experiences to varying degrees in order to preserve the emotionally intense space for the couple alone. This paper claims that MDMA use forms part of a spectrum of relationship ‘work’ practices; a unique kind of ‘date night’ that revitalises couples’ connection. Hence, MDMA should be recognised as transforming couple as well as individual practices. Finally, it is suggested that harm reduction initiatives could distinguish more ‘messy’ forms of emotional harm and engage with users’ language of ‘specialness’ to limit negative impacts of MDMA use."

"7943","1","A randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study of efficacy, safety, and durability of repeated vs single subanesthetic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^
The strategy of repeated ketamine in open-label and saline-control studies of treatment-resistant depression suggested greater antidepressant response beyond a single ketamine. However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure."
"9527","0","Arketamine, a new rapid-acting antidepressant: A historical review and future directions.^
The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist (R,S)-ketamine causes rapid onset and sustained antidepressant actions in treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and other psychiatric disorders, such as bipolar disorder and post-traumatic stress disorder. (R,S)-ketamine is a racemic mixture consisting of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine), with (S)-enantiomer having greater affinity for the NMDAR. In 2019, an esketamine nasal spray by Johnson & Johnson was approved in the USA and Europe for treatment-resistant depression. In contrast, an increasing number of preclinical studies show that arketamine has greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant-like effects than esketamine in rodents, despite the lower binding affinity of arketamine for the NMDAR. Importantly, the side effects, i.e., psychotomimetic and dissociative effects and abuse liability, of arketamine are less than those of (R,S)-ketamine and esketamine in animals and humans. An open-label study demonstrated the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of arketamine in treatment-resistant patients with MDD. A phase 2 clinical trial of arketamine in treatment-resistant patients with MDD is underway. This study was designed to review the brief history of the novel antidepressant arketamine, the molecular mechanisms underlying its antidepressant actions, and future directions."
"2912","1","Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^
Opioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents."
"3481","0","Smoking-related prospective memory deficits observed on naturalistic everyday memory task.^
OBJECTIVE: This study assessed self-reported and objective prospective memory (PM) processes in smokers and a never-smoked comparison group. If persistent smoking does impair PM, then one would expect smokers recall being lower on a study that requires them to remember everyday activities when compared with a never-smoked group. METHOD: An existing-groups design was used to compare a group of smokers with a never-smoked group on the self-report Prospective Memory Questionnaire (PMQ) and the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure (PRVP) measuring objective PM. An example of the location-action combination from the PRVP is 'At Thornton's shop' (location), 'Buy a bag of sweets' (action). Participants who reported using an illegal substance (e.g. ecstasy, cannabis), who drank excessively or were 'binge drinkers', or who reported suffering from a clinical condition, such as depression, were excluded from the study. Age, weekly 'safe levels' alcohol use, and strategy use were also measured and controlled for in the study. Each person was tested individually in a quiet laboratory setting on a university campus. RESULTS: After controlling for variations in age, weekly alcohol use, and strategy use, smokers recalled significantly fewer location-action combinations on the PRVP when compared with a never-smoked group, with no between-group differences on self-reported PM as measured by the PMQ. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest objective PM deficits are associated with persistent smoking - a relatively unexplored area of research. This cannot be attributed to other drug use, mood, or strategy use. The findings also suggest smokers lack self-awareness of such PM deficits. This study extends the area by utilising a more naturalistic object measure of PM and incorporating strict controls into the study."
"988","1","Acute effects of ayahuasca on neuropsychological performance: differences in executive function between experienced and occasional users.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea containing the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine, has been shown to increase regional cerebral blood flow in prefrontal brain regions after acute administration to humans. Despite interactions at this level, neuropsychological studies have not found cognitive deficits in abstinent long-term users. OBJECTIVES: Here, we wished to investigate the effects of acute ayahuasca intake on neuropsychological performance, specifically on working memory and executive function. METHODS: Twenty-four ayahuasca users (11 long-term experienced users and 13 occasional users) were assessed in their habitual setting using the Stroop, Sternberg, and Tower of London tasks prior to and following ayahuasca intake. RESULTS: Errors in the Sternberg task increased, whereas reaction times in the Stroop task decreased and accuracy was maintained for the whole sample following ayahuasca intake. Interestingly, results in the Tower of London showed significantly increased execution and resolution times and number of movements for the occasional but not the experienced users. Additionally, a correlation analysis including all subjects showed that impaired performance in the Tower of London was inversely correlated with lifetime ayahuasca use. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ayahuasca administration impaired working memory but decreased stimulus-response interference. Interestingly, detrimental effects on higher cognition were only observed in the less experienced group. Rather than leading to increased impairment, greater prior exposure to ayahuasca was associated with reduced incapacitation. Compensatory or neuromodulatory effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake could underlie preserved executive function in experienced users."
"2936","1","Comparative evaluation of midazolam and ketamine with midazolam alone as oral premedication.^
BACKGROUND: Oral premedication with midazolam and ketamine is widely used in pediatric anesthesia to reduce emotional trauma and ensure smooth induction. However, various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low-dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine. The preoperative sedation score, ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4-point scale. The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted. RESULTS: Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups (group M 95.9%; group MK 97.96%), without any serious side effects. However, the combination offered significantly more children in an awake, calm and quiet state, who were easily separated from their parents (73.46% in MK vs 41% in group M). The induction scores were comparable between the groups. The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics. However, the combination provided more children in an awake, calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents."

Objectives: This study investigated suicidal ideation and its correlates among juvenile delinquents in South Korea. Methods: Suicidal ideation, psychological health status, and health-related behaviors were assessed using a self-administered questionnaire in 1682 juvenile offenders aged between 15 and 18 years in 2012. Results: The prevalence of suicidal ideation in juvenile delinquents was 15.2%. Girls were more likely to report suicidal thoughts than boys (30.3% vs. 12.7%). Suicidal ideation was more common among adolescents who were not living with their family prior to entering detention centers (22.6% vs. 13.2%) than their counterparts. The likelihood of suicidal ideation was significantly associated with problem drinking [odds ratio (OR)=1.84], psychedelic drug use (OR=2.04), feeling unhappy (OR=3.05), feeling sad or depressed (OR=13.37) after controlling for sociodemographic factors, other health behaviors and perceptions. Conclusion: The present study provides evidence for an association between suicidal ideation and psychological health and health risk behaviors among juvenile delinquents. It also highlights the importance of mental health and behavioral interventions for this population to prevent suicidality."
"4143","1","Positive expectations predict improved mental-health outcomes linked to psychedelic microdosing.^
Psychedelic microdosing describes the ingestion of near-threshold perceptible doses of classic psychedelic substances. Anecdotal reports and observational studies suggest that microdosing may promote positive mood and well-being, but recent placebo-controlled studies failed to find compelling evidence for this. The present study collected web-based mental health and related data using a prospective (before, during and after) design. Individuals planning a weekly microdosing regimen completed surveys at strategic timepoints, spanning a core four-week test period. Eighty-one participants completed the primary study endpoint. Results revealed increased self-reported psychological well-being, emotional stability and reductions in state anxiety and depressive symptoms at the four-week primary endpoint, plus increases in psychological resilience, social connectedness, agreeableness, nature relatedness and aspects of psychological flexibility. However, positive expectancy scores at baseline predicted subsequent improvements in well-being, suggestive of a significant placebo response. This study highlights a role for positive expectancy in predicting positive outcomes following psychedelic microdosing and cautions against zealous inferences on its putative therapeutic value."

This paper reports on changes in substance use and substance dependence symptoms-without intervention-among young adult multidrug users in the club scene, ages 18-29, (N= 444) who participated in a natural history study. Computer-assisted personal interviews at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups included well-tested measures of substance use and dependence. Changes in substance dependence symptoms and drug use frequencies were calculated using Cohen's d statistic. Mean age was 22; 40% were female; 58% were Hispanic, 17% White, and 21% Black. At 18-month follow-up assessment, participants reported significantly fewer days of cocaine (d= - .85 at 18. months), ecstasy (d= - .93), benzodiazepine (d= - .82), and prescription opioid (d= - .81) use, as well as reduced substance dependence symptoms (d= - .42). These results, together with data from focus groups with completers, suggest that comprehensive health and social risk assessments may have quite strong intervention effects among young adult multidrug users. © 2013 Elsevier Inc."
"7574","1","Single and repeated ketamine treatment induces perfusion changes in sensory and limbic networks in major depressive disorder.^
Ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). Yet, how single and repeated ketamine treatment induces brain systems-level neuroplasticity underlying symptom improvement is unknown. Advanced multiband imaging (MB) pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion MRI data was acquired from patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) (N = 22, mean age=35.2 ± 9.95 SD, 27% female) at baseline, and 24 h after receiving single, and four subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous ketamine infusions. Changes in global and regional CBF were compared across time points, and relationships with overall mood, anhedonia and apathy were examined. Comparisons between patients at baseline and controls (N = 18, mean age=36.11 ± 14.5 SD, 57% female) established normalization of treatment effects. Results showed increased regional CBF in the cingulate and primary and higher-order visual association regions after first ketamine treatment. Baseline CBF in the fusiform, and acute changes in CBF in visual areas were related to symptom improvement after single and repeated ketamine treatment, respectively. In contrast, after serial infusion therapy, decreases in regional CBF were observed in the bilateral hippocampus and right insula with ketamine treatment. Findings demonstrate that neurophysiological changes occurring with single and repeated ketamine treatment follow both a regional and temporal pattern including sensory and limbic regions. Initial changes are observed in the posterior cingulate and precuneus and primary and higher-order visual areas, which relate to clinical responses. However, repeated exposure to ketamine, though not relating to clinical outcome, appears to engage deeper limbic structures and insula. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"760","0","Changing Patterns of Substance Use During the Coronavirus Pandemic: Self-Reported Use of Tobacco, Alcohol, Cannabis, and Other Drugs.^
As in many other countries worldwide, the coronavirus pandemic prompted the implementation of an “intelligent lockdown” in the spring of 2020 in the Netherlands, including the closure of nightlife venues and cancellation of festivals. Such restrictions and social distancing could particularly affect people who use alcohol or other drugs in recreational settings and give rise to new challenges and additional needs in the field of addiction prevention and care. To monitor changes in substance use and provide services with practical directions for tailored prevention, an anonymous web survey was set up, targeting a convenience sample aged 16 years or older through various social media and other online channels. Between May and October 2020, a total of 6,070 participants completed the survey, mainly adolescents and young adults (16–24 years old). These data were used to explore and describe changing patterns in substance use. Overall results showed declined current use compared to “pre-corona,” but mask underlying variation in changing patterns, including discontinued (tobacco 10.4%, alcohol 11.3%, cannabis 16.3%, other drugs 30.4%), decreased (tobacco 23.0%, alcohol 29.1%, cannabis 17.4%, other drugs 20.7%), unchanged (tobacco 30.3%, alcohol 21.2%, cannabis 22.3%, other drugs 17.3%), increased (tobacco 29.6%, alcohol 32.1%, cannabis 32.9%, other drugs 25.3%), and (re)commenced use (tobacco 6.7%, alcohol 6.3%, cannabis 11.1%, other drugs 6.2%). Especially the use of drugs like ecstasy and nitrous oxide was discontinued or decreased due to the lack of social occasions for use. Increased use was associated with coping motives for all substance types. As measures combatting the coronavirus may need to be practiced for some time to come, possibly leading to prolonged changes in substance use with lingering “post-corona” consequences, timely and ongoing monitoring of changing patterns of substance use is vital for informing prevention services within this field."
"8527","1","Ayahuasca-assisted therapy for addiction: results from a preliminary observational study in Canada.^
INTRODUCTION: This paper reports results from a preliminary observational study of ayahuasca-assisted treatment for problematic substance use and stress delivered in a rural First Nations community in British Columbia, Canada. METHODS: The ""Working with Addiction and Stress"" retreats combined four days of group counselling with two expert-led ayahuasca ceremonies. This study collected pre-treatment and six months follow-up data from 12 participants on several psychological and behavioral factors related to problematic substance use, and qualitative data assessing the personal experiences of the participants six months after the retreat. FINDINGS: Statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements were demonstrated for scales assessing hopefulness, empowerment, mindfulness, and quality of life meaning and outlook subscales. Self-reported alcohol, tobacco and cocaine use declined, although cannabis and opiate use did not; reported reductions in problematic cocaine use were statistically significant. All study participants reported positive and lasting changes from participating in the retreats. CONCLUSIONS: This form of ayahuasca-assisted therapy appears to be associated with statistically significant improvements in several factors related to problematic substance use among a rural aboriginal population. These findings suggest participants may have experienced positive psychological and behavioral changes in response to this therapeutic approach, and that more rigorous research of ayahuasca-assisted therapy for problematic substance use is warranted."

Methylone is a synthetic cathinone that has been popularized as an alternative to other illegal psychostimulants as methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) or mephedrone. Chemically, methylone is a beta‐keto analogue of ecstasy with similar pharmacological effects in animals. To date, the available data about the human pharmacology of methylone in humans is very scarce and is mainly provided by users' experience published in internet forums or intoxication reports. A pilot study was carried out to select the methylone dose used in this study. This current study is aimed 1) To assess the abuse potential of methylone after controlled administration of a single oral dose of methylone 2) to evaluate subjective and physiological effects of methylone 3) to determine the pharmacokinetics parameters and metabolism of methylone."

To assess the serotonergic function of alcoholics, their neuroendocrine and psychological responsivities to the serotonergic partial agonist meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (m-CPP) was compared with the responsitivity of healthy subjects, The effect of m-CPP on craving for alcohol was also assessed in the alcoholics, Sixteen patients and 14 controls were tested under double-blind, placebo-controlled conditions, m-CPP (0.5 mg/kg of body weight) was given orally, Alcoholics were tested after a period of abstinence of 15 to 39 days. The two groups of subjects did not differ in their cortisol response to m-CPP, but the prolactin response of alcoholics was significantly blunted, Alcoholics reported a significantly more intense ''high'' feeling after m-CPP than the healthy subjects, m-CPP induced also a decreased craving for alcohol, Our data thus provide further evidence for the existence of a serotonergic dysfunction in alcoholics and a modulation of craving for alcohol by serotonergic systems."
"8334","1","Increasing MDMA use among college students: Results of a national survey.^
Purpose: To examine the prevalence and changing patterns of ecstasy use among college students, and to determine characteristics, associated behaviors, and interests of ecstasy users. Methods: The study analyzes data regarding ecstasy use and related behaviors from the 1997 and 1999 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol Study. This is a survey of a nationally representative sample of over 14,000 college students at 119 U.S. four-year colleges. Changes in self-reported annual ecstasy use were examined, and lifestyle and high-risk behaviors associated with Ecstasy use were identified. Data were analyzed using 2 × 2 Chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression fitted by the generalized estimating equations (GEE). Results: The prevalence of past year ecstasy use rose from 2.8% to 4.7% between 1997 and 1999, an increase of 69%. This increase was observed across nearly all subgroups of student and college type. A smaller sample of ten colleges revealed that the increase continued in 2000. Ecstasy users were more likely to use marijuana, engage in binge drinking, smoke cigarettes, have multiple sexual partners, consider arts and parties as important, religion as less important, spend more times socializing with friends, and spend less times studying. Unlike other illicit drug users, ecstasy users were not academic underachievers and their satisfaction with education was not different from that of non-ecstasy users. Conclusion: Ecstasy use is a high-risk behavior among college students which has increased rapidly in the past decade. © Society for Adolescent Medicine, 2001."
"956","1","Acute effects of MDMA on trust, cooperative behaviour and empathy: A double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment.^
BACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is being actively researched as an adjunct to psychotherapy. It may be beneficial to trust, empathy and cooperative behaviour due to its acute prosocial effects. AIM: To test (a) the acute effects of MDMA on measures of empathy, trust and cooperative behaviour, and (b) subacute changes in mood three days after MDMA administration. METHODS: Twenty-five participants (n=7 female), participated in this double-blind, repeated-measures, placebo-controlled experiment. Participants attended two acute sessions, one week apart. Each acute session was followed by a subacute session three days later. Participants received placebo (100 mg ascorbic acid) during one acute session, and MDMA (100 mg MDMA-HCl) at the other, with order counterbalanced. Participants completed the following tasks assessing prosocial behaviour: a trust investment task, a trustworthy face rating task, an empathic stories task, a public project game, a dictator game and an ultimatum game. Participants reported subjective effects. Blood was taken pre-drug, 2 and 4 hours post-drug, and tested for plasma MDMA levels. RESULTS: MDMA acutely increased self-reported 'closeness to others' and 'euphoria' and increased plasma concentrations of MDMA. MDMA did not significantly change task-based empathy, trust or cooperative behaviour. Using Bayesian analyses, we found evidence that MDMA and placebo did not differ in their effects on empathy and cooperative behaviour. MDMA did not significantly change subacute mood and this was supported by our Bayesian analyses. CONCLUSION: Despite augmentation in plasma MDMA levels and subjective drug effects, we found no increase in prosocial behaviour in a laboratory setting."

BACKGROUND: This report documents the phenomenology of the subjective experiences of 15 healthy psychedelic experienced volunteers who were involved in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study that was designed to image the brain effects of intravenous psilocybin. METHODS: The participants underwent a semi-structured interview exploring the effects of psilocybin in the MRI scanner. These interviews were analysed by Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis. The resultant data is ordered in a detailed matrix, and presented in this paper. RESULTS: Nine broad categories of phenomenology were identified in the phenomenological analysis of the experience; perceptual changes including visual, auditory and somatosensory distortions, cognitive changes, changes in mood, effects of memory, spiritual or mystical type experiences, aspects relating to the scanner and research environment, comparisons with other experiences, the intensity and onset of effects, and individual interpretation of the experience. DISCUSSION: This article documents the phenomenology of psilocybin when given in a novel manner (intravenous injection) and setting (an MRI scanner). The findings of the analysis are consistent with previous published work regarding the subjective effects of psilocybin. There is much scope for further research investigating the phenomena identified in this paper."

"1462","1","Working memory associated with anti-suicidal ideation effect of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine in depressed patients.^
Suicide is a tremendous threat to global public health, and a large number of people who committed suicide suffered the pain of mental diseases, especially major depressive disorder (MDD). Previous study showed that ketamine could reduce suicidal ideation (SI), potentially by improving the impaired working memory (WM). The objective of current study was to illuminate the relationship between WM and SI in MDD with repeated ketamine treatment. MDD patients with SI (n = 59) and without SI (n = 37) completed six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Day 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12). The severity of depressive symptoms, SI and WM were assessed at baseline, day 13 and day 26. We found that WM was significantly improved after 6 ketamine infusions (F = 161.284, p = 0.009) in a linear mixed model. Correlation analysis showed that the improvement of depressive symptom was significantly associated with WM at baseline (r =  - 0.265, p = 0.042) and the reduction in SSI-part I was related to the change of WM (r = 0.276, p = 0.034) in the MDD patients with SI. Furthermore, Logistic regression analysis showed that improvement in WM might predict the anti-SI response of ketamine. Our findings suggest that the improvement of working memory may partly account for the anti-SI effect of ketamine, and intervention of improving working memory function may be capable of reducing suicidal ideation."
"6665","1","MDMA and memory, addiction, and depression: dose-effect analysis.^
Rationale +/- 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a recreational drug that shows substantial promise as a psychotherapeutic agent. Still, there is some concern regarding its behavioral toxicity, and its dose-effect relationship is poorly understood. We previously explored the role of dose in the cognitive effects of MDMA in a systematic review of existing literature and found no evidence in animals that MDMA impairs memory at low doses (< 3 mg/kg) but mixed results at high doses (>= 3 mg/kg). Since this review comprised mostly of single-dose studies and an assortment of methodologies, an empirical dose-ranging study on this topic is warranted. Objectives The current study aims to evaluate the conclusion from our systematic review that 3 mg/kg may be the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia, and to further understand the dose-effect relationship of MDMA on behavioral assays of memory, addiction, and depression. Methods We systematically examined the effects of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg MDMA on Pavlovian fear conditioning; behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and conditioned responding; and the Porsolt forced swim test in mice. Results High doses of MDMA (>= 3 mg/kg) produced amnesia of fear conditioning memory, some evidence of an addictive potential, and antidepressant effects, while low doses of MDMA (<= 1 mg/kg) had no effect on these behaviors. Conclusions The present dose-ranging study provides further evidence that 3 mg/kg is the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia. These findings, in addition to our systematic review, demonstrate that careful selection of MDMA dose is critical. High doses (>= 3 mg/kg) should likely be avoided due to evidence that they can produce amnesia and addiction. Conversely, there is little evidence to suggest that low doses, which are usually administered in clinical studies (approximately 1-2 mg/kg), will lead to these same adverse effects. Ultra-low doses (< 1 mg/kg) are likely even safer and should be investigated for therapeutic effects in future studies."
"1762","1","Transient resolution of treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder following ketamine infusion.^
Presents a case report of a 23-year-old veteran presented to a European Army Medical Center in 2008 complaining of irritability and poor sleep, 6 months after a 15-month deployment. His platoon had been stationed at a remote outpost subject to daily bombardment, with the veteran participating in more than 300 firefights, frequent enough that he reported that by the end he dragged himself out of bed automatically at the sound of gunfire, donned gear, and numbly moved to his defensive position. He had multiple confirmed kills, watched several soldiers close to him wounded and killed, and was grazed by a sniper bullet while on guard duty. Guilt feelings became unbearable after one firefight that killed an Afghan child. Despite disillusionment and increasing psychological turmoil, he sought no treatment while in country. According to the veteran and his wife, PTSD symptoms worsened in the year after his return to Europe. He had nightly fragmented sleep of only 3 hours during which he thrashed, screamed, and had nightmares of loved ones being killed in combat, awakening drenched in sweat. Treatment was approved by the local U.S. Army medical commander and followed published protocols. After a 24-hour medication washout, the veteran was administered propofol 30 mg and ketamine 35 mg in the postanesthesia care unit over 20 minutes under the supervision of a psychiatrist and anesthesiologist. The veteran regained consciousness and experienced no side effects except transient nystagmus and visual distortions. This case report indicates that intravenous ketamine may be efficacious even for extremely treatment-resistant PTSD. Previous reports have noted that incidental perioperative ketamine decreases subsequent PTSD symptoms in burn patients but worsens them in moderately injured physical trauma survivors When given experimentally acutely after trauma, ketamine either worsened PTSD or had no effect. A Phase II trial in nontreatment-resistant PTSD is currently underway at Mount Sinai. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"

Objectives: The study presents data about age of onset of alcohol, cigarette and cannabis use and investigates the association between age of onset and later drug use patterns. Methods: Using a sample from a cross-sectional multi-site study, personal interviews were conducted with 3,503 individuals aged 12-49 years. Last-month prevalence, age of onset and associations with subsequent use patterns were investigated. Results: Having started with cannabis before the age of 16 years was associated with an odds ratio of 1.6 for heavy cannabis use. For males, the odds ratio of heavy cannabis use was 1.7, when cannabis was already initiated by the age of 16. Heavy use of ecstasy, amphetamines, hallucinogens and cocaine is associated with use of cigarettes before 13 (OR = 1.9). For males, the odds ratio was 2.2 and for women 1.9. Conclusions: Early use of alcohol, according to this data, does not seem to be related to subsequent heavy drug use. Early onset cannabis users show increasing probabilities of heavy use patterns. Preventive intervention programs have to start earlier than school-based programs normally do and specific developmental pathways need to be addressed. Copyright © 2005 S. Karger AG, Basel."

Fenfluramine had little effect on blood pressure and temperature, but caused a marked dilation of pupils, whereas amphetamine was a potent vasopressor and a weak mydriatic. While fenfluramine produced euphoria in some subjects, its overall effects were unpleasant, sedative, and qualitatively different from amphetamine. Three subjects given 240 mg of fenfluramine experienced brief but vivid hallucinogenic episodes characterized by olfactory, visual, and somatic hallucinations, abrupt polar changes in mood, time distortion, fleeting paranoia, and sexual ideation. These observations indicate that fenfluramine is a hallucinogenic agent with a pharmacologic profile in man that is not amphetamine-like."
"7672","0","'Visual snow' - a disorder distinct from persistent migraine aura.^
Patients with 'visual snow' report continuous tiny dots in the entire visual field similar to the noise of an analogue television. As they frequently have migraine as a comorbidity with ophthalmological, neurological and radiological studies being normal, they are offered various diagnoses, including persistent migraine aura, post-hallucinogen flashback, or psychogenic disorder. Our aim was to study patients with 'visual snow' to characterize the phenotype. A three-step approach was followed: (i) a chart review of patients referred to us identified 22 patients with 'visual snow'. Fifteen had additional visual symptoms, and 20 patients had comorbid migraine, five with aura; (ii) to identify systematically additional visual symptoms, an internet survey (n = 275) of self-assessed 'visual snow' subjects done by Eye On Vision Foundation was analysed. In two random samples from 235 complete data sets, the same eight additional visual symptoms were present in >33% of patients: palinopsia (trailing and afterimages), entoptic phenomena (floaters, blue field entoptic phenomenon, spontaneous photopsia, self-light of the eye), photophobia, and nyctalopia (impaired night vision); and (iii) a prospective semi-structured telephone interview in a further 142 patients identified 78 (41 female) with confirmed 'visual snow' and normal ophthalmological exams. Of these, 72 had at least three of the additional visual symptoms from step (ii). One-quarter of patients had 'visual snow' as long as they could remember, whereas for the others the mean age of onset was 21 ± 9 years. Thirty-two patients had constant visual symptoms, whereas the remainder experienced either progressive or stepwise worsening. Headache was the most frequent symptom associated with the beginning or a worsening of the visual disturbance (36%), whereas migraine aura (seven patients) and consumption of illicit drugs (five, no hallucinogens) were rare. Migraine (59%), migraine with aura (27%), anxiety and depression were common comorbidities over time. Eight patients had first degree relatives with visual snow. Clinical investigations were not contributory. Only a few treatment trials have been successful in individual patients. Our data suggest that 'visual snow' is a unique visual disturbance clinically distinct from migraine aura that can be disabling for patients. Migraine is a common concomitant although standard migraine treatments are often unhelpful. 'Visual snow' should be considered a distinct disorder and systematic studies of its clinical features, biology and treatment responses need to be commenced to begin to understand what has been an almost completely ignored problem."

Outpatient pediatric sedation is challenging. This study aimed to test intranasal dexmedeto‐midine efficacy as a single drug or combined with ketamine (DK) to sedate children undergoing dental treatment. Children < 7 years were randomized into dexmedetomidine 2 mcg/kg and ke‐tamine 1 mg/kg (DK) or dexmedetomidine 2.5 mcg/kg (D) groups. Videos from the dental sedation allowed the systematic assessment of children’s behavior (primary outcome) according to the Ohio State University Behavioral Rating Scale (OSUBRS). Secondary outcomes were parental and dentist satisfaction, adverse events, and recovery time. The data were analyzed descriptively and through regression models. Participants were 88 children (44 per group; 50 boys). The duration of quiet behavior (OSUBRS) was higher than 50% (DK mean 58.4 [standard deviation 38.1]; D 55.2 [39.1]; p = 0.225). Parents (DK 78.0 [32.2]; D 72.7 [35.1]; p = 0.203) and dentists (KD 62.7 [41.0]; D 62.8 [40.1]; p = 0.339) were overall satisfied. Adverse events occurred in 16 cases (DK n = 10, 62.5%; D n= 6, 37.5%; p = 0.104) and were minor. The median recovery time in the DK group was 1.3 times greater than in group D (p < 0.05).

"2251","0","Stress, mental disorder and ketamine as a novel, rapid acting treatment.^
The experience of stress is often utilised in models of emerging mental illness and neurobiolog-ical systems are implicated as the intermediary link between the experience of psychological stress and the development of a mental disorder. Chronic stress and prolonged glucocorticoid exposure have potent effects on neuronal architecture particularly in regions that modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and are commonly associated with psychiatric disorders. This review provides an overview of stress modulating neurobiological and neuro-chemical systems which underpin stress-related structural and functional brain changes. These changes are thought to contribute not only to the development of disorders, but also to the treatment resistance and chronicity seen in some of our most challenging mental disorders. Reports to date suggest that stress-related psychopathology is the aetiological mechanism of these disorders and thus we review the rapid acting antidepressant ketamine as an effective emerging treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is shown to induce a robust treatment effect in mental disorders via enhanced synaptic strength and connectivity in key brain regions. Whilst ketamine's glutamatergic effect has been previously examined, we further consider ketamine's capacity to modulate the HPA axis and associated pathways.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

"8253","0","Bridging the gap between the immune and glutamate hypotheses of schizophrenia and major depression: Potential role of glial NMDA receptor modulators and impaired blood-brain barrier integrity.^
Objectives. Previous studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depression involves an altered peripheral immune system. It is not clear, however, whether such changes are associated with corresponding neuroinflammatory responses and disturbances of neurotransmission. Methods. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge about the involvement of immune alterations in schizophrenia and major depression and a possible link to disturbances of glutamatergic transmission. Results. Inflammatory endogenous modulators of the NMDA receptor, the kynurenine pathway metabolites, are potential candidates for such a link. Studies of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid have suggested a schizophrenia-related upregulation of the NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in astrocytes, analogous to the ketamine psychosis model. Conversely, it has been proposed that there is depression-related microglial synthesis of the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid, which is consistent with the observation that ketamine has therapeutic effects in major depression. Few publications have studied NMDA receptor modulating kynurenines in the brain, however. Conclusions. Future research on the cerebral cell-type specific distribution of kynurenine metabolites and their brain-regional concentration imbalances will be required to connect peripheral immune changes, the hypotheses of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and glial pathology with concepts of altered neurotransmission in schizophrenia and major depression."
"4330","0","The Role of Glutamate Underlying Treatment-resistant Depression.^
The monoamine hypothesis has significantly improved our understanding of mood disorders and their treatment by linking monoaminergic abnormalities to the pathophysiology of mood disorders. Even 50 years after the monoamine hypothesis was established, some patients do not respond to treatments for depression, including selective serotonin reuptake drugs. Accumulating evidence shows that patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) have severe abnormalities in the neuroplasticity and neurotrophic factor pathways, indicating that different treatment approaches may be necessary. Therefore, the glutamate hypothesis is gaining attention as a novel hypothesis that can overcome monoamine restrictions. Glutamate has been linked to structural and maladaptive morphological alterations in several brain areas associated with mood disorders. Recently, ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, has shown efficacy in TRD treatment and has received the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, revitalizing psychiatry research. However, the mechanism by which ketamine improves TRD remains unclear. In this review, we re-examined the glutamate hypothesis, bringing the glutamate system onboard to join the modulation of the monoamine systems, emphasizing the most prominent ketamine antidepressant mechanisms, such as NMDAR inhibition and NMDAR disinhibition in GABAergic interneurons. Furthermore, we discuss the animal models used in preclinical studies and the sex differences in the effects of ketamine."
"997","1","Psychedelic effects of ketamine in healthy volunteers: relationship to steady-state plasma concentrations.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has been associated with a unique spectrum of subjective ""psychedelic"" effects in patients emerging from anesthesia. This study quantified these effects of ketamine and related them to steady-state plasma concentrations. METHODS: Ketamine or saline was administered in a single-blinded crossover protocol to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using computer-assisted continuous infusion. A stepwise series of target plasma concentrations, 0, 50, 100, 150, and 200 ng/ml were maintained for 30 min each. After 20 min at each step, the volunteers completed a visual analog (VAS) rating of 13 symptom scales. Peripheral venous plasma ketamine concentrations were determined after 28 min at each step. One hour after discontinuation of the infusion, a psychological inventory, the hallucinogen rating scale, was completed. RESULTS: The relation of mean ketamine plasma concentrations to the target concentrations was highly linear, with a correlation coefficient of R = 0.997 (P = 0.0027). Ketamine produced dose-related psychedelic effects. The relation between steady-state ketamine plasma concentration and VAS scores was highly linear for all VAS items, with linear regression coefficients ranging from R = 0.93 to 0.99 (P < 0.024 to P < 0.0005). Hallucinogen rating scale scores were similar to those found in a previous study with psychedelic doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine, an illicit LSD-25-like drug. CONCLUSIONS: Subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce psychedelic effects in healthy volunteers. The relation between steady-state venous plasma ketamine concentrations and effects is highly linear between 50 and 200 ng/ml."
"3014","0","Gender differences in prepulse inhibition (PPI) in bipolar disorder: men have reduced PPI, women have increased PPI.^
Prepulse inhibition (PPI) is a measure of sensorimotor gating or information processing. Few studies have examined PPI in bipolar disorder (BD); two studies reported a PPI disruption and two reported no change. There are gender differences in PPI and within the clinical profile of BID, which may explain some of these discrepancies. Thus, the effect of gender on PPI in BID was the focus of the current study. Euthymic BID patients (14 male/15 female) were compared to age- and IQ-matched healthy control participants (16 male/16 female). Assessment of PPI included 21 pulse-alone trials (115 dB) and a total of 42 prepulse-pulse trials (seven of each prepulse: 74, 78, 86 dB) at two stimulus onset asynchrony levels (SOA: 60, 120 ms). There was a group x SOA and a group x gender interaction, reflecting that men with BD showed reduced PPI compared to control males at the 60-ms SOA (3% in BID vs. 26% in controls), but not the 120-ms SOA. In contrast, women with BD had significantly increased PPI compared to female controls at the 120-ms SOA (49% in BID vs. 29% in controls), but not the 60-ms SOA. Compared to control participants BD patients showed changes in PPI, which are gender-dependent; male BID participants had reduced PPI, whereas female BID participants had increased PPI. This gender difference highlights the need to consider men and women with BID as two distinct groups, at least in PPI studies."

Optimizing Set and Setting for the psilocybin experience may improve outcomes without requiring higher drug doses. The current study will complete a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing Set and Setting (N=10) versus standard Set and Setting procedures (N=10) in participants with alcohol use disorder undergoing open‐label psilocybin 25 mg therapy. In the Visual Healing condition, participants will view nature‐themed video programs during the Prep session and during the Ascent phase of the psilocybin experience. Anecdotal reports and reviews suggest that viewing Visual Healing creates a tranquil and calming environment that fosters a stronger connection between the viewer and nature. Psilocybin increases the users feeling of connection to nature and having an intention to connect with nature during the psychedelic session is associated with better outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy in initial studies. Reducing pre‐dosing anxiety/apprehension and enhancing connections to nature with Visual Healing may improve outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy without the need for higher psilocybin doses."
"8715","1","Migraine prevalence in visual snow with prior illicit drug use (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder) versus without.^
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to investigate migraine prevalence in persons with hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) presenting as visual snow syndrome (VSS). METHODS: Persons with visual snow as a persisting symptom after illicit drug use (HPPD) were recruited via a Dutch consulting clinic for recreational drug use. A structured interview on (visual) perceptual symptomatology, details of drugs use, and medical and headache history was taken. As a control group, persons with visual snow who had never used illicit drugs prior to onset were included. The primary outcome was lifetime prevalence of migraine. Symptom severity was evaluated by the Visual Snow Handicap Inventory (VHI), a 25-item questionnaire. RESULTS: None of the 24 HPPD participants had migraine, whereas 20 of 37 (54.1%) controls had migraine (p < 0.001). VHI scores did not differ significantly between the two groups; in both groups, the median score was 38 of 100. In most HPPD cases (17/24, 70.9%), visual snow had started after intake of ecstasy; other psychedelic drugs reported included cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, amphetamine, 4-fluoroamphetamine, 3-methylmethcathinone, 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxypenethylamine, and nitrous oxide. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas none of the HPPD participants had migraine, more than half of the visual snow controls without prior use of illicit drugs had migraine. This suggests that at least partly different pathophysiological factors play a role in these disorders. Users of ecstasy and other hallucinogens should be warned of the risk of visual snow. Further studies are needed to enhance understanding of the underlying neurobiology of HPPD and VSS to enable better management of these conditions."
"4625","0","Brief interventions for young adults who use drugs: The moderating effects of resilience and trauma.^
Among participants in an intervention clinical trial (N = 602), we examined resilience as a moderator of substance use outcomes by intervention condition and between participants with and without severe traumatic stress (STS). Eligibility included men and women ages 18-39 with recent multidrug use; drug treatment enrollees were excluded. Outcome measures were past 90-day frequencies of substance use and abstinence. Putative moderators were measured using the Resilience Research Centres Adult Resilience Measure (RRC-ARM) and the Traumatic Stress Scale from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN). Analyses employed hierarchical linear models. High resilience predicted better substance use outcomes, and the ordering of intervention effects for high resilience participants was stepwise by intervention condition intensity. Participants with low resilience scores had poorer outcomes, and those outcomes were largely unaffected by intervention condition. Participants without STS experienced the interventions similarly to the overall sample. Regardless of the level of resilience, however, participants with STS did not benefit from the interventions. The findings point to the importance of screening for both resilience and traumatic stress prior to intervention to maximize the impact of brief interventions for substance users, and also to link those needing more intensive approaches to additional services and professional care."
"3101","1","Effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin on habituation and prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex in humans.^
Schizophrenic patients exhibit deficits in indices of sensorimotor gating, such as habituation and prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the startle reflex. Hallucinogenic drug-induced states are putative models for the early and acute stages of schizophrenic and schizophrenia-spectrum disorders. Hallucinogenic drugs have been shown to disrupt PPI and/or retard habituation of the startle reflex in animal models of schizophrenia, consistent with the view of hallucinogen-induced states as 'model psychoses'. We evaluated the effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin on PPI and habituation of the startle reflex in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human study with 12 healthy subjects. In contrast to animal studies, in our small human sample, psilocybin increased PPI, while having no clear effect on habituation (n = 6). These findings must be considered preliminary because several factors, including dose regimens and experimental parameters, may influence the results of studies on startle plasticity. Further investigations both with psychotic patients in different stages of the disease and with human and animal models of schizophrenia are needed in order to explore the effects of hallucinogens on sensorimotor gating and the relationship between information processing in hallucinogenic drug-induced states and the naturally occurring psychoses."
"7303","0","MDMA-Based Psychotherapy in Treatment-Resistant Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Brief Narrative Overview of Current Evidence.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that causes significant dysfunction in individuals. Currently, there are many approved pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatment options for PTSD, but unfortunately, half of the patients do not respond to traditional therapies. In this article, we review clinical trials and research on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in PTSD patients, its pharmacokinetics, and current treatment guidelines for PTSD. Our findings are based on the results of the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy from six phase II randomized controlled trials. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD has received the ""breakthrough therapy"" designation from the FDA. MDMA can reduce PTSD symptoms even in treatment-resistant cases by increasing certain neurohormones, i.e., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and oxytocin. It also modulates activities in the brain regions involved in fear and anxiety. Future research is needed to show whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and whether its use can be integrated into available treatment options for PTSD."
"1142","1","Transcriptomics-informed large-scale cortical model captures topography of pharmacological neuroimaging effects of LSD.^
Psychoactive drugs can transiently perturb brain physiology while preserving brain structure. The role of physiological state in shaping neural function can therefore be investigated through neuroimaging of pharmacologically induced effects. Previously, using pharmacological neuroimaging, we found that neural and experiential effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are attributable to agonism of the serotonin-2A receptor (Preller et al., 2018). Here, we integrate brain-wide transcriptomics with biophysically based circuit modeling to simulate acute neuromodulatory effects of LSD on human cortical large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics. Our model captures the inter-areal topography of LSD-induced changes in cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional connectivity. These findings suggest that serotonin-2A-mediated modulation of pyramidal-neuronal gain is a circuit mechanism through which LSD alters cortical functional topography. Individual-subject model fitting captures patterns of individual neural differences in pharmacological response related to altered states of consciousness. This work establishes a framework for linking molecular-level manipulations to systems-level functional alterations, with implications for precision medicine."
"7293","1","The perceptions of cancer health-care practitioners in New Zealand and the USA toward psychedelic-assisted therapy with cancer patients: A cross-sectional survey.^
OBJECTIVES: A resurgence of research investigating the administration of psychedelic compounds alongside psychotherapy suggests that this treatment is a promising intervention for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with cancer. However, psychedelic treatment that induces a mind-altering experience potentially poses barriers to vulnerable cancer patients, and health-care practitioners may have concerns about referring their patients to trials investigating this approach. The aim of the current study was to investigate the perceptions of cancer health-care practitioners based in New Zealand and the USA related to psychedelic-assisted therapy. METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of cancer health-care practitioners in New Zealand and the USA via convenience sampling to identify their perceptions about the concept of conducting psychedelic-assisted therapy with cancer patients. RESULTS: Participants perceived that (1) psychedelic-assisted therapy has the potential to provide benefit for cancer patients, (2) research in this area across a variety of domains is important, (3) work should consider spiritual and indigenous perspectives of health, and (4) there was willingness to refer patients to trials in this area, especially patients with advanced disease who were no longer going through curative treatment. Participants in the USA had greater awareness of psychedelics than the New Zealand sample; however, New Zealand participants more strongly believed that spiritual/indigenous factors should be considered in psychedelic-assisted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Cancer health-care practitioners in our sample considered research investigating the potential for psychedelic-assisted therapies to be important and may be more open to studies that start in palliative and end-of-life contexts."
"4522","1","Evaluating global brain connectivity as an imaging marker for depression: influence of preprocessing strategies and placebo-controlled ketamine treatment.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity (GBC), as assessed via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations of GBC as a putative imaging marker. These results were obtained via global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: (1) regression of white matter (WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); (2) WM/CSF + GSR (GSR); and (3) WM/CSF + physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Reduced GBC was observed in individuals with MDD only at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as in the prefrontal cortex only after regressing the global signal. Ketamine had no effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group in any pipeline. PHYSIO did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR. These results concur with several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Further investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD."
"6468","1","Antidepressant effects of a psychedelic experience in a large prospective naturalistic sample.^
BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, a number of studies have highlighted the potential of psychedelic therapy. However, questions remain to what extend these results translate to naturalistic samples, and how contextual factors and the acute psychedelic experience relate to improvements in affective symptoms following psychedelic experiences outside labs/clinics. The present study sought to address this knowledge gap. AIM: Here, we aimed to investigate changes in anxiety and depression scores before versus after psychedelic experiences in naturalistic contexts, and how various pharmacological, extrapharmacological and experience factors related to outcomes. METHOD: Individuals who planned to undergo a psychedelic experience were enrolled in this online survey study. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks post-psychedelic experience, with self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16) as the primary outcome. To facilitate clinical translation, only participants with depressive symptoms at baseline were included. Sample sizes for the four time points were N = 302, N = 182, N = 155 and N = 109, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, reductions in depressive symptoms were observed at 2 and 4 weeks. A medicinal motive, previous psychedelic use, drug dose and the type of acute psychedelic experience (i.e. specifically, having an emotional breakthrough) were all significantly associated with changes in self-rated QIDS-SR-16. CONCLUSION: These results lend support to therapeutic potential of psychedelics and highlight the influence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors in determining response. Mindful of a potential sample and attrition bias, further controlled and observational longitudinal studies are needed to test the replicability of these findings."
"8923","1","Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm. FUNDING: The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute."
"189","0","Recovery and aging of serotonergic fibers after single and intermittent MDMA treatment in Dark Agouti rat.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a popular party drug known to cause selective serotonergic damage. Here we examined the long-term recovery and aging of serotonergic fibers and levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) after intermittent MDMA administration (15 mg kg(-1) i.p. every 7th day for 4 weeks, MDMA ×4) and a single-dose treatment (15 mg kg(-1) i.p., MDMA ×1) in adolescent/young adult male Dark Agouti rats. After MDMA treatment, tryptophan hydroxylase-immunoreactive fiber density decreased and then recovered in all brain regions. Recovery was more pronounced in the MDMA ×4 group compared with the MDMA ×1 group, but similar long-term BDNF responses were found after both treatments. Twenty-two months after treatment, there were fewer clusters of aberrant serotonergic fibers in the parietal cortex in the MDMA ×4 group compared with the MDMA ×1 group. There was no difference in the density of microglial cells or astrocytes in treated groups versus the control 22 months after the treatments. These results indicate that recovery of serotonergic fibers is faster after intermittent MDMA treatment than after single-dose administration, and differences in BDNF levels per se are unlikely to account for this difference. Moreover, it seems that intermittent MDMA treatment attenuates the morphological signs of aging in serotonergic fibers. In addition, neither intermittent nor single-dose MDMA exposition of young animals induces accelerated aging processes or neurodegeneration in senescence, as indicated by the unaltered densities of microglial cells and astrocytes in the treated groups compared with the control."
"8087","1","A single-infusion of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine improves fatigue scores in patients with bipolar disorder compared to placebo.^
Background: Fatigue is a highly prevalent residual symptom of depression that is difficult to treat with current monoaminergic antidepressants. Research has shown that ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that manipulates the glutamate system, produces rapid, robust, and moderately sustained improvements in depressive symptoms. However, there is a dearth of literature examining the effects of ketamine on fatigue specifically. We hypothesized that ketamine would rapidly improve fatigue symptoms in treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, crossover study, 36 participants with treatment‐resistant bipolar depression (maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate) received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride at a dose of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes or placebo on 2 experimental days separated by 2 weeks. A post‐hoc analysis compared fatigue scores on ketamine vs. placebo from 40 minutes through 14 days using a novel scale (based on questions from validated rating scales). Results: A linear mixed model showed that patients had significantly lower fatigue scores following ketamine compared to placebo from 40 minutes (p=.002) through day 3 (p<.001). The drug difference was not significant at day 7 (p=.10), but it was at day 10 (p=.03) and 14 (p=.004). The largest difference was at day 2 (p<.001; d=.58). Conclusions: Ketamine rapidly and significantly improved fatigue symptoms relative to placebo in a group of treatment‐resistant bipolar depressed patients. Unlike current monoaminergic antidepressants that fail to alleviate fatigue in depression, the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine may provide swift and robust improvements to fatigue in depressed patients."

The effect of LSD-25 on 2 dimensions of verbal behavior, predictability and volubility, was examined. 100-word samples of spontaneous speech from 10 alcoholic Ss under 4 drug conditions (predrug, 100μg., 200μg., postdrug) were elicited. 100 normal raters were asked to fill in every 5th-deleted word of the speech samples, all raters completing a set of 4 samples from randomly ordered Ss. The communicative value of speech (ratio of total to correct guesses) was found to decrease under LSD, as did volubility (number of words spoken). Additionally, an inverse relationship between predictability and volubility under the drug was suggested. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"

Despite the availability of numerous anecdotal reports of polydrug use in kratom users, few studies have been carried out in Thailand. This study aimed to explore the problem of polydrug use among Thai kratom users. A national household survey on the prevalence of substance use was conducted in 2011 using a multistage random sampling technique. Participants were interviewed using a structured questionnaire. The frequency of other substance use was compared between respondents with and without a history of kratom use. Of the total sample (18,457), 544 (2.9%) acknowledged kratom use. Eighty-nine (46.1%) used it almost every day. The mean age of users (SD) was 42.7 (12.8) years old, 459 (84.4%) were male, and 264 (48.5%) had used other illicit drugs in the past. Kratom users were significantly more likely to use heroin, ecstasy, and ice with adjusted odds ratios of 39.7, 30.5, and 29.1, respectively. Of 195 who acknowledged kratom use in the past 12 months, 22 (11.3%) concurrently used other illicit drugs, including cannabis, amphetamine-type stimulants (ATSs), and inhalants. Polydrug use is common in Thai kratom users who are more likely to use opiates and ATSs in their lifetime. Another drug concurrently used was cannabis. Health personnel need to be aware of polydrug use in this population."
"3339","0","Essay: Hallucinogen abuse and dependence.^
Hallucinogen abuse and dependence are known complications resulting from the illicit use of drugs in this category, such as LSD and psilocybin. Users do not experience withdrawal symptoms, but the general criteria for substance abuse and dependence otherwise apply. Dependence is estimated in approximately 2% of recent-onset users in the United States. Acute hallucinogen intoxication may induce a plethora of physical and psychological effects that can become so overwhelming to the user as to result in seeking emergency psychiatric care. Providing supportive psychotherapy usually proves effective, though sometimes the use of a sedative hypnotic for anxiety is indicated in addition. No randomized controlled trials have examined treatments of hallucinogen abuse or dependence, but standard treatments (motivational interviewing, relapse prevention, outpatient counseling, participation in self-help groups, family therapy) should still be offered.

"8751","1","Intravenous esketamine leads to an increase in impulsive and suicidal behaviour in a patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder.^
Objectives: As clinical studies demonstrated that ketamine possesses rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, it is increasingly used in affective disorders. The neuroplastic properties of ketamine are well described in preclinical and imaging studies, and are highly related to its antidepressive mechanism of action.Methods: Here, we report on a female patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD) who was treated with intravenous (i.v.) esketamine as rapid-acting augmentation therapy to improve severe and acute depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour.Results: Esketamine led to an initial improvement of these symptoms. However, during the course of treatment, loosened and disinhibited behaviour and severe suicidal ideation occurred during and immediately after esketamine application. Hence, i.v. esketamine was discontinued, and she further received treatment as usual, which demonstrated to be beneficial.Conclusions: With current knowledge at hand, one cannot exclude esketamine's effects on the equilibrium of neural plasticity in brain networks, potentially initiating undesirable symptoms as impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. Therefore, until investigations focus on efficacy and side effects profile of esketamine in depressed patients with (comorbid) BPD, treatment with this fast-acting medication should be considered with caution in this patient group."
"9331","1","The acute antisuicidal effects of single-dose intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine in individuals with major depression and bipolar disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
The efficacy of ketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI) has been previously reported. We aimed to evaluate acute anti-SI effects of single-dose ketamine in different formulations/routes of administration by pooling results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was conducted on Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and PubMed from inception to July 1st, 2020. Studies were selected based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Effect sizes of different formulations/routes at various time points were computed using random-effects models. With data from nine eligible RCTs (n = 197), the pooled effect size for anti-SI effects at the 24-h time point was 1.035 (N = 6, CI: 0.793 to 1.277, p < 0.001) for intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine and 1.309 (N = 1, CI: 0.857 to 1.761, p < 0.001) for intranasal (IN) esketamine. An additional five RCTs were available for qualitative analysis. RCTs were identified for oral/sublingual ketamine for depression, however, none of these trials reported anti-SI effects preventing quantitative analysis for these routes of delivery. No RCTs for intramuscular (IM) ketamine were identified. The findings suggest that single-dose IV ketamine/IN esketamine is associated with robust reductions in suicidal thoughts at 2-h, 4-h, and 24-h post-intervention. In addition, future studies on IM/oral/sublingual ketamine and comparative studies are warranted to evaluate the anti-SI efficacy of distinct formulations and routes of administration."
"3666","0","Evaluation of relatively low dose of oral transmucosal ketamine premedication in children: a comparison with oral midazolam.^
BACKGROUND: Oral Transmucosal ketamine (lollipop) has been shown to be an effective, harmless preoperative medication for children. However, its efficacy was not compared with commonly used premedication drugs. We, therefore, compared the efficacy of oral transmucosal ketamine with oral midazolam for premedication in children. METHODS: Fifty-five children (2-6 years of age) were randomized to receive orally either a lollipop containing 50 mg of ketamine (the group K; n = 27) or syrup containing 0.5 mg.kg(-1) of midazolam (the group M; n = 28) before minor surgery. A five points-sedation score (1 = asleep to 5 = agitated; scores 2 and 3 were defined as 'effective') on arrival in the operating room and a three points-acceptance score of separation from the parents and a three points-mask cooperation score at induction of anesthesia (1 = easy to 3 = markedly resistant; score 3 was defined as 'poor') were used. RESULTS: Sedation scores in group K were significantly higher than those in group M (P = 0.012), and the incidence of 'effective' in sedation was significantly lower in group K than in group M (P = 0.036). The incidence of 'poor' at separation from the parents and for mask cooperation was significantly higher in group K than in group M (P = 0.017, P = 0.019, respectively). CONCLUSION: These results indicate that a relatively low dose of oral transmucosal ketamine premedication provides no benefits over oral midazolam in children."
"633","1","Ketamine-Associated Intraoperative Electroencephalographic Signatures of Elderly Patients With and Without Preoperative Cognitive Impairment.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is typically used by anesthesiologists as an adjunct for general anesthesia and as a nonopioid analgesic. It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged ≥65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for ≥3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine."
"8611","1","Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The synergic modulation of inflammatory and VEGF systems may contribute to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.

"7304","1","Effects of the South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca on regional brain electrical activity in humans: a functional neuroimaging study using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography.^
Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines monoamine oxidase-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids with N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic agent showing 5-HT(2A) agonist activity. In a clinical research setting, ayahuasca has demonstrated a combined stimulatory and psychedelic effect profile, as measured by subjective effect self-assessment instruments and dose-dependent changes in spontaneous brain electrical activity, which parallel the time course of subjective effects. In the present study, the spatial distribution of ayahuasca-induced changes in brain electrical activity was investigated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Electroencephalography recordings were obtained from 18 volunteers after the administration of a dose of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca containing 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight and placebo. The intracerebral power density distribution was computed with LORETA from spectrally analyzed data, and subjective effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for LORETA power 60 and 90 min after dosing, together with increases in all six scales of the HRS. Ayahuasca decreased power density in the alpha-2, delta, theta and beta-1 frequency bands. Power decreases in the delta, alpha-2 and beta-1 bands were found predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, whereas theta power was reduced in the temporomedial cortex and in frontomedial regions. The present results suggest the involvement of unimodal and heteromodal association cortex and limbic structures in the psychological effects elicited by ayahuasca."

"4285","0","Clinical characteristics and outcomes using dexmedetomidine in nonintubated patients: A poison center observational study.^
PURPOSE: Dexmedetomidine is a central α2 agonist commonly used on intubated patients. It is increasingly being used off-label in nonintubated agitated patients. We sought to determine the overall clinical course, adverse effects, and need for subsequent mechanical ventilation in toxicology patients after treatment with dexmedetomidine. METHODS: This was a retrospective cohort study conducted by chart review of electronic records from the Virginia Poison Control Center from January 1, 2019 to February 4, 2022. Inclusion criteria consisted of all poison center cases where dexmedetomidine was used. The primary outcome was the presence or absence of clinical improvement following dexmedetomidine use. Secondary outcomes included adverse effects, subsequent intubation, or death. RESULTS: During this study period, there were 220 cases in which dexmedetomidine was used to treat agitation. After exclusions, 70 cases were analyzed. The categories included antimuscarinic (n = 19), polysubstance (n = 16), sedative withdrawal (n = 10), unknown agitation (n = 7), sympathomimetic (n = 5), baclofen withdrawal (n = 3), unknown ingestion (n = 3), sedative/hypnotic (n = 2), antipsychotic (n = 2), hallucinogenic (n = 2), and opioid withdrawal (n = 1). Clinical improvement occurred in 62 of 70 patients (89%). There were no deaths. A total of 4 patients were intubated after starting dexmedetomidine, 2 for refractory agitation and 2 for hypoxia after aspiration. CONCLUSION: Global clinical improvement was observed in the agitated toxicology patients administered dexmedetomidine. There was one case of intubation secondary to oversedation. Dexmedetomidine could be a useful adjunctive treatment for agitated toxicologic patients but should be studied further before routinely used."
"496","1","Efficacy and safety of ketamine in patients with complex regional pain syndrome: A systematic review.^
Despite being a recognized clinical entity for over 140 years, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains a difficult-to-treat condition. While there have been multiple therapies explored in the treatment of CRPS, NMDA antagonists such as ketamine continue to hold significant interest because of their potential ability to alter the central sensitization noted in chronic pain states. The objective of this review is to identify published literature for evidence of the efficacy and safety of ketamine in the treatment of CRPS. PubMed and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (final search 26 May 2011) using the MeSH terms ‘ketamine’, ‘complex regional pain syndrome’, ‘analgesia’ and ‘pain’ in the English literature. The manuscript bibliographies were then reviewed to identify additional relevant papers. Observational trials were evaluated using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria; randomized trials were evaluated using the methodological assessment of randomized clinical trials. The search methodology yielded three randomized, placebo-controlled trials, seven observational studies and nine case studies/reports. In aggregate, the data available reveal ketamine as a promising treatment for CRPS. The optimum dose, route and timing of administration remain to be determined. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of ketamine and to determine its long-term benefit in CRPS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"2207","1","Long term structural and functional neural changes following a single infusion of Ketamine in PTSD.^
NMDA receptor antagonists have a vital role in extinction, learning, and reconsolidation processes. During the reconsolidation window, memories are activated into a labile state and can be reconsolidated in an altered form. This concept might have significant clinical implications in treating PTSD. In this pilot study we tested the potential of a single infusion of ketamine, followed by brief exposure therapy, to enhance post-retrieval extinction of PTSD trauma memories. 27 individuals diagnosed with PTSD were randomly assigned to receive either ketamine (0.5 mg/kg 40 min; N = 14) or midazolam (0.045 mg/kg; N = 13) after retrieval of the traumatic memory. 24 h following infusion, participants received a four-day trauma-focused psychotherapy. Symptoms and brain activity were assessed before treatment, at the end of treatment, and at 30-day follow-up. Amygdala activation to trauma scripts (a major biomarker of fear response) served as the main study outcome. Although PTSD symptoms improved equally in both groups, post-treatment, ketamine recipients showed a lower amygdala (-0.33, sd = 0.13, 95%HDI [-0.56,-0.04]) and hippocampus (-0.3 (sd = 0.19), 95%HDI [-0.65, 0.04]; marginal effect) reactivation to trauma memories, compared to midazolam recipients. Post-retrieval ketamine administration was also associated with decreased connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus (-0.28, sd = 0.11, 95%HDI [-0.46, -0.11]), with no change in amygdala-vmPFC connectivity. Moreover, reduction in fractional anisotropy in bi-lateral uncinate fasciculus was seen in the Ketamine recipients compared with the midazolam recipients (right: post-treatment: -0.01108, 95% HDI [-0.0184,-0.003]; follow-up: -0.0183, 95% HDI [-0.02719,-0.0107]; left: post-treatment: -0.019, 95% HDI [-0.028,-0.011]; follow-up: -0.017, 95% HDI [-0.026,-0.007]). Taken together it is possible that ketamine may enhance post-retrieval extinction of the original trauma memories in humans. These preliminary findings show promising direction toward the capacity to rewrite human traumatic memories and modulate the fear response for at least 30 days post-extinction. When combined with psychotherapy for PTSD, further investigation of ketamine dose, timing of administration, and frequency of administration, is warranted."
"2092","1","Cardiac Safety of Esketamine Nasal Spray in Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results from the Clinical Development Program.^
BACKGROUND: An intranasal formulation of esketamine, combined with an oral antidepressant, is approved in the USA and the European Union for adults with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Transient cardiovascular stimulatory effects have been reported with ketamine. METHODS: Cardiovascular effects of esketamine nasal spray, combined with an oral antidepressant, were evaluated in 1708 esketamine-treated adults with TRD in six trials (five double-blind, placebo-controlled (486 placebo-treated patients); one open-label) of 4-52 weeks' duration. Patients with established cardiovascular disease, including uncontrolled hypertension (> 140/> 90 mmHg), history of hypertensive crisis, or clinically significant electrocardiogram (ECG) abnormalities, were excluded from enrollment. Effects on cardiac repolarization were assessed in a phase I randomized, positive- and active-controlled thorough corrected QT (QTc) interval study. For adverse events, odds ratio (OR) [95% confidence interval] for esketamine/antidepressant versus antidepressant/placebo was calculated. RESULTS: Adverse events related to increased BP were reported in 12.8% of all esketamine-treated patients (in double-blind trials: esketamine/antidepressant 11.6% vs. antidepressant/placebo 3.9%; OR 3.2 [1.9-5.8]). Among the patients without a history of hypertension, new antihypertensive medication was initiated by 2.1% (6/280) of patients in the esketamine/antidepressant group versus 1.2% (2/171) of patients in the antidepressant/placebo group, in the double-blinded studies. Adverse events related to abnormal heart rate were reported in 3.0% of all esketamine-treated patients (in double-blind trials: 1.6% vs. 0.8%; OR 1.9 [0.5-8.6]). Overall, three cardiovascular adverse events related to BP increase were reported as serious and severe, and there was one fatal event considered unrelated (acute cardiac failure). BP increases reached the maximum postdose value within ~ 40 min of esketamine dosing and returned to the predose range by ~ 1.5 h postdose. In two studies (4-week duration, age 18-64 years), the largest mean maximum systolic/diastolic postdose BP increases were 13.3/8.7 mmHg for esketamine/antidepressant and 6.1/4.9 mmHg for antidepressant/placebo, and in a short-term elderly study (age ≥ 65 years) were 16.0/9.5 and 11.1/6.8 mmHg, respectively. Across studies/study phases, < 2% of patients discontinued esketamine due to adverse events of increased BP and tachycardia. No clinically relevant effect on ECG parameters was observed. Therapeutic and supratherapeutic doses of esketamine did not prolong the QTcF (QT corrected by Fridericia's equation) interval (baseline-corrected values of - 2.02 to 2.16 ms, and - 3.51 to 4.89 ms, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: BP elevations following esketamine dosing are generally transient, asymptomatic, and not associated with serious cardiovascular safety sequalae. Further evaluation of long-term cardiovascular outcomes is warranted."

Administered the Defense Mechanism Test (DMT) to 57 psychiatric outpatients and 99 normal controls. In the DMT, stimuli representing a central figure threatened by a peripheral person are presented tachistoscopically, at increasing exposure times. The threat is assumed to trigger defense mechanisms expressed by perceptual distortions. Significantly more patients than controls were coded for presence of each of the 10 main defensive signs. 10 codings or subcodings of defense that were rare in the control sample were employed to discriminate between groups. This procedure correctly allocated 85.8% of the control Ss and 85.9% of the psychiatric patients. Findings provide a construct validation for most of the signs, and sign variants of the DMT and should represent an aid for its psychodiagnostic use, as they facilitate a more efficient and less demanding coding.

"7521","1","Psilocybin administration to healthy participants: safety and feasibility in a placebo-controlled study.^
Background: Treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) remains a significant unmet medical need. From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI), Symptom Checklist‐90 item (SCL‐90), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18‐35 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D‐ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019. Four strata were populated, (males 18‐35) n = 24; (males 35+) n = 24; (females 18‐35) n = 23; (females 35+) n = 18. 38% of the participants had prior psilocybin experience. A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed, with up to 6 participants per session (2 sessions with 1 participant, 3 with 2 participants, 5 with 3 participants, 11 with 4, 2 with 5, and, 2 ith 6). In the simultaneous administration sessions, each participant was supported by an assisting therapist, overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist. During this study, 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies. Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences. The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists. Additionally, simultaneous administration to up to 6 volunteers was shown to be feasible in this population."

They will be oiled. after approval, the prepared oil will be provided to Tak Pars Rokh Company to make gelatin capsules so that 1.1 gram sesame oil capsules can be prepared in gelatinous form.Due to the fact that a similar study was not performed for afterpains or labor pain and sesame oil, the study of Montiro et al. (2014) which investigated the anti‐inflammatory effects of sesame oil on rats was used. In this study, doses of 100,200,400 Mg / kg of sesame oil was used orally for rats and 60 minutes before the start of HOTEPLATE test, which was effective in reducing pain in rats.Also according to the study of Nayr et al. (2016) and the formula for converting animal dose to human: Equivalent human dose (in mg / kg) = effective animal dose * (animal communication factor / human communication factor) that the numbers in the above equation are as follows: Be: Effective animal dose: 400 mg / kg based on the study of Montiro et al. Above: (37.6) * 400 = 64.86 and approximately 65 mg / kg, so if we consider an average of 70 kg of a human being, the permissible dose prescribed to a person is 4550 mg / kg in 24 hours.Therefore, considering that this dose is prescribed every 6 hours (4 doses in 24 hours), the number obtained was divided by 4: 1137 mg is obtained each time of administration.

Timepoint: Two hours after delivery, gelatin capsules of sesame oil or placebo are given to the mother every 6 hours, and the severity of back pain is measured one hour after each dose. Method of measurement: To measure the intensity of pain, the painometer‐visual analogue scale index, which is one of the parts of the painometer tool, will be used. It will be drawn 100 mm linearly and the left side of the number zero means painless and the right side of the number 10 means maximum pain. The mother is asked to mark the intensity of her lower abdominal pain on the line at that moment. SECONDARY OUTCOME: The quality of the afterpains. Timepoint: Two hours after delivery, gelatin capsules of sesame oil or placebo are given to the mother every 6 hours, and the quality of the afterpains is measured one hour after each dose. Method of measurement: To evaluate the quality of pain, the word description scale index, which is one of the parts of the painometer tool, will be used. This index is used to evaluate the quality of pain and consists of two parts. 11 items are sensory description words and 14 physical description words of pain. The mother will complete this form every 6 hours (4 times in total) one hour after receiving each dose of medication.The mother can mark any number of words she wants and the words will be assigned scores between 1 and 5 depending on their type and intensity. The sum of the maximum scores of the physical description items of pain is 47 and the sum of the maximum scores of the items of sensory description of pain is 37. Finally, the points related to the marked words are added together and the result, which varies between 2 and 84, evaluates the score of the quality of the mother's pain.

BACKGROUND: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans are at increased risk for a variety of mental health problems and cognitive impairment associated with military service. Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. METHOD: We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). RESULTS: Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.Limitations: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. CONCLUSION: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population. However, controlled studies are needed to determine whether this treatment is efficacious in relieving mental health and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans."
"7235","1","Ecstasy and Gateway Drugs: Initiating the Use of Ecstasy and Other Drugs.^
Purpose: The main purposes of this study are to examine whether and to what extent ecstasy use serves as a gateway to the use of such hard drugs as cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine and compare ages of onset of alcohol and marijuana use and subsequent use of cocaine, heroin, and methamphetamine among young adult ecstasy users. Methods: Face-to-face surveys were conducted with 268 young adult ecstasy users in Atlanta, GA. Subjects were solicited by using the community identification process, including targeted sampling and guided recruitment. Data analysis involved discrete-time event-history analysis. Results: Results suggest that age of onset of ecstasy use influences the initiation of cocaine and methamphetamine use for our sample of active ecstasy users. In addition, alcohol and marijuana use precedes the initiation of cocaine and methamphetamine use, but only marijuana use influences the initiation of heroin use. Conclusions: The sequential progression of drug use proposed in the gateway literature is not immutable. Researchers must take into account the changing popularity of drugs over time, such as the emergence of ecstasy use, when identifying patterns of drug-use onset. © 2006 Elsevier Inc.

"9482","0","What should be done when elderly patients with major depression have failed to respond to all treatments?.^
Comments on an article by Duncan George et al. (see record [rid]2017-48381-011[/rid]). Although major depressive disorder (MDD) in older adults is common and can be effectively treated with antidepressants or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), few treatment options exist for those who have not responded to established treatments. This is where the study by George et al. becomes highly relevant. The study was designed to address a serious problem in this special population: how to treat MDD in patients who have failed to respond to existing standard treatments, particularly those who may be frail and are at considerable risk for suicide. George et al. conducted a double-blind, randomized, multiple crossover, controlled trial of different subcutaneous doses of ketamine in individuals over age 60 years with MDD. An ascending dose schedule was used, and subcutaneous injections were administered 1 week apart. A single dose of midazolam was used as an active control. In this study subjects were quite severely treatment-resistant. Their average current major depressive episode had lasted 9 years, they had failed to respond to a mean of four antidepressant trials over the course of their current major depressive episode, and they had an average of eight lifetime antidepressant trials. Notably, the authors found that single doses of subcutaneously administered ketamine in older patients were effective, safe, and well tolerated. Across all dose levels and time points, 11 participants (69%) met criteria for both response and remission after ketamine administration during at least one of the trial’s timepoints. Furthermore, the proportion of the entire sample who met remission criteria improved as the ketamine dose was increased from 0.1 mg/kg to 0.5 mg/kg. In addition, repeated treatments resulted in a higher chance of remission or a longer time to relapse. The investigators also found that five patients remitted at doses below 0.5 mg/kg and that doses of at least 0.2 mg/kg were significantly more effective than midazolam. 1 Although this was a pilot study whose results cannot yet be generalized to 'real-world' patients, it does offer exciting insights into how ketamine might enter existing treatment algorithms and how it might be placed in a hierarchy compared with other treatments. Although these results are very promising, several cautionary issues bear mention. First, the findings of George et al. are preliminary and need to be replicated in a much larger sample before any firm conclusions can be made. Second, even if replicable, these findings may not necessarily generalize to other populations, such as those who are acutely suicidal, inpatients, or particularly frail individuals. Until such studies are conducted, concerted efforts to gather systematic data on the use of ketamine across all ages should continue, as should efforts to translate such information for practical clinical use. Relatedly, ongoing, well-controlled, long-term trials are needed to address questions of efficacy, tolerability, safety, and effectiveness across patient populations.

"2354","0","Connecting inflammation with glutamate agonism in suicidality.^
The NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine has proven efficient in reducing symptoms of suicidality, although the mechanisms explaining this effect have not been detailed in psychiatric patients. Recent evidence points towards a low-grade inflammation in brains of suicide victims. Inflammation leads to production of quinolinic acid (QUIN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA), an agonist and antagonist of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively. We here measured QUIN and KYNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 64 medication-free suicide attempters and 36 controls, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We assessed the patients clinically using the Suicide Intent Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We found that QUIN, but not KYNA, was significantly elevated in the CSF of suicide attempters (P<0.001). As predicted, the increase in QUIN was associated with higher levels of CSF interleukin-6. Moreover, QUIN levels correlated with the total scores on Suicide Intent Scale. There was a significant decrease of QUIN in patients who came for follow-up lumbar punctures within 6 months after the suicide attempt. In summary, we here present clinical evidence of increased QUIN in the CSF of suicide attempters. An increased QUIN/KYNA quotient speaks in favor of an overall NMDA-receptor stimulation. The correlation between QUIN and the Suicide Intent Scale indicates that changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission could be specifically linked to suicidality. Our findings have important implications for the detection and specific treatment of suicidal patients, and might explain the observed remedial effects of ketamine. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"5159","1","Increased nature relatedness and decreased authoritarian political views after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^
RATIONALE: Previous research suggests that classical psychedelic compounds can induce lasting changes in personality traits, attitudes and beliefs in both healthy subjects and patient populations. AIM: Here we sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD ( n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects ( n=7). Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 7-12 months after the second dosing session. Nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective were assessed using the Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6) and Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5), respectively. RESULTS: Nature relatedness significantly increased ( t(6)=-4.242, p=0.003) and authoritarianism significantly decreased ( t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) for the patients 1 week after the dosing sessions. At 7-12 months post-dosing, nature relatedness remained significantly increased ( t(5)=-2.707, p=0.021) and authoritarianism remained decreased at trend level ( t(5)=-1.811, p=0.065). No differences were found on either measure for the non-treated healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that psilocybin with psychological support might produce lasting changes in attitudes and beliefs. Although it would be premature to infer causality from this small study, the possibility of drug-induced changes in belief systems seems sufficiently intriguing and timely to deserve further investigation."
"2794","1","A feasibility study of low-dose ketamine for acute management of suicidal ideation.^
OBJECTIVE: Mood disorders complicated by suicidal ideation (SI) frequently present to the emergency department (ED) for care. Currently, patients with SI in the ED do not typically receive targeted interventions. Ketamine may have a role in treating SI within the ED because subanesthetic doses have rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. METHODS: This single-arm, open-label feasibility study enrolled 14 participants from the ED with acute SI who were awaiting voluntary admission to inpatient psychiatry to receive ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg, administered intravenously. Participants were assessed post administration to evaluate feasibility of administration in the ED and short-term effectiveness. Feasibility was determined by acceptability by patients and physicians as well as tolerability and ability to recruit participants into the study. Efficacy was assessed based on changes in (1) self-reported mood and (2) suicidal ideation pre- and postinfusion of ketamine. RESULTS: All patients reported severe depression and active SI at baseline. No serious adverse events were reported, and acceptability was rated highly by both participants and physicians (>70%). Two hours after receiving ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, the mean SI and somatic symptom burden were decreased compared to baseline (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively), and the mean self-reported mood was increased (P = 0.006). Improvements in mood and decreases in suicidality persisted at 6 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ketamine was well tolerated, considered feasible by both participants and physicians, and demonstrated short-term efficacy. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the feasibility of ketamine administration in the ED, and larger randomized trials should be conducted to establish treatment recommendations for patients with SI in the ED."

INTERVENTION: There will be two intervention arms and one control arm. Arm 1: 3 dose‐sessions of 25 mg oral psilocybin + psychotherapy Arm 2: 2 dose‐sessions of 25 mg oral psilocybin + psychotherapy Arm 3 (control): 3 dose‐sessions of oral inactive placebo + psychotherapy Each dose session will be 6‐8 hours in length, and will occur at the following time points: 1: 1 week post baseline; 2: 5 weeks post baseline; 3: 18 weeks post baseline. Administration of psilocybin and inactive placebo will be by oral tablet with neutral excipient, and will occur under direct supervision of a medical practitioner at the study site. All psychotherapy associated with the intervention will be administered face‐to‐face by a trained co‐therapist dyad consisting of one medically‐trained health professional (psychiatrist, psychiatry registrar, GP, or physician) and one psychologist. Psychotherapy will involve 2 Preparatory Sessions prior to Dose Session 1, at which time participants will be provided with information relating to psilocybin and its psychotropic effects. Supportive psychotherapy provided on‐site during Dose Sessions will consist of non‐directive psychological support within the context of a largely non‐interventional approach. Each Dose Session will be followed by 3 Integration Sessions, during which participants will be invited to discuss their experience during the Dose Session, and engage in analysis and meaning‐making to consolidate any therapeutic outcomes accrued during the experience.

Glutamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, and it is linked with the amino acid glutamine through a metabolic relationship of enzymatic compound interconversion and transportation, also known as the glutamate-glutamine cycle. A growing body of evidence suggests involvement of the glutamatergic neurotransmitter system in suicidal behaviours. The initial evidence comes from the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders, as disruptions in glutamate have been found underlying pathology in multiple suicide-related psychiatric conditions such as major depressive disorder, schizophrenia, post-traumatic stress disorder, and bipolar disorder. Existing data from experimental animal models and human in vivo studies also demonstrate that glutamate plays a key role in suicide-related personality traits including aggression and impulsive aggression. Further studies on glutamate system dysfunction underlying suicidal behaviours have focused on the different steps of the glutamate-glutamine cycle: an inflammation-mediated reduction of glutamine synthetase activity has been found in depressed suicide attempters, phosphate-activated glutaminase genes are reduced in suicide completers, and gene expression abnormalities in NMDA receptors have also been discovered in suicide victims. Evidence of a role of the glutamate-glutamine cycle in suicidal behaviours unveils new targets for anti-suicide interventions. Lithium's mechanism to reduce the risk of suicide in people with mood disorders may be related to its ability to increase glutamine synthetase, whereas novel NMDA antagonists such as ketamine [or its S(+) enantiomer esketamine] have already demonstrated positive results in reducing suicidal ideation."
"3412","0","Role of the mTOR signaling pathway in the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine.^
Some patients with major depressive disorder remain resistant to antidepressant medication. A randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind trial demonstrated that a single subanesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine caused a rapid antidepressant effect within hours in treatment-resistant patients with major depressive disorder. However, the precise cellular mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant actions were unclear, although it is proposed that the a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid receptor might be involved in these mechanisms. Recently, Li et al . reported the role of the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway, a ubiquitous protein kinase involved in protein synthesis and synaptic plasticity, in ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects. Here, these findings are put into context and their significance is discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"9256","1","Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy in adolescents with multiple psychiatric diagnoses.^
Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy is a promising new treatment for a variety of mental disorders of adolescence. There is currently an adolescent mental health crisis, with a high prevalence of disorders, diagnostic complexity, and many adolescents failing to respond to conventional treatments. While there is strong evidence for the use of ketamine in adults for a variety of treatment-refractory mental illnesses, research in adolescents is in its early stages. Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) has been described in adults with promising results and here we present the first published cases of the use of KAP in adolescents. The four cases include adolescents aged 14–19 at the initiation of treatment, each with a variety of comorbid diagnoses including treatment-resistant depression, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, anxiety, panic, and trauma-related symptoms. They each initially received sublingual ketamine, followed by sessions with intramuscular ketamine. Their courses varied, but each had symptomatic and functional improvements, and the treatment was well-tolerated. Subjective patient reports are included. Rapid resolution of symptomatology and suffering often occurs within months as the result of the application of KAP to adolescent psychiatric care but is not inevitable. Family involvement in the treatment process appears to be essential to success. The development of this modality may have a singularly positive impact that will expand the psychiatric toolbox and its healing potency."
"2777","0","Differences in response to implicit emotional faces in anterior cingulate cortex predict antidepressant response to scopolamine in major depressive disorder.^
Background: Activity in anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) predicts treatment response to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). The cholinergic neurotransmitter system provides input throughout cortex, including ACC, and is involved in processing emotional information. ACC and cholinergic dysfunction are characteristics of MDD, and the antimuscarinic scopolamine produces antidepressant effects. Here, we correlate antidepressant response to scopolamine with baseline differences in ACC response to emotional faces during implicit and explicit processing. Methods: Currently depressed MDD patients (n=10;males=1) participated in a fMRI attention study followed by a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled i.v. scopolamine (4ug/kg) trial. During the task, two images of superimposed faces (happy/sad) and houses were presented. Participants attended to faces (AF) or houses (AH) and performed a matching task; emotion was task‐irrelevant. Multiple regression estimated BOLD response during AF and AH when expressions were sad (AFs, AHs) and happy (AFh, AHh). The difference in BOLD signal during explicit (AFh‐AFs) and implicit (AHh‐AHs) processing in ACC was correlated with treatment response (percent change after scopolamine) using the MADRS (voxel p<0.001; SCV p<0.05). Results: During implicit processing, the difference in BOLD signal (AHh‐AHs) in ACC correlated with treatment outcome (r=+0.94, SVC). No significant correlation occurred for BOLD differences during explicit processing. Conclusions: Baseline differences in ACC activity during implicit processing of sad and happy faces predict treatment response to scopolamine. Larger responses to implicit happy than implicit sad faces predict larger treatment responses. Results indicate that baseline differences in the ACC response to emotional faces may provide a biomarker of treatment response."
"3609","1","Sequential regional cerebral blood flow brain scans using PET with H₂¹⁵O demonstrate ketamine actions in CNS dynamically.^
Presents the analysis of acute ketamine (KM) action on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes over time in a cohort of normal healthy Ss. 13 Ss received a 0.3 mg/kg intravenous dose of KM over 60 sec; 10 Ss received placebo in the same manner. For each S, 3 baseline PET rCBF scans and 7 sequential post-KM scans at 10-min intervals were obtained. Different analysis of the data show several distinctive aspects of the drug-induced rCBF changes over time. Elaborated by quantitative kinetic analysis, the dynamic sequential analysis of PET images and their cluster criteria provides an overall description of the location, extent and duration of a time-dependent KM drug effect. The lack of any significant clusters in the placebo condition or any cluster growth and regression over time suggests that the activation/reduction patterns depicted here are associated with KM drug action. The direct action of a centrally active drug can be assessed regionally and dynamically in brain using rCBF and a scan sequence optimally timed to complement the drug's time course. KM pharmacodynamics can be related to concurrent behavioral changes, tending to link the behavior with a brain region. This experimental design provides direct characterization of drug action in the CNS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

(1) Background: Condomless anal sex and substance use are associated with STI risk among gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (gbMSM). Our first study objective was to describe event-level sexual risk and substance use trends among gbMSM. Our second study objective was to describe substances associated with event-level sexual risk. (2) Methods: Data come from the Momentum Health Study in Vancouver, British Columbia and participants were recruited from 2012–2015, with follow-up until 2018. Stratified by self-reported HIV status, we used generalized estimating equations to assess trends of sexual event-level substance use and assessed interactions between substance use and time period on event-level higher risk sex defined as condomless anal sex with an HIV serodifferent or unknown status partner. (3) Results: Event-level higher risk anal sex increased across the study period among HIV-negative/unknown (baseline prevalence: 13% vs. study end prevalence: 29%) and HIV-positive gbMSM (baseline prevalence: 16% vs. study end prevalence: 38%). Among HIV-negative/unknown gbMSM, event-level erectile drug use increased, while alcohol use decreased over the study period. Overall, interactions between substance use and time on higher risk anal sex were not statistically significant, regardless of serostatus. However, we found a number of time-specific significant interactions for erectile drugs, poppers, Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy/MDMA use among HIV-negative/unknown gbMSM. (4) Conclusion: Significant differences in substance use trends and associated risks exist and are varied among gbMSM by serostatus. These findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of event-level substance use on sexual risk through longitudinal follow-up of nearly six years."
"2265","0","Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for depression: How dire is the need? How could we do it?.^
Despite the popular support for psychedelics as aids for depression, academics and the public frequently overestimate the efficacy of available medications and psychotherapies. Metaanalyses reveal that antidepressant medications alone help only one in four patients and rarely surpass credible placebos. Their effects, though statistically significant, might not impress depressed patients themselves. Psychotherapies create better outcomes than antidepressant drugs alone; combining the two provides measurable advantages. Nevertheless, the best combinations help only 65% of the clients who complete treatment. The drugs create side-effects and withdrawal surprisingly more severe than professional guidelines imply, too. Psychedelics appear to improve depression through some of the same mechanisms as psychotherapy, as well as some novel ones, suggesting that the combination could work very well. In addition, subjective experiences during the psychedelic sessions covary with improvement. Guiding clients to focus on these targeted thoughts and feelings could improve outcome. These data underscore the serious need for clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted, empirically supported treatment for depression with guided experiences during the psychedelic session. These trials would require important components to maximize their impact, including meaningful preparatory sessions designed to enhance motivation and explain empirically supported approaches, guided administration sessions that focus on oceanic boundlessness, integration sessions that support progress, and follow-up sessions consistent with established research. This combination involves markedly more than a simple pairing of medication and talk therapy, but proper application could have an unparalleled impact on public health.

"9141","0","Psychoactive substance use in patients diagnosed with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder: an exploratory study.^
INTRODUCTION: Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) was originally treated as a neurodevelopmental disorder that occurs mainly in children and tends to diminish or disappear with age, but we now know that symptoms persist into adulthood in over 50% of ADHD patients. Undiagnosed individuals often turn to psychoactive substance to minimize the negative aspects of functioning and improve quality of life. METHODS: The study was conducted online using random sampling through a Facebook group administered by physicians and targeted to patients diagnosed with ADHD. The study was naturalistic and exploratory, therefore no hypothesis was made. 438 correctly completed questionnaires were received. Analysis of the results showed that people with ADHD turn to psychoactive substances relatively frequently. RESULTS: The most commonly used stimulants include alcohol, marijuana, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), amphetamine/methamphetamine, and psilocybin. In the study population, methylphenidate is the most commonly used drug among patients. After treatment with psychostimulants, the majority of respondents note a decrease in symptoms of hyperactivity disorder, especially in male patients. CONCLUSION: It is necessary to perform proper diagnostics and actively look for ADHD symptoms in patients who tend to use psychoactive substances."
"2230","0","Glutamate concentration in the medial prefrontal cortex predicts resting-state cortical-subcortical functional connectivity in humans.^
Communication between cortical and subcortical regions is integral to a wide range of psychological processes and has been implicated in a number of psychiatric conditions. Studies in animals have provided insight into the biochemical and connectivity processes underlying such communication. However, to date no experiments that link these factors in humans in vivo have been carried out. To investigate the role of glutamate in individual differences in communication between the cortex--specifically the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC)--and subcortical regions in humans, a combination of resting-state fMRI, DTI and MRS was performed. The subcortical target regions were the nucleus accumbens (NAc), dorsomedial thalamus (DMT), and periaqueductal grey (PAG). It was found that functional connectivity between the mPFC and each of the NAc and DMT was positively correlated with mPFC glutamate concentrations, whilst functional connectivity between the mPFC and PAG was negatively correlated with glutamate concentration. The correlations involving mPFC glutamate and FC between the mPFC and each of the DMT and PAG were mirrored by correlations with structural connectivity, providing evidence that the glutamatergic relationship may, in part, be due to direct connectivity. These results are in agreement with existing results from animal studies and may have relevance for MDD and schizophrenia."
"6739","1","Comparing the analgesic effect of intranasal with intravenous ketamine in isolated orthopedic trauma: A randomized clinical trial.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine is commonly used in anesthetic and sedation before surgical procedures and acts as an analgesic in smaller doses. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intranasal (IN) ketamine in patients with moderate to severe limb trauma (visual analog scale (VAS) > 60 mm). METHODS: In a triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial; 154 patients with isolated orthopedic trauma and visual analog scale (VAS) ≥60 mm were included on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups of ketamine-IN (0.4 mg/kg IN ketamine and an equal volume of placebo saline intravenously (IV)) and ketamine-IV (0.2 mg/kg ketamine IV with 0.5 ml saline IN) on the basis of balanced block randomization method. At 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, patients were assessed for VAS measurement and adverse events. Repeated measure ANOVA, independent t-test and chi square test were employed. The level of statistical significance was considered to be less than 0.05. RESULTS: Mean VAS in IN ketamine and IV group at minute 30 was 31.50 ± 13.40 and 29.35 ± 11.73, respectively. At minute 30, 31 patients (20.39%) required a low-dose of morphine as rescue analgesia (P = 0.427). The results showed that mean change score of VAS (difference of time 0 and time 30) in IN ketamine and IV ketamine VAS were 43.8 (95% confidence interval: 41.1-46.5) and 46.4 (95% confidence interval: 42.8-50.1) and there is no difference between two groups in case of score change of VAS (P = 0.245). Adverse events in nasal and intravenous ketamine in both groups were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: IN ketamine is associated with few side effects and appropriate analgesic effects in isolated orthopedic trauma patients, and it may be used in cases where there is no need for venipuncture of peripheral vessels, especially in crowded EDs."

The current article presents a mixed qualitative-quantitative observational study of the effect of ayahuasca ritual on subjective experiences and personality traits on participants of a center specialized in the treatment of substance use disorder in Uruguay. When comparing the psychological traits of ayahuasca participants to a control group, quantitative results using the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire showed statistically significant higher scores in Impulsive Sensation Seeking, Boredom Susceptibility, and Social Warmth scales. Qualitative analysis of ayahuasca experiences resulted in five main categories: emotional experiences (including social emotions such as love and empathy), corporal experiences, spiritual/transcendental experiences, personal experiences, and visions. Last, qualitative descriptions provide support for the importance of social interactions in the phenomenological manifestations of the psychedelic experience. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the combination of social interactions and the pharmacological action of ayahuasca could facilitate the manifestation of social emotions during the ritual, and may contribute to the long-term increase of empathic and social aspects of personality."
"1108","1","Long-term effects of ""ecstasy"" use on serotonin transporters of the brain investigated by PET.^
Alterations of the serotonergic system due to ecstasy consumption have been extensively documented in recent literature. However, reversibility of these neurotoxic effects still remains unclear. To address this question, PET was performed using the serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand 11C-(+)- McN5652 in a total of 117 subjects subdivided into 4 groups: actual ecstasy users (n = 30), former ecstasy users (n = 29), drug-naive control subjects (n = 29), and subjects with abuse of psychoactive agents other than ecstasy (n = 29). Methods: About 500 MBq 11C-(+)-McN5652 were injected intravenously. Thirty-five scans were acquired according to a dynamic scan protocol of 90 min using a full-ring whole-body PET system. Transaxial slices were reconstructed using an iterative method. Individual brains were transformed to a template defined earlier. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were derived by application of a reference tissue approach for reversible binding. Gray matter of the cerebellum served as reference. SERT-rich brain regions - mesencephalon, putamen, caudate, and thalamus - were selected for the evaluation of SERT availability using volumes of interest predefined in the template. Results: Compared with drug-naive control subjects, the DVR in actual ecstasy users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon (P = 0.004) and the thalamus (P = 0.044). The DVR in former ecstasy users was very close to the DVR in drug-naive control subjects in all brain regions. The DVR in polydrug users was slightly higher than that in the drug-naive control subjects in all SERT-rich regions (not statistically significant). Conclusion: Our findings further support the hypothesis of ecstasy-induced protracted alterations of the SERT. In addition, they might indicate reversibility of the availability of SERT as measured by PET. However, this does not imply full reversibility of the neurotoxic effects."

This proposal aims to determine the most effective pharmacological regimen in the treatment of child pain and anxiety during outpatient dental procedures. Advancement in this field is a reflection, on the one hand, of the use of new and more effective routes of drug administration, such as the intranasal route using atomizers with uniform dispersion of the administered jet and, on the other hand, the use of new sedative drugs, such as dexmedetomidine. This is a randomized, parallel, triple‐masked clinical trial, using a research protocol with the objectives: 1) To evaluate the efficacy (behavior, pain, memory and stress) of a sedative regimen intranasally mucosal atomizer device (MAD) using a sedative drug (ketamine) and an innovative drug (dexmedetomidine) in the sedation of children from 2 to 6 years of age undergoing dental treatment ‐ our hypothesis is that the use of dexmedetomidine intranasally association with ketamine is more effective than dexmedetomidine itself in isolation; 2) To analyze the level of cortisol and salivary melatonin (stress) according to each sedative protocol and its association with clinical variables; 3) Identify adverse events with the new protocol; 4) To evaluate the association between the child's behavior and psychosocial variables; 5) To verify the impact of treatment under dental sedation on the quality of life related to the oral health of the child. The research will be carried out in the Faculty of Dentistry of the Federal University of Goias, in the Center of Studies in Dental Sedation (NESO), Goiânia, Goias.

Children with neuropathies, those using growth hormone and / or those who exhibit severe adverse events during sedation will be excluded. Children will be randomized to treatment according to a predetermined sequence of interventions consisting of: 1. intranasal sedation with ketamine‐associated dexmedetomidine (Experimental Group), 2. intranasal sedation with dexmedetomidine as sole drug (Control Group). Pediatricians and anesthesiologists will be aware of the randomized intervention, because of safety concerns for the child, in the case of serious adverse events with or without immediate use of antagonists; the other staff members and the child's companion (s) will be ""masked"". The examination and intervention sessions will be filmed in high definition for later analysis of the behavior and pain according to different scales consecrated and / or validated. In addition, the children will be submitted to four saliva collections to analyze the levels of cortisol and melatonin (stress‐related hormones). Other variables of secondary outcome are: perception of the accompanying adult, dentist and child about dental sedation and cost‐effectiveness of this type of sedation, psychosocial variables, quality of life. The data will be analyzed by descriptive and bivariate statistics. This proposal will bring benefits in the vast field of health sedation by having original design, using drugs and promising routes, with national and international impact. The project is inserted in a research line that presents experience history and impact publications by the proponent team, as well as involving students of scientific initiation, master's, doctorate, and postdoctoral studies, being developed by a multidisciplinary team. There is a clear expectation of generating results with high impact production, besides the possibility of immediate application in the public and private sectors of a highly effective sedative regime, minimizing the need to refer patients to general anesthesia."

Objective: To determine the objective neurocognitive effects of (1) single-dose ketamine, (2) repeated-dose ketamine, (3) ketamine adjunct to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and (4) ketamine as the anesthetic for ECT in major depressive disorder (MDD) and depression in bipolar disorder (BD). Data Sources: Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched on March 19, 2020 (updated July 2, 2020), using the terms terms major depressive disorder bipolar disorder and ketamine and their synonyms. Clinical trial registries (search date May 4, 2020) and reference sections of included articles were also searched. There was no restriction on language or year of publication. Study Selection: Of 4,035 identified articles, 17 met inclusion criteria. Controlled and open-label studies of adults who received at least 1 ketamine treatment for a current major depressive episode, as part of MDD or BD, were included. Only studies measuring cognition using at least 1 validated, objective neurocognitive assessment were eligible. Data Extraction: Results are presented using a narrative review format. Data regarding change in cognitive performance from baseline to end-of-treatment and/or differences in cognition between ketamine and control groups were extracted. Results: There were no negative effects of single- or repeated-dose intravenous ketamine up to 2 weeks post-treatment in MDD. Limited data were available for BD populations, as well as on other routes of ketamine administration. Conclusions: Data to definitively answer the question of whether ketamine has substantive or persistent cognitive effects are insufficient; thus, larger controlled trials measuring cognition as the primary outcome are needed. Future research should focus on different routes of ketamine administration, ketamine enantiomers, and BD populations."

Background: Ketamine is a high‐affinity non‐competitive NMDA (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic) receptor antagonist. In recent years, studies have found that ketamine has rapid onset antidepressant effect. However, the use of ketamine for antidepressant treatment has the risk of causing adverse reactions such as psychiatric symptoms, addiction, and so on. The aim of this study is to find DNA methylation sites related to the efficacy of ketamine and screening‐related genes. It will be the foundation of the accurate use of ketamine for depression. Methods: This study included a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of brain tumors with depression. The subjects received a small dose of ketamine intravenously (0.5mg/kg, 40 minutes) during the operation. The Montgomery‐ Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. According to the improvement of depression on the third day after operation, patients were divided into an effective group (MADRS score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 50%) and an ineffective group (MADRS score reduction rate is less than 50%). Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip (850K DNA methylation chip) was used to carry out genomewide methylation of peripheral blood in two groups. The methylation sites with significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05) were compared. According to the difference of methylation beta and the difference score, bioinformatics analysis was carried out using GO analysis and Pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to select chloramine. Ketone therapy is associated with different DNA methylation levels. Results: A total of 34 subjects using ketamine were included in this study, of who 20 were in the ineffective group and 14 were in the effective group. A total of 34,140 differentially methylated sites were identified by 850K DNA methylation chip screening. These differentially methylated sites were located on 13,209 genes. Through bioinformatics screening, we have identified 39 genes related to multiple pathways as the basis for subsequent research. Conclusion: It was found that many metabolic and signaling pathways were involved in the factors affecting the efficacy of ketamine. Through bioinformatics analysis and literature review, 39 anti‐ketamine drugs were screened out. Genes related to the efficacy of depression lay the foundation for future research."

The use of low doses of psychedelic substances (microdosing) is attracting increasing interest. This systematic review summarises all empirical microdosing research to date, including a set of infrequently cited studies that took place prior to prohibition. Specifically, we reviewed 44 studies published between 1955 and 2021, and summarised reported effects across six categories: mood and mental health; wellbeing and attitude; cognition and creativity; personality; changes in conscious state; and neurobiology and physiology. Studies showed a wide range in risk of bias, depending on design, age, and other study characteristics. Laboratory studies found changes in pain perception, time perception, conscious state, and neurophysiology. Self-report studies found changes in cognitive processing and mental health. We review data related to expectation and placebo effects, but argue that claims that microdosing effects are largely due to expectancy are premature and possibly wrong. In addition, we attempt to clarify definitional inconsistencies in the microdosing literature by providing suggested dose ranges across different substances. Finally, we provide specific design suggestions to facilitate more rigorous future research."
"6562","0","Ketamine Toxicity.^
Ketamine is a structural analog of the dissociative anesthetic and recreational drug phencyclidine (PCP). Similar to phencyclidine, ketamine causes analgesia and amnesia without the cardiovascular and respiratory depression associated with common anesthetics. Originally called CI-581, ketamine has one-tenth the potency of PCP and causes less severe dysphoria and hallucinations. After the chemist Calvin Stevens first synthesized ketamine in 1962, ketamine was tested in clinical trials performed in pediatric and adult surgical patients, and the Food and Drug Administration approved it for human use in 1970. Ketamine was the most common battlefield anesthetic used during the Vietnam War (fact file on ketamine). Intramuscular and intravenous forms of ketamine are commonly used to provide pediatric anesthesia, especially for high-risk children or patients in limited-resource settings. In surgical settings, ketamine is typically combined with benzodiazepines, which can reduce the adverse psychological symptoms that occur during emergence. Off-label, subanesthetic doses of ketamine also have a use for acute and chronic pain management, sedation, and treatment of severe depression. Like its chemical cousin phencyclidine, ketamine’s psychomimetic effects have made it a popular recreational drug. In low doses, it’s euphoric and dissociative effects are sometimes referred to as “k-land,” whereas at high doses, the immobilizing and hallucinogenic effects are referred to as being in a “k-hole.” In the context of an illegal, recreational drug, ketamine goes by the street names “K,” “vitamin K,” “super K,” “special K,” “super C,” “special LA coke,” “jet,” “superacid,” and “green.” Ketamine toxicity can cause a variety of neurological, cardiovascular, psychiatric, urogenital, and abdominal symptoms, which are dose-dependent, and depend on whether ketamine administration was in an iatrogenic or illicit context. For example, some experts have attributed the higher incidence of ulcerative cystitis in recreational users to the adulterants with which the drug is mixed. Emergency medicine providers should be aware of the various mechanisms to treat ketamine toxicity and to prevent acute complications such as rhabdomyolysis, seizures, and chronic complications such as psychiatric disturbances and ulcerative cystitis."
"1380","0","A Systematic Review of the MDMA Model to Address Social Impairment in Autism.^
BACKGROUND: Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterised by repetitive behaviours, cognitive rigidity/inflexibility, and social-affective impairment. Unfortunately, no gold-standard treatments exist to alleviate the core socio-behavioural impairments of ASD. Meanwhile, the prosocial empathogen/entactogen 3,4-methylene-dioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) is known to enhance sociability and empathy in both humans and animal models of psychological disorders. OBJECTIVE: We review the evidence obtained from behavioural tests across the current literature, showing how MDMA can induce prosocial effects in animals and humans, where controlled experiments were able to be performed. METHODS: Six electronic databases were consulted. The search strategy was tailored to each database. Only English-language papers were reviewed. Behaviours not screened in this review may have affected the core ASD behaviours studied. Molecular analogues of MDMA have not been investigated. RESULTS: We find that the social impairments may potentially be alleviated by postnatal administration of MDMA producing prosocial behaviours in mostly the animal model. CONCLUSION: MDMA and/or MDMA-like molecules appear to be an effective pharmacological treatment for the social impairments of autism, at least in animal models. Notably, clinical trials based on MDMA use are now in progress. Nevertheless, larger and more extended clinical studies are warranted to prove the assumption that MDMA and MDMA-like molecules have a role in the management of the social impairments of autism."

Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross‐over study 24 healthy participants received either 1) placebo1placebo, 2) placebo1LSD (100 mg po), or 3) ketanserin‐a selective 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist (40 mg po)1LSD (100 mg po) in three different sessions. Resting‐state FMRI scans were acquired 75 and 300 minutes after the second substance administration. We analyzed resting‐state functional connectivity with a data‐driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method to facilitate discovery. Results: LSD administration caused widespread alterations of GBC across cortical and subcortical regions. LSD decreased GBC in fronto‐medial and lateral areas, as well as basal ganglia, but increased GBC in the occipital, temporal, and parietal cortex. Similar patterns were found when comparing LSD with ketanserin1LSD. Negligible differences were observed when comparing ketanserin1LSD and placebo. Conclusions: Results revealed that LSD induces widespread GBC alterations that are predominantly attributable to its agonistic activity onto the 5‐HT2A receptor. While LSD reduces connectivity in attention networks, it increased connectivity across sensory areas. Present results inform psychedelics' mechanism of action pinpointing targets of therapeutic value and reinforce use of data‐driven neuroimaging methods for pharmacological imaging."

OBJECTIVES: To determine whether clinical and toxicologic findings differed between cases of amphetamine (AMP) and methamphetamine (mAMP) poisoning attended in 2 Balearic Island hospital emergency departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of AMP and mAMP cases with laboratory confirmation between 2013 and 2018. We compared clinical and toxicologic variables as well as clinical management between groups. RESULTS: 1) A total of 120 cases were found: 86 (71.7%) with AMP poisoning and 34 (28.3%) with mAMP poisoning. 2) Drug poisoning was confirmed by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 787 urine samples found to be positive during screening. One hundred fifty-four (19.6%) were confirmed by GC-MS. Thirtyfour of them did not meet the inclusion criteria. 3) Significant differences between AMP and mAMP cases were found for age (32.3 vs 28.4 y, respectively); sex (72.1% vs 94.1% men); and Spanish nationality (64.0% vs 29.4%). Reasons for admission and clinical features also differed: the reasons were aberrant behavior (15.1% in the AMP group vs 0% in the mAMP group) and palpitations (1.2% vs 20.6%); agitation was observed in 27.9% and 8.8%, respectively. Clinical management was similar in the 2 groups. Multiple drug poisoning was detected in 76.6% patients and was more common in patients in the AMP group (82.6% vs 61.8%). The additional drugs in these cases were mainly cocaine (63.0%), cannabis (48.9%), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) (38.0%), and alcohol (35.9%). Cannabis was detected in a significantly higher proportion in the AMP group (45.3%) than in the mAMP group (17.6%). False positives were found in 78.7% of the samples. The culprit drug was most often MDMA (71.2%). CONCLUSION: AMP poisonings were associated with age over 30 years, Spanish nationality, aberrant behavior, agitation, multiple drug findings, and the use of cannabis. Poisonings caused by mAMP abuse were associated with age under 30 years, non-Spanish nationality, palpitations, and single-drug use."
"6566","1","How does ayahuasca work from a psychiatric perspective? Pros and cons of the entheogenic therapy.^
OBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant preparation, traditionally consumed in sacred ceremonies by indigenous North-Westerner Amazonian countries like Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should be carried out in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, by implementing neuroimaging studies, in order to better evaluate therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in mental disorders."

Research among Asian users of methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA), also known as Ecstasy, is rare. To evaluate the feasibility of a study on the abuse of and dependence on Ecstasy, two focus groups of users (n=12) and health professionals (n=7) were conducted in Taiwan. Major results included blatant human testing with candy and dinosaur girls and a specific sequence of drugs called a Trinity (Ecstasy, ketamine, and marijuana). Head-shaked bars and KTVs were public places where illegal behaviors were implicitly allowed. Depression after Ecstasy use was not reported. For future studies, participants suggested that magnetic resonance imaging could be a strong incentive for young users to enhance willingness to participate.

"4238","1","Evaluation of cannabis, ecstasy and methamphetamine use in pharmacy students: Results of urinalysis.^
A survey on the use of illegal drugs was conducted in a group of university students in the Czech Republic. The evaluation of use of addictive substances was performed through toxicological urinalysis. Method: Urine specimens were anonymously collected from third year students of Charles University in Prague, Faculty of Pharmacy in Hradec Kralove. Cannabinoids (THC), methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and methamphetamine (MET) were searched for by simple, one-step, immunochromatographic assay for the rapid, qualitative detection. Preliminary positive analytical results were then confirmed by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Results: 150 urine specimens were collected, 67 students refused to participate in the study. The average age of students was 21.7 years (range: 20-29). The number of females was higher (74.7 %) than that of males (25.3 %). The presence of THC was detected in 6 samples, no evidence of MDMA and MET was found. When comparing males and females, a significant difference was estimated in the use of THC (chi-square test, p = 0.0009). Conclusion: According to results of urinalysis the pattern of cannabis use in the group of pharmacy students seems to be irregular."
"1806","1","A Single Ketamine Infusion Combined With Motivational Enhancement Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder: A Randomized Midazolam-Controlled Pilot Trial.^
OBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy and behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder are limited in their effectiveness, and new treatments with innovative mechanisms would be valuable. In this pilot study, the authors tested whether a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine administered to adults with alcohol dependence and engaged in motivational enhancement therapy affects drinking outcomes. METHODS: Participants were randomly assigned to a 52-minute intravenous administration of ketamine (0.71 mg/kg, N=17) or the active control midazolam (0.025 mg/kg, N=23), provided during the second week of a 5-week outpatient regimen of motivational enhancement therapy. Alcohol use following the infusion was assessed with timeline followback method, with abstinence confirmed by urine ethyl glucuronide testing. A longitudinal logistic mixed-effects model was used to model daily abstinence from alcohol over the 21 days after ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Participants (N=40) were mostly middle-aged (mean age=53 years [SD=9.8]), predominantly white (70.3%), and largely employed (71.8%) and consumed an average of five drinks per day prior to entering the study. Ketamine significantly increased the likelihood of abstinence, delayed the time to relapse, and reduced the likelihood of heavy drinking days compared with midazolam. Infusions were well tolerated, with no participants removed from the study as a result of adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: A single ketamine infusion was found to improve measures of drinking in persons with alcohol dependence engaged in motivational enhancement therapy. These preliminary data suggest new directions in integrated pharmacotherapy-behavioral treatments for alcohol use disorder. Further research is needed to replicate these promising results in a larger sample."

OBJECTIVE: Research into psychedelic therapy models has shown promise for the treatment of specific psychiatric conditions. Mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin have been correlated with therapeutic benefits and long-term improvements in positive mental outlook and attitudes. This article aims to provide an overview of the topic, highlight strengths and weaknesses in current research, generate novel perspectives and discussion, and consider future avenues for research. DESIGN: This narrative review was designed to summarise and assess the state of research on psilocybin occasioned mystical-type experiences and applications for the treatment of specific psychiatric conditions. RESULTS: Contemporary methods on the quantification of mystical-type experiences and their acute subjective effects are discussed. Recent studies provide some understanding of the pharmacological actions of psychedelics although the neurological similarities and differences between spontaneous and psychedelic mystical-type experiences are not well described. Applicability to modern clinical settings is assessed. Potential novel therapeutic applications include use in positive psychology interventions in healthy individuals. CONCLUSIONS: Since 2006 significant advancements in understanding the therapeutic potential of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy have been made; however, more work is required to understand the neuromechanistic processes and applicability in modern clinical settings. Despite promising results in recent studies, funding issues for clinical trials, legal concerns and socio-cultural resistance provide a counterpoint to experimental evidence."
"5680","1","Intravenous ketamine relieves pain and depression after traumatic suicide attempts: A case series.^
The letter presents a series of cases where, after traumatic suicide attempts, authors administered intravenous doses of ketamine to decrease pain and acute suicidal thoughts. The first case is an 81-year-old man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted neck laceration and left wrist laceration. On initial psychiatric consultation, it was discovered that the patient had been holding a delusional belief that he and his wife were developing dementia. After discussion with the patient, family, and surgical specialists, it was decided that the patient was not medically stable for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) and pharmacotherapy was initiated to target symptoms of depression and psychosis using venlafaxine, mirtazapine, and aripiprazole on hospital day 3. The second case is also an elderly man who presented with a suicide attempt involving self-inflicted bilateral orbit trauma. The treatment team decided to start him on venlafaxine and mirtazapine with a rapid titration to doses of 225 mg and 30 mg, respectively. In this set of 2 cases, we have provided strong evidence of the utility of intravenous ketamine for treatment of comorbid pain, depression, and suicidal ideation after traumatic suicide attempts. This combines the traditional use of ketamine as an anesthetic with newly discovered antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. In these 2 cases, symptom relief was the desired outcome of treatment, and by this metric, the use of ketamine was a success in these patients in terms of management of pain, depression, and suicidality. Of note, both patients in this series were elderly and diagnosed as having MDD with psychotic features. These patients did not have any exacerbation of psychosis and rather appeared to lessen these symptoms, possibly by exerting treatment of their underlying depression. These treatments were given in the clinical setting, and outcomes were measured by clinicians and thus not subject to rigorous scientific scrutiny one would see in the setting of a clinical trial. This case series bolsters the ongoing discussion of how to best use intravenous administration of ketamine to treat psychiatric disorders, particularly when comorbid pain is present and/or ECT is unavailable.

AIMS: To better understand the prevalence, correlates, risk factors and context of club drug use among US adults in the City of Chicago. DESIGN: An Audio Computer-Assisted Self Interview was administered to a household probability sample of adults, aged 18-40 years, from June 2001 to January 2002. SETTING: Subjects were drawn from randomly selected households using a multi-stage area probability design. PARTICIPANTS: The data represent 627 randomly selected adult participants. MEASUREMENT: Weighted prevalence estimates with design-effect adjusted confidence intervals of life-time, past 12 month and past 30 day use of any club drug and of specific club drugs; prevalence of rave attendance, other drug use, motivation for use among club drug users; chi2 tests of significance, logistic regression and adjusted odds ratios. FINDINGS: Overall club drug prevalence rates were nearly twice those obtained for MDMA alone. Club drug users were more likely to use multiple illicit substances and to report having been in treatment for substance use. A majority of life-time club drug users never attended a rave although rave attendees were more likely to report frequent use of MDMA. Use was associated with gender, race and sexual orientation. CONCLUSIONS: Prevention research should be informed by further population-based research on club drug use. Research should not focus exclusively on rave attendees, as they are only a subset of club drug users. Research is needed on neurological and behavioral sequelae across different types of club drugs, gender differences in the impact of sexual orientation on club drug risk and on the effects of personality characteristics such as sensation seeking on club drug use behavior."
"4927","0","Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis of presentations to an urban emergency department in Switzerland.^
Background Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy). Aims of the study To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence. Methods Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded. Results The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic. Conclusion Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances."

BACKGROUND: Ketamine has proven to have rapid, robust antidepressant effects on treatment-resistant depression. However, whether repeated ketamine infusions would cause short-and long-term neurocognitive impairments was not clear. Our aims were to investigate the neurocognitive effects of six ketamine infusions and to examine the association between these infusions and the antidepressant response in patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. METHODS: Six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) over a 12-day period were administered to 84 patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Severity of depressive symptoms and four domains of neurocognition, including speed of processing, working memory, visual learning and verbal learning, were assessed at baseline, one day following the last infusion and again two weeks post-infusion. RESULTS: Significant improvements were found on speed of processing ( F=9.344, p<0.001) and verbal learning ( F=5.647, p=0.004) in a linear mixed model. The Sobel test showed significant indirect effects between time and improvement in speed of processing (Sobel test=3.573, p<0.001) as well as improvement in verbal learning (Sobel test=6.649, p<0.001), which were both significantly mediated by change in depressive symptoms. Logistic regression analysis showed ketamine responders had better visual learning at baseline than non-responders (B=0.118, p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggest that neurocognitive function would not deteriorate after six ketamine infusions, while verbal learning and speed of processing improved over 13 days and 26 days of observation, respectively. However, this change was mainly accounted for by improvements in severity of depressive symptoms over time. Greater baseline visual learning predicted an antidepressant response over six ketamine infusions."
"1509","1","Effects of Psychedelic Use on Racial Trauma Symptoms and Ethnic Identity among Asians in North America.^
There is a need to understand ways in which Asians in North America attempt to heal from racial trauma, given their well-documented high risk of exposure and associated adverse mental health outcomes. We conducted a secondary analysis of Asians from a survey of people of color in North America who have consumed psychedelics in response to racial discrimination. Ninety-two Asian participants (M age = 30.25, SD = 6.83) completed online questions assessing demographics, racial discrimination frequency, characteristics and acute effects of their most meaningful psychedelic experience, change in racial trauma symptoms 30 days before and after their psychedelic experience, and current ethnic identity. Participants reported improvements in racial trauma symptoms (d = 0.52). Bootstrapped mediation analyses controlling for racial discrimination frequency and psychedelic dose and duration indicated complete mediation of the link between higher intensity of insightful experiences and stronger ethnic identity, via improvements in racial trauma symptoms (indirect effect =.08, 95% CI = [.004,.19]). There was partial mediation for the independent variable of lower intensity of challenging experiences (indirect effect = −.08, 95% CI = [−.18, −.005]). This study highlights the central role of higher-intensity insightful experiences and both higher- and lower-intensity challenging experiences in alleviating racial trauma symptoms and promoting ethnic identity among Asians in North America who have experienced racial discrimination. Future research should attune to culturally relevant outcomes of psychedelic use in response to racial discrimination among Asians."
"5048","1","Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine: Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p < 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD. LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: After six ketamine infusions, neurocognitive improvement was observed in patients with anxious TRD but not in patients with nonanxious TRD."
"4142","1","LSD modulates music-induced imagery via changes in parahippocampal connectivity.^
Psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were used extensively in psychiatry in the past and their therapeutic potential is beginning to be re-examined today. Psychedelic psychotherapy typically involves a patient lying with their eyes-closed during peak drug effects, while listening to music and being supervised by trained psychotherapists. In this context, music is considered to be a key element in the therapeutic model; working in synergy with the drug to evoke therapeutically meaningful thoughts, emotions and imagery. The underlying mechanisms involved in this process have, however, never been formally investigated. Here we studied the interaction between LSD and music-listening on eyes-closed imagery by means of a placebo-controlled, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75µg) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which LSD works in combination with music listening to enhance certain subjective experiences that may be useful in a therapeutic context."
"7068","0","A statewide evaluation system for early psychosis.^
Objective: We describe a system of outcome evaluation for early psychosis programmes and present preliminary data. The Early Psychosis Outcome Evaluation System (EPOES) was designed for use in a naturalistic, prospective study of a cohort of early-episode psychosis patients. We describe patients in terms of symptoms, substance use, social functioning and family burden, and examine the effectiveness of treatment programmes. Method: Four sites in Perth, Western Australia, participated. Outcome was evaluated from three sources: case manager (CM), patient (P) and family member (FM). Seven clinical outcome measures were used: the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (CM), Brief Symptom Inventory (P), Substance Use (CM); Social Functioning Scale (P); Global Assessment Scale (CM); Burden Assessment Scale (FM), and the General Health Questionnaire-12 (FM). Measures were collected at intake (baseline) into a specialist early psychosis service and thereafter every 6 months until discharge from the service. Results: After the first year of data capture, 84 baseline assessments have been completed, and 23 patients have been followed up at 6 months. Clinicians and patients reported significantly less psychopathology at 6 months. Sixty per cent of patients reported marijuana use within 3 months of baseline assessment, and 30% amphetamine, ecstasy or cocaine use. Increased levels of psychopathology were recorded for substance-using patients. Family members (59%) reported psychological distress at baseline; this was reduced at 6 months. Patient social functioning and family burden did not improve measurably. Conclusions: The EPOES is an effective system that provides feedback on the clinical status of early-episode psychosis patients. Both observed and self-rated psychopathology and family psychological distress, is improved after 6 months of intervention. Family burden and patient social functioning did not demonstrate improvement. Patient social functioning is an important area for treatment. Substance use is associated with poorer psychopathology. EPOES provides a feasible system of measuring outcome in early psychosis intervention."

Studies of Part I showed that some questions were not so significant for the LSD reaction as were others. Part II can be used as a short mental rating test. According to the particular experimental design, Ss filled in Parts I and II and were also questioned by the Os with additional notes on the back of the chart by the Ss. Nonpsychotic Ss know the contents of the questionnaire before the experiment. Placebo reactors are high; therefore it is imperative to have essentially placebo-negative Ss.

Forty naive male albino rats were trained to press a bar on a fixed ratio (FR 32) schedule of water reinforcement. They were then divided into two groups, one of which (N=20) received 5 min of extra water 12 hr before each experimental session; the other group (N=20) received no extra water. Half of the animals in each group was then given three daily doses (100 mg/kg) of the tryptophan hydroxylase inhibitor p chlorophenylalanine methyl ester (PCPA) while the remaining animals were given control injections of the PCPA vehicle. Ten days following the last administration of PCPA (or vehicle) all animals were given a low dose of LSD (20 μg/kg). Bar pressing behavior was significantly disrupted only in those animals receiving both PCPA and extra water. Central (whole brain) concentrations of serotonin (5 HT) were significantly lower in all animals which had been treated with PCPA. These results, along with those previously reported, suggest that amount of deprivation can be an important determinant of both the ability of drugs to alter behavior and the dependence of such alterations upon underlying neuronal activity."
"6854","1","Use of salvia divinorum in a nationally representative sample.^
Background: Salvia divinorum has known hallucinogenic effects and is legal in most parts of the United States. Given that this psychoactive substance has a potential of misuse and abuse, further data regarding the clinical and psychosocial factors associated with use are needed. Objectives: To examine the clinical and psychosocial characteristics associated with use of salvia. Methods: The study uses data from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health, 2008 (N = 55,623). Results: The results of this study suggest that salvia use is most common among young adults aged 1825 years as well as individuals who had engaged in risk-taking behaviors (selling illicit drugs, stealing) or illicit drug use (especially other hallucinogens/ecstasy). Self-reported depression and anxiety were also associated with salvia use. Conclusions/Scientific Significance: The results provide evidence that salvia use is part of a broader constellation of psychosocial and behavioral problems among youth and young adults. The accessibility, legal status, and psychoactive effects of salvia can be a potentially complicating health risk to young people, especially among those with existing substance use problems. © 2012 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."

In a multicenter efficacy study 82 psychiatric and psychosomatic patients answered questions about the mechanism of action of dance movement therapy (DMT). It was hypothesized that there is (1) a positive effect of DMT on stress (measured with the visual analog scale, VAS), self-efficacy expectations (measured with the general self- efficacy short scale, ASKU; Beierlein et al. 2012) and well-being (measured with the Heidelberg state inventory, HSI; Koch et al. 2016) and (2) changes in the three outcomes for the treatment time could be predicted by general psychotherapy, creative arts therapies, and specific factors of DMT. The self-constructed questionnaire DMT-SF scale to assess specific factors of DMT was psychometrically explored. The results showed a significant improvement in all outcomes with large effect sizes (p < 0.0001; ηp² = 0.49). The changes in stress and well-being could be statistically significantly predicted by the general psychotherapeutic efficacy factors. For the DMT-SF scale the study found satisfactory criteria as well as a three-factorial solution with the dimensions of embodiment, concreteness, and being mirrored (with the variance resolution of 61.28%). The additional qualitative analysis of the textual statements of the patients about the mechanism of action of DMT bundled a variety of therapeutic factors into six global themes in a thematic network. The DMT was named by half of the patients as the most helpful therapy in the treatment spectrum. It became clear that DMT makes a significant contribution as an integrative medical procedure in the clinical context. Furthermore, the results of the DMT-SF scale suggested that embodiment (here with an emphasis on interoception, i.e., the ability to perceive one’s own bodily signals) as an important general factor of DMT with respect to psychotherapy in general, should be given more weight and further investigated in future studies.

"7198","0","Has psychiatry tamed the ""ketamine tiger?"" Considerations on its use for depression and anxiety.^
Ketamine has been available for approximately 50 years as an anesthetic agent. It is known to have potent effects on the central nervous system glutamatergic system, in particular blockade of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Based upon pre-clinical evidence of involvement of the glutamatergic system in mood disorders, studies have been undertaken to test the antidepressant properties of ketamine. Several well-controlled studies, along with open-label case series, have established that ketamine can have rapid antidepressant effects. Additionally, data exist showing benefits of ketamine in post-traumatic stress disorder as well as obsessive compulsive disorder. However, improvements in these conditions tend to be short-lived with single infusions of ketamine. Of concern, ketamine has been associated with neurotoxicity in pre-clinical rodent models and is well-known to cause psychotomimetic effects and addiction in humans. While ketamine has been proven safe for use in sub-anesthetic doses administered once or a few times, the safety profile of prolonged use has not been established. Aspects of safety, possible mechanisms of action, and future directions of ketamine research are discussed in addition to the clinical literature on its use in psychiatric conditions."
"2724","1","Superstitious conditioning as a model of delusion formation following chronic but not acute ketamine in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has previously been shown to induce delusion-like or referential beliefs, both acutely in healthy volunteers and naturalistically among nonintoxicated users of the drug. Delusions are theoretically underpinned by increased superstitious conditioning or the erroneous reinforcement of random events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a novel and objectively measured superstitious conditioning task, experiment 1 assessed healthy volunteers before and during placebo (n = 16), low-dose (n = 15), and high-dose ketamine (n = 16) under randomized and double-blind conditions. Experiment 2 used the same task to compare ketamine users (n = 18), polydrug controls (n = 19), and nondrug-using controls (n = 17). RESULTS: In experiment 1, ketamine produced dose-dependent psychotomimetic effects but did not cause changes in superstitious conditioning. Experiment 2 found increased levels of superstitious conditioning among ketamine users compared to polydrug and nondrug-using controls, respectively, as evidenced by both objective task responses and subjective beliefs following the task. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that chronic but not acute exposure to ketamine may increase the propensity to adopt superstitious conditioning. These findings are discussed in terms of acute and chronic ketamine models of delusion-like belief formation in schizophrenia."

Analyses of the EEG amplitude levels (integrative method) in the right (R) and left (L) occipital areas of human subjects reveal that there exists in most subjects a R/L difference, and that certain psychoactive drugs can change the relationships which prevail under normal conditions (lateralization). Stimulants tend to decrease interhemispheric differences while, on the contrary, following drug induced euphoria, these differences are increased. Hallucinogens can reverse lateralization; neuroleptics produce a decrease in the variability of amplitude ratios. Sedatives, minor tranquillizers and placebo are without effect.

Animal models of depression repeatedly showed stress-induced nucleus accumbens (NAc) hypertrophy. Recently, ketamine was found to normalize this stress-induced NAc structural growth. Here, we investigated NAc structural abnormalities in major depressive disorder (MDD) in two cohorts. Cohort A included a cross-sectional sample of 34 MDD and 26 healthy control (HC) subjects, with high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to estimate NAc volumes. Proton MR spectroscopy ((1)H MRS) was used to divide MDD subjects into two subgroups: glutamate-based depression (GBD) and non-GBD. A separate longitudinal sample (cohort B) included 16 MDD patients who underwent MRI at baseline then 24 h following intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). In cohort A, we found larger left NAc volume in MDD compared to controls (Cohen's d=1.05), but no significant enlargement in the right NAc (d=0.44). Follow-up analyses revealed significant subgrouping effects on the left (d⩾1.48) and right NAc (d⩾0.95) with larger bilateral NAc in non-GBD compared to GBD and HC. NAc volumes were not different between GBD and HC. In cohort B, ketamine treatment reduced left NAc, but increased left hippocampal, volumes in patients achieving remission. The cross-sectional data provided the first evidence of enlarged NAc in patients with MDD. These NAc abnormalities were limited to patients with non-GBD. The pilot longitudinal data revealed a pattern of normalization of left NAc and hippocampal volumes particularly in patients who achieved remission following ketamine treatment, an intriguing preliminary finding that awaits replication."

"9258","0","The psychedelic effects of cannabis: A review of the literature.^
Cannabis and classic psychedelics are controlled substances with emerging evidence of efficacy in the treatment of a variety of psychiatric illnesses. Cannabis has largely not been regarded as having psychedelic effects in contemporary literature, despite many examples of historical use along with classic psychedelics to attain altered states of consciousness. Research into the ""psychedelic"" effects of cannabis, and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) in particular, could prove helpful for assessing potential therapeutic indications and elucidating the mechanism of action of both cannabis and classic psychedelics. This review aggregates and evaluates the literature assessing the capacity of cannabis to yield the perceptual changes, aversiveness, and mystical experiences more typically associated with classic psychedelics such as psilocybin. This review also provides a brief contrast of neuroimaging findings associated with the acute effects of cannabis and psychedelics. The available evidence suggests that high-THC cannabis may be able to elicit psychedelic effects, but that these effects may not have been observed in recent controlled research studies due to the doses, set, and settings commonly used. Research is needed to investigate the effects of high doses of THC in the context utilized in therapeutic studies of psychedelics aimed to occasion psychedelic and/or therapeutic experiences. If cannabis can reliably generate psychedelic experiences under these conditions, high-THC dose cannabis treatments should be explored as potential adjunctive treatments for psychiatric disorders and be considered as an active comparator in clinical trials involving traditional psychedelic medications."
"1352","1","What is the clinical evidence on psilocybin for the treatment of psychiatric disorders? A systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a predominant agonist of 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A/C) receptors and was first isolated in 1958, shortly before it became a controlled substance. Research on the potential therapeutic effects of this compound has recently re-emerged alongside what is being addressed as a psychedelic renaissance. METHODS: In this paper we performed a systematic review of the clinical trials conducted so far regarding the therapeutic effects of psilocybin on psychiatric disorders. The eligibility criteria included clinical trials that assessed psilocybin's potential therapeutic effects on patients with psychiatric disorders. Nine hundred seven articles were found and screened in regard to the title, from which 94 were screened through abstract and 9 met the eligibility criteria and were included. RESULTS: The papers published focused on 3 disorders: depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorder (namely tobacco and alcohol). Psilocybin has shown a relatively safe profile and very promising results, with reductions found on most of the psychiatric rating scales' scores. Research on depression showed the most solid evidence, supported by 3 randomized controlled trials. Studies on OCD and substance use disorder showed more limitations due to their open-label design. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the results from the studies reviewed in this paper suggest a substantial therapeutic potential. This calls for further research to confirm the results observed so far and further explain the underlying mechanisms."

Comments on an article by M. Ranganathan et al. (see record [rid]2012-19607-001[/rid]). In their study, Ranganathan et al. explored the psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, neuroendocrine effects, and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) effects resulting from the controlled administration of Salvinorin A (SA) to humans. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the effects of SA in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, counterbalanced study in healthy humans. To perform this study, Ranganathan et al. recruited 10 psychiatrically and medically healthy subjects who had previous experience with SA and, in some cases, other psychoactive medications. Consistent with anecdotal reports, the subjects experienced a rapid, short-lasting, and intense psychoactive effect of SA. To gain a better understanding of the endocrine effects of SA, the authors measured the cortisol and prolactin serum levels after SA administration. Resting EEG power is sensitive to drug-induced changes in consciousness and may be altered in psychosis. The authors reported that both doses of SA decreased resting-state EEG spectral power compared with the placebo. The authors did not comment on any sex differences in SA effects. The authors noted that the effects of SA make it unlikely to cause addiction, which is likely a result of KOR agonists’ aversive effects. Most importantly, this study extends our knowledge of drug-induced psychotomimesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"9195","1","Attenuation of Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine by Opioid Receptor Antagonism.^
OBJECTIVE: In addition to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism, ketamine produces opioid system activation. The objective of this study was to determine whether opioid receptor antagonism prior to administration of intravenous ketamine attenuates its acute antidepressant or dissociative effects. METHOD: In a proposed double-blind crossover study of 30 adults with treatment-resistant depression, the authors performed a planned interim analysis after studying 14 participants, 12 of whom completed both conditions in randomized order: placebo or 50 mg of naltrexone preceding intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Response was defined as a reduction ≥50% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score on postinfusion day 1. RESULTS: In the interim analysis, seven of 12 adults with treatment-resistant depression met the response criterion during the ketamine plus placebo condition. Reductions in 6-item and 17-item HAM-D scores among participants in the ketamine plus naltrexone condition were significantly lower than those of participants in the ketamine plus placebo condition on postinfusion days 1 and 3. Secondary analysis of all participants who completed the placebo and naltrexone conditions, regardless of the robustness of response to ketamine, showed similar results. There were no differences in ketamine-induced dissociation between conditions. Because naltrexone dramatically blocked the antidepressant but not the dissociative effects of ketamine, the trial was halted at the interim analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ketamine's acute antidepressant effect requires opioid system activation. The dissociative effects of ketamine are not mediated by the opioid system, and they do not appear sufficient without the opioid effect to produce the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression."

Oral surgery patients premedicated with intoxicating doses of an intravenous marijuana compound, Deltasup 9tetrahydrocannabinol (Deltasup 9THC), showed pronounced elevations of anxiety states in comparison to control, placebo, or diazepam responses (P<0.01). Autonomic functions and tendencies for syncopal hypotension were also increased beyond those in controls. Deltasup 9THC exerted no measurable effects on pain tolerance thresholds. However, noxious stimuli were perceived by patients as significantly more 'painful'. The predominant mood experience was dysphoria with psychotic like swings from dysphoria to euphoria, transient panic and paranoia, depersonalization, time disintegration, and perceptual illusions. All of these appeared to be intensified by the stress of surgery. Despite the adverse emotional experience, the patients' overt behavior did not translate the intensity of the experience to the surgeon. Surgeons should be warned that marijuana combined with mild surgical stress, even among healthy well adjusted men, may lead to psychophysiologic complications. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B.

MDMA is a monoamine releaser and uptake inhibitor affecting serotonin, potentially increasing the risk of serotonin syndrome (SS). No instances of SS have occurred in clinical trials. The relatively small number of patients in controlled trials warranted a survey of FDA Adverse Event Reporting System data for the occurrence of SS in a larger database. We found 20 SS cases in people exposed to MDMA, all of which had also taken one or more substances with serotonergic properties in addition to MDMA, including amphetamines, stimulants, and opioids. There were no cases of SS associated with MDMA where MDMA was the sole reported compound taken."

A pilot open study was conducted in order to evaluate the efficacy of clonidine in the treatment of LSD-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD). Eight patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received fixed low doses of clonidine, 0.025 mg, three times a day for 2 months. They were evaluated by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and a self-report scale on the severity of symptoms (graded 0-5). Patients scored an average of 5.25 (SD = 0.46) on the CGI and 4 on the self-report scale at baseline, indicating marked psychopathology. One patient dropped out at week 3 and a second patient dropped out at week 5. Of the six patients remaining at the end of 2 months, the average CGI score was 2.5 (SD = 0.55) and the self-report scale score was 2, indicating mild symptomatology. LSD-related flashbacks associated with excessive sympathetic nervous activity may be alleviated with clonidine in some patients."
"5998","1","Comparison of the effect of ketamine and sodium thiopental on blood pressure and heart rate during electroconvulsive therapy in patients admitted to the ward of psychiatry; a double-blind randomized clinical trial.^
Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one the most effective therapies for the treatment of patients with psychotic disorders. Ketamine increases the seizure duration after electroconvulsive therapy. However, the routine use of ketamine may be limited due to concerns about the side effects. The aim of this study was to compare the effect of ketamine and sodium thiopental on blood pressure and heart rate during and after electroconvulsive therapy. Methods: The study included 64 patients who were candidates for receiving electroconvulsive therapy seizures. Consequently, patients were divided into two groups of 32 patients. Each patient received drug randomly. The collected data were analyzed using independent t and chi-square tests. Findings: Mean arterial pressure (MAP) at the fifth (P = 0.001) and tenth (P = 0.003) minutes after the seizures was higher in ketamine group. Mean heart rate at the first (P = 0.020), fifth (P = 0.001) and tenth (P = 0.002) minutes after the seizures was significantly greater in ketamine group, too. In addition, the duration of seizures in ketamine group was significantly higher than the sodium thiopental group (P = 0.001). Conclusion: Although, anesthesia induced by ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy increased blood pressure, heart rate and seizure duration, but due to lower medical complication, ketamine is an appropriate option for anesthesia in electroconvulsive therapy."
"224","1","Efficacy of esketamine in the treatment of depression with psychotic features: A case series.^
This small case series provides evidence of the safety and efficacy of esketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with psychotic features. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment of TRD with psychotic symptoms with esketamine administered subcutaneously. Ketamine has been used to induce a pharmacological model of psychosis, because it produces a syndrome consisting of disordered thought, perceptual abnormalities, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and memory impairments in healthy subjects. Because of that, nearly all clinical and research protocols have used the presence of psychotic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for treatment with ketamine. However, different sources of evidence have suggested that psychotic manifestations associated with ketamine are transient and clinically non significant. Although ketamine has significant perceptual effects, they are transient and usually occur at higher doses than those necessary for depression treatment. In addition, the findings of the present study are in line with previous studies reporting remission of both depressive and psychotic symptoms after treatment of patients with depression and acute psychosis or a history of psychosis. Moreover, studies examining patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern of psychotomimetic manifestations following low-dose ketamine administration. Notably, they experienced mild, short-lasting increases in psychotic symptoms, but these had no impact on the longterm outcome of these patients with psychosis. As previously suggested, inclusion of patients with psychotic depression in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine should be encouraged.

"3156","0","Electroconvulsive therapy-induced persistent retrograde amnesia: could it be minimised by ketamine or other pharmacological approaches?.^
BACKGROUND: Certain pharmacological agents administered during electroconvulsive therapy may have the potential to prevent persistent retrograde amnesia induced during electroconvulsive therapy. This review examines mechanisms for electroconvulsive therapy-induced retrograde amnesia, and evaluates the suitability of the anaesthetic ketamine for preventing this amnestic outcome. METHODS: A review of human studies, animal models and theoretical models in light of memory dysfunction following electroconvulsive therapy was conducted. MEDLINE was searched from 1950 to April 2009 using the MeSH terms ""electroconvulsive therapy"", ""memory"", ""memory short term"", ""memory disorders"", ""excitatory amino acid antagonists"", and ""ketamine"". PREMEDLINE was searched using the terms ""electroconvulsive therapy"", ""amnesia"" and ""ketamine"". Additional keyword and reference list searches were performed. No language, date constraints or article type constraints were used. RESULTS: Disruption of long term potentiation as a mechanism for electroconvulsive therapy-induced retrograde amnesia is well supported. Based on this putative mechanism, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist would appear suitable for preventing the retrograde amnesia. Available evidence in animals and humans supports the prediction that ketamine, an anaesthetic agent and N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, could effectively prevent electroconvulsive therapy-induced persistent retrograde amnesia. Whilst there are concerns about the use of ketamine with electroconvulsive therapy, such as possible psychotomimetic effects, on balance this anaesthetic agent may improve or hasten clinical response to electroconvulsive therapy. CONCLUSIONS: A clinical trial is warranted to determine if ketamine anaesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy can lessen persistent retrograde amnesia and improve therapeutic response. Electroconvulsive therapy with ketamine anaesthesia may provide effective antidepressant action with minimal side effects."
"4730","1","Intranasal ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^
Background: Current treatments for depression are only partially effective and exhibit delays in onset of therapeutic efficacy. Several studies have reported a rapid onset of antidepressant action for intravenous (IV) ketamine‐and NMDA receptor antagonist‐in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Despite potential efficacy, the requirement for IV administration imposes potential limitations to therapeutic delivery. In contrast, ketamine delivery via an intranasal (IN) route may provide a more feasible treatment approach. Herein we report the first placebo‐controlled study of IN ketamine in TRD. Methods: Twenty subjects with TRD in a current major depressive episode were randomized to receive IN ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg) or 0.9% saline solution, in a crossover design with one of two treatment orders: either ketamineplacebo (KET‐PBO) or placebo‐ketamine (PBO‐KET); KET or PBO were administered 1‐2 weeks apart. 18 subjects received both treatments under randomized, double blind conditions. Before administration, subjects were admitted to a clinical research unit and study drug was administed by an anesthesiologist. Continuous vital signs monitoring was employed during and for 4 h following treatment. The primary efficacy outcome measure was change from baseline in the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h following KET, compared to PBO. Response and remission rates at 24 h represented secondary outcomes. Clinical response was defined as MADRS decrease ≥ 50% from baseline and remission was defined as a MADRS score of ≤9. To assess hemodynamic side effects, vital signs were monitored and clinically significant changes were defined as systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) 4180/100 or 420% increase above baseline level or tachycardia with heart rate 4110 beats/min. Management by medication interventions and treatment discontinuation was to be provided for significant hemodynamic changes. Other secondary outcomes included general adverse events, acute psychotomimetic effects, and dissociative effects, measured with the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) respectively. Results: Subjects evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo (t=4.4, p<0.001). Following KET, 8 of 19 subjects responded (42%), compared to 2 of 19 (11%) following PBO. Among study completers (those who received both treatment conditions), 8 (44%) met the response criterion. Of these 8, 1 (6%) also responded to placebo, while no completer met response criteria only for placebo (p=0.0325 based on McNemar's test). Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with few side effects. Specifically, following ketamine, the mean increase in BPRS was 0.3, and in CADSS was 1.37. No patient exhibited clinically significant changes in hemodynamics. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated a rapid antidepressant effect of IN ketamine in patients with TRD. IN KET was well tolerated with almost no psychotmimetic or dissociative side effects and with no significant hemodynamic effects including blood pressure and heart rate changes. No interventions by anesthesiology were needed. Future studies are indicated to identify strategies for maintaining antidepressant response in patients who respond to intranasal ketamine."

This study reports on the body image of depressed psychiatric outpatients, and the impact thereon of a dance movement therapy (DMT) group. Body image is perceived as a tri-partite construct consisting of image-properties, body-self, and body memory. Depressed patients in an outpatient mental health service participated in a DMT group treatment consisting of twelve 90-min long sessions in groups of 4–7 patients. Patients (N = 18) responded to a structured Body Image Assessment (BIA) before and after the treatment. Initially, the depressed patients’ body image was characterized by fragmentation, distortions, and shallowness of body awareness. The DMT group treatment aimed to offer the patients a safe space for exploring their embodied experiences in a validating social setting. This produced positive changes in the body image: finding a better sensation of one's body, tolerating the sensations, settling in the body, finding pleasure and meaningfulness in the experiences. BIA scores indicated large effect sizes in the change between pre- and post-treatment assessments. Change for more positive body image during the treatment predicted fewer depressive symptoms at the follow-up measurement."
"5292","0","A novel approach to the identification of psychiatric drugs: Serotonin-glutamate interactions in the prefrontal cortex.^
Activation of neocortical 5-hydroxytryptamine(2A) (5-HT(2A)) receptors is thought to mediate the profound psychomimetic effects of hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD and mescaline. These effects include alteration in mood, perception, and cognition. Conversely, blockade of neocortical 5-HT(2A) receptor may be related to the thymoleptic effects of newly released antidepressant (e.g., mirtazepine, nefazodone) and atypical antipsychotic drugs (e.g., risperidone, olanzapine). Therefore, one strategy to develop novel antidepressant drugs might be to identify drugs which suppress the effects of 5-HT(2A) receptor activation in key neurocircuits. Electrophysiological experiments using in vitro rat slices of the medial prefrontal cortex have found that activation of 5-HT(2A) receptors results in glutamate release from thalamocortical terminals by a novel focal effect. A number of monoamine (5-HT(1/7)), β2), metabotropic glutamate (mGlu2), and neuropeptide (μ-opioid) receptors suppress the glutamate release induced by 5-HT(2A) receptor activation. Clinical studies examining the effects of serotonin or catecholamine depletion suggest the activation of 5-HT or catecholamine receptors mediate the therapeutic effects of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), respectively. In addition, opiate agonists may have antidepressant properties. Therefore, it is suggested that elucidation of the specific receptors that suppress glutamate release induced by 5-HT(2A) receptor activation in the medial prefrontal cortex may have several effects. First, this might lead to a more complete understanding of the 5-HT receptor(s) that mediate the therapeutic effects of presently used drugs such as SSRIs. This site might be a therapeutic target free of side effects such as sexual dysfunction. Second, this strategy might lead to novel therapeutic targets for depression, such as metabotropic glutamate agonists which may not be efficacious in screening strategies primarily dependent on synaptic availability of monoaminergic neurotransmitters."
"7100","0","Empirically validated theoretical analysis of visual-spatial perception under change of nervous system arousal.^
Introduction: Visual-spatial perception is a process for extracting the spatial relationship between objects in the environment. The changes in visual-spatial perception due to factors such as the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperactivation) or parasympathetic nervous system (hypoactivation) can affect the internal representation of the external visual-spatial world. We formulated a quantitative model of the modulation of visual-perceptual space under action by hyperactivation or hypoactivation-inducing neuromodulating agents. We showed a Hill equation based relationship between neuromodulator agent concentration and alteration of visual-spatial perception utilizing the metric tensor to quantify the visual space. Methods: We computed the dynamics of the psilocybin (hyperactivation-inducing agent) and chlorpromazine (hypoactivation-inducing agent) in brain tissue. Then, we validated our quantitative model by analyzing the findings of different independent behavioral studies where subjects were assessed for alterations in visual-spatial perception under the action of psilocybin and under chlorpromazine. To validate the neuronal correlates, we simulated the effect of the neuromodulating agent on the computational model of the grid-cell network, and also performed diffusion MRI-based tractography to find the neural tracts between the cortical areas involved: V2 and the entorhinal cortex. Results: We applied our computational model to an experiment (where perceptual alterations were measured under psilocybin) and found that for n (Hill-coefficient) = 14.8 and k = 1.39, the theoretical prediction followed experimental observations very well (χ2 test robustly satisfied, p > 0.99). We predicted the outcome of another psilocybin-based experiment using these values (n = 14.8 and k = 1.39), whereby our prediction and experimental outcomes were well corroborated. Furthermore, we found that also under hypoactivation (chlorpromazine), the modulation of the visual-spatial perception follows our model. Moreover, we found neural tracts between the area V2 and entorhinal cortex, thus providing a possible brain network responsible for encoding visual-spatial perception. Thence, we simulated the altered grid-cell network activity, which was also found to follow the Hill equation. Conclusion: We developed a computational model of visuospatial perceptual alterations under altered neural sympathetic/parasympathetic tone. We validated our model using analysis of behavioral studies, neuroimaging assessment, and neurocomputational evaluation. Our quantitative approach may be probed as a potential behavioral screening and monitoring methodology in neuropsychology to analyze perceptual misjudgment and mishaps by highly stressed workers."

OBJECTIVE: An ever-increasing number of novel psychoactive substances are being detected worldwide. These emerging drugs have been demonstrated to cause toxicity in clusters, and deaths have been reported. We urgently need to learn more about their effects. We report the protocol for the Western Australian Illicit Substance Evaluation (WISE) study, a research project investigating illicit drug use in the ED. METHODS: Patients can be enrolled if the treating clinician strongly suspects they are currently intoxicated with a stimulant, hallucinogenic or cannabinoid drug; and an i.v. cannula or blood tests are required for routine clinical care. Patients are enrolled under a waiver of consent. A single additional blood tube is collected, de-identified and frozen on site. A temporary link between patient identification number and study identification number is retained for up to 10 business days post-hospital discharge to allow for clinical data collection, before this is destroyed and the patients become permanently de-identified. Samples are transported for external liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis in batches once de-identified. RESULTS: The key outcome will be identification of any psychoactive drugs present in the blood sample, together with their respective concentration. This will be linked to the clinical effects, as well as being compared with the substance the patient believed they had taken. CONCLUSION: We consider the novel approach outlined forms a template for an early warning system for emerging drugs of concern, while also providing vital and comprehensive information on current drugs of abuse, their clinical effects and their impact on the health system."
"8843","1","Psilocybin-Mediated Attenuation of Gamma Band Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSR) Is Driven by the Intensity of Cognitive and Emotional Domains of Psychedelic Experience.^
Psilocybin is a classical serotoninergic psychedelic that induces cognitive disruptions similar to psychosis. Gamma activity is affected in psychosis and is tightly related to cognitive processing. The 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) are frequently used as indicators to test the ability to generate gamma activity. Based on previous literature, we studied the impact of psilocybin on 40 Hz ASSR in healthy volunteers. The study was double blind and placebo controlled with a crossover design. A sample of 20 healthy subjects (10M/10F) received psilocybin orally 0.26 mg/kg or placebo. Participants were measured four times in total, one time before ingestion of psilocybin/placebo and one time after ingestion, during the peak of intoxication. A series of 500 ms click trains were used for stimulation. Psilocybin induced a psychedelic effect and decreased 40 Hz ASSR phase-locking index compared to placebo. The extent of the attenuation was related to Cognition and Affect on the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. The current study shows that psilocybin lowers the synchronization level and the amplitude of 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses, which yields further support for the role of gamma oscillations in cognitive processing and its disturbance."

INTRODUCTION: Two off-label use of ketamine are framed by recommendations: in intractable pain in palliative situations or in postoperative pain. Ketamine is used in hospital but can also be used outside hospital with dispensations by hospital pharmacy to outpatients. Few data are available on ketamine use outside hospital. In this context, the French Addictovigilance Network has set up a study with hospital pharmacies. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This survey assesses ketamine dispensations from 1 January to 30 April 2019, for patients who have an administration of ketamine outside hospital. RESULTS: Sixty-five (65) hospital pharmacies have dispensed ketamine for 553 patients. Ketamine was indicated within non-palliative care in 86% of cases. Most of non-cancer pain were in fibromyalgia (44%) and neuropathic pain (29%). During the 4-month monitoring period, 1352 dispensations were analysed. The frequency of administration is daily in 91% of cases within palliative care whereas it is much more diverse within non-palliative care (33% daily, more than 15 different frequency in fibromyalgia). Within palliative care, ketamine is most administered intravenously or by Patient Controlled Analgesia or syringe pump (78% of cases) whereas in non-palliative care, ketamine is most used subcutaneously (44%), orally (32%) or both subcutaneously and orally (20%). A large number of ampoules could be dispensed (more than 30 ampoules for 10% of dispensations). CONCLUSION: These data highlighted that recommendation in pain are not respected because most of ketamine is used within non-palliative care context and it should be noted a great heterogeneity of practice. This study underlines the urgency of targeted and clear information on certain off-label uses of ketamine for which no robust clinical studies are available and for which the risk of health complications like psychiatric (addiction), urologic and hepatologic complications is proven."

(+/-)-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') abusers have persistent neuropsychiatric deficits including memory impairments after the cessation of abuse. On the other hand, cannabinoid CB1 receptors have been implicated in learning/memory, and are highly expressed in the hippocampus, a region of the brain believed to have an important function in certain forms of learning and memory. In this study, we clarified the mechanism underlying the cognitive impairment that develops during MDMA withdrawal from the standpoint of the cannabinoid CB1 receptors. Mice were administered MDMA (10 mg/kg, i.p.) once a day for 7 days. On the 7th day of withdrawal, a novel object recognition task was performed and the amount of cannabinoid CB1 receptor protein was measured with western blotting. Recognition performance was impaired on the 7th day of withdrawal. This impairment was blocked by AM251, a cannabinoid CB1 receptor antagonist, administered 30 min before the training trial or co-administered with MDMA. At this time, the level of cannabinoid CB1 receptor protein increased significantly in the hippocampus but not the prefrontal cortex or striatum. This increase of CB1 receptor protein in the hippocampus was also blocked by the co-administration of AM251. Furthermore, CB1 receptor knockout mice showed no impairment of recognition performance on the withdrawal from MDMA. The impairment of recognition memory during withdrawal from MDMA may result from the activation of cannabinoid CB1 receptors in the hippocampus.

Rationale: Perampanel (PER) is a selective, noncompetitive AMPAantagonist approved as adjunctive treatment for partial‐onset seizures. PER is the first approved drug in the novel pharmacologic class of AMPA‐glutamate antagonists. To address potential for abuse of PER, 2 studies, designed according to current abuse liability guidelines, were conducted in recreational polydrug users. Methods: Study 1: double‐blind (DB), ascending single‐dose exploratory study of PER in 56 adults with history of psychedelic drug use and use of CNS depressants, opiates, stimulants or cannabinoids. Subjects were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 treatment groups (PER or placebo): 8 then 16mg; 12 then 20mg; 24 then 32mg; 28 then 36mg. Study 2: 40 adults with history of psychedelic drug and CNS depressant use included. Subjects received single oral dose treatments in randomized, DB, crossover manner (1 at each treatment period), of PER(8, 24 & 36mg), Schedule IV alprazolam(1.5 & 3mg), Schedule III ketamine(100mg) and placebo. Each subject had 10 treatment periods (6 active; 1 randomized placebo; 3 washout placebos). Primary pharmacodynamic (PD) endpoints included positive effects (Addiction Research Center Inventory [ARCI] Morphine Benzedrine Group [MBG] scale), balance of effects (Drug Liking Visual Analog Scale [VAS] and Subjective Drug Value [SDV]) and sedative effects (ARCI Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol Group [PCAG] scale). Secondary endpoints included Bad Drug Effects, Overall Drug Liking and Take Drug Again VASs. Results: Study 1 exploratory results provided the basis for selection of Study 2 doses. Table 1 shows Study 2 primary PD results. Alprazolam doses and ketamine were each associated with higher positive and balance peak effects (maximum effect, Emax) compared to placebo (p?0.001), confirming study validity. All PER doses were associated with higher positive, balance and sedative effects (Emax) compared to placebo (p<0.01 for 8mg; p<0.001 for 24 & 36mg). PER therapeutic dose (8mg) was associated with lower ARCI MBG, SDV and ARCI PCAG Emax compared to alprazolam doses (p<0.05) and lower ACRI MBG, Drug Liking VAS and SDV Emax compared to ketamine (p<0.001). Compared to alprazolam doses, PER 24 & 36mg doses were not statistically different on primary endpoints. Secondary endpoints showed greater Bad Drug Effects Emax (p<0.01 except PER 24mg vs alprazolam 3mg) but lower Overall Drug Liking and Take Drug Again VASs (p=ns). Compared to ketamine, PER 24 and 36mg doses showed greater ARCI PCAG and Bad Drug Emax (p<0.001) but lower Drug Liking, Overall Drug Liking and Take Drug Again Emax (p<0.05); all PER doses also showed slower onset and longer duration of effect vs ketamine. Conclusions: Dose‐related elevations were demonstrated in several measures of drug liking relative to placebo, indicating that supratherapeutic doses of PER may have some level of abuse potential. At therapeutic dose (8mg), PER showed statistically lower effects compared to alprazolam and ketamine on most measures. It is unlikely that therapeutic doses (4‐12mg) of PER are associated with significant risk of drug abuse. Table 1.

"1946","0","Psilocybin for treating substance use disorders?.^
Evidence based treatment for Substance use disorders (SUD) includes psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy. However, these are only partially effective. Hallucinogens, such as psilocybin, may represent potential new treatment options for SUD. This review provides a summary of (human) studies on the putative therapeutic effects of psilocybin, and discusses the receptor systems, brain regions and cognitive and emotional processes mediating psilocybin's effects. Psilocybin's chemical structure is similar to that of serotonin. Dysregulations in the serotonin system are associated with alterations in stress hormones, such as cortisol, and mood disorders. After psilocybin administration cortisol levels spike and activate the executive control network, with subsequent increased control over emotional processes, and relief of negative thinking and persistent negative emotions. Preliminary data of ongoing alcohol and smoking addiction studies in humans shows promising effects of psilocybin administration on substance use. Importantly, psilocybin has a low risk of toxicity and dependence and can be used safely under controlled clinical conditions. Areas covered: This paper is a narrative review based on the search terms: psilocybin, substance use disorder, addiction, depression, serotonin. Literature on potential efficacy and mechanisms of action of psilocybin in SUD is discussed. Expert commentary: Recent positive findings with psilocybin need confirmation in well-designed placebo controlled randomized trials employing a large sample size."

Renaissance of a problem child – psychedelics in the treatment of depression. Since the 1990s, psychedelics experience a renaissance in biomedical research. Classical psychedelics include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, mescaline and ayahuasca. Characteristic subjective effects such as alterations of emotion- and self-processing, as well as dream-like visionary states are primarily mediated via cortical serotonin 2A receptor activation. The novel psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy comprises of sporadic guided experiences with the above mentioned substances, which are integrated in a continuous psychotherapy. First randomized-controlled studies using psilocybin in patients with unipolar depression show a favorable safety profile, good therapy adherence and promising therapeutic effects. The so-called atypical psychedelics represent a large and heterogeneous group of substances, which share comparable subjective effects, while differing regarding their molecular mechanisms. Examples are 3,4-methylendioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA), ketamine and gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB). Intranasal esketamine, an enantiomer of ketamine, was internationally approved for the treatment of therapy-resistant depression in 2020. If the other classical and atypical psychedelics will meet current expectations and be included into clinical practice in the near future, depends on further, larger clinical studies. Moreover, such an implementation will also require significant modifications of treatment settings and the medicolegal environment."
"7148","0","The minor cannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG) is a highly specific blood biomarker of recent cannabis smoking.^
INTRODUCTION: The determination of recent cannabis use is of forensic interest in the investigation of automotive crashes, workplace incidents and other mishaps. Because Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol may persist in blood after psychoactive effects of intoxication resolve, particularly in regular users, short-lived minor cannabinoids such as cannabigerol have merited examination as adjunct indicators of recent cannabis inhalation. METHODS: As part of an observational cohort study, whole blood cannabinoids including cannabigerol were measured in whole blood by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at baseline, and 30 minutes after initiation of a 15-minute supervised interval of ad libitum cannabis smoking in occasional (1-2 days/week over the past 30 days) (n = 24) and daily cannabis smokers (n = 32). Per protocol, subjects self-reported abstention from inhaling cannabis (>8 h) or ingesting cannabis (>12 h) prior to baseline measurement. RESULTS: At baseline, none of the occasional users had detectable cannabigerol (limit of detection = 0.2 µg/L), whereas cannabigerol was detectable post-smoking in 7 of 24 (29%). Among daily cannabis users, 2 of 32 (6%) had detectable cannabigerol at baseline, increasing to 21 of 32 (66%) post-smoking. The odds ratio for recent cannabis smoking associated with a detectable cannabigerol was 27 (95% confidence interval: 6.6, 110.3). In this mixed cohort of occasional and daily cannabis users, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that whole blood cannabigerol concentration of ≥ 0.2 µg/L had 96% specificity, 50% sensitivity, and 73% accuracy for identifying a 15-minute interval of ad libitum cannabis smoking initiated 30 minutes earlier. Post smoking blood Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (median = 5.6 µg/L in occasional users, 21.3 µg/L in daily users) was significantly correlated with post-smoking cannabigerol (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Whole blood cannabigerol may have forensic utility as a highly specific albeit insensitive biomarker of recent cannabis smoking."
"3555","1","The effects of ketamine on symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world care settings: A retrospective controlled analysis.^
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine intravenous therapy (KIT) appears effective for treating depression in controlled trials testing a short series of infusions. A rapidly proliferating number of clinics offer KIT for depression and anxiety, using protocols without a strong evidence basis. Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017-03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies. RESULTS: Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d = -1.17 and d = -1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d = -1.03 and d = -0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal. LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses, interpreting this dataset is limited by incomplete patient information and sample attrition. CONCLUSIONS: KIT treatment elicited robust symptomatic relief that remained stable up to one year of follow-up."
"8241","0","Subjective and objective evidence of low abuse potential of the peripherally-acting kappa opioid, CR845, compared with pentazocine.^
Aims: CR845, a potent, peripherally‐acting, selective kappa opioid, is being developed for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. The primary objective of the trial was to measure the relative abuse potential of 2 doses of CR845 compared to an intravenous (iv) dose of pentazocine, a Schedule IV opioid analgesic with mixed mu and kappa opioid activity. Methods: Recreational polydrug users with opioid and hallucinogenic drug experience were enrolled in this single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, active‐ and placebo‐controlled study. Subjects (N = 39) received a single bolus iv dose of the following 4 treatments in a balanced Williams crossover design, with 48‐hour washout periods: CR845 5 mcg/kg (therapeutic dose), CR845 15 mcg/kg (supra‐therapeutic dose), placebo, and pentazocine 0.5 mg/kg. In addition to subjective measures of drug abuse liability, changes in pupillary diameter were measured. Results: The primary measure of “drug liking” Emax on a visual analog scale (VAS) for CR845 was significantly lower than pentazocine (p < .0001). Similarly, the VAS scores for “drug liking” and drug effect “high” for CR845 were lower than those for pentazocine over the entire 8‐hour observation period. In addition, “overall drug liking” and “take drug again” VAS scores were lower for CR845 compared to pentazocine (p < .0001) and were equivalent to placebo. Pentazocine produced a decrease in the mean pupillary diameter compared with no change with either dose of CR845 or placebo (p < .0001). Conclusions: This study provides evidence that CR845 exhibits substantially less abuse potential than pentazocine. The lack of effect of CR845 on pupillary diameter is consistent with preclinical studies demonstrating an absence of CNS mu opioid activity, which further supports a low abuse potential compared with mu opioids."
"6870","1","Intranasal ketamine for acute Cluster headache attacks-Results from a proof-of-concept open label trial.^
Background and objective: Acute treatment options for Cluster headache patients who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited. Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a Cluster headache attack but never systematically tested. Methods: We conducted an open‐label pilot study in which 20 chronic Cluster headache patients according to International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd were treated during one cluster headache attack with intranasal ketamine. Under in‐hospital observation patients received 15 mg ketamine by intranasal spray every six minutes a maximum of five times. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction of pain intensity within 15 minutes after initiating treatment. Results: The primary endpoint was not met. However, 30 minutes after first application the pain intensity was reduced by 59% from 7.25 ± 1.24 to 2.94 ± 3.40 on a 1 1 points numeric rating scale (mean, SD, p = 0.0002) and 11 out of 16 (69%) scored four or below on the numeric rating scale. Exactly, half the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection and complete relief was self‐reported by 8 out of 20 patients (40%). No serious advense events were identified during the trial. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment of cluster headache within 30 minutes but should be tested in a larger controlled design. Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine."
"4000","0","Mechanisms and molecular targets surrounding the potential therapeutic effects of psychedelics.^
Psychedelics, also known as classical hallucinogens, have been investigated for decades due to their potential therapeutic effects in the treatment of neuropsychiatric and substance use disorders. The results from clinical trials have shown promise for the use of psychedelics to alleviate symptoms of depression and anxiety, as well as to promote substantial decreases in the use of nicotine and alcohol. While these studies provide compelling evidence for the powerful subjective experience and prolonged therapeutic adaptations, the underlying molecular reasons for these robust and clinically meaningful improvements are still poorly understood. Preclinical studies assessing the targets and circuitry of the post-acute effects of classical psychedelics are ongoing. Current literature is split between a serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor (5-HT(2A)R)-dependent or -independent signaling pathway, as researchers are attempting to harness the mechanisms behind the sustained post-acute therapeutically relevant effects. A combination of molecular, behavioral, and genetic techniques in neuropharmacology has begun to show promise for elucidating these mechanisms. As the field progresses, increasing evidence points towards the importance of the subjective experience induced by psychedelic-assisted therapy, but without further cross validation between clinical and preclinical research, the why behind the experience and its translational validity may be lost."
"5628","1","An encounter with the self: A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^
INTRODUCTION: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates, especially given the ""disconnected consciousness"" suggested by the ""breakthrough"" DMT state. Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience's qualitative content, over and above the phenomenological structure. This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self, which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative. METHODS: This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymized, and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75-mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews, inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique, were employed immediately after their experience. This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the ""self""; where analyses of the ""other"" were previously reported. A total of 36 post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) men (eight women) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. RESULTS: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects, encompassing super-ordinate themes including sensory, emotion and body, and space-time shifts; the second category comprised bodily effects, encompassing themes including pleasurable, neutral/both, and uncomfortable; the third category comprised the sensorial effects, encompassing open-eye, visual, and cross-modal and other; the fourth comprised the psychological effects, encompassing memory and language, awareness and sense of self, and time distortions; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects, encompassing positive, neither/both, and challenging experiences. Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one's personal and self-referential experiences of the body, senses, psychology, and emotions. The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences, such as the alien abduction, shamanic and near-death experiences, are also elaborated upon. Putative neural mechanisms and their promise as a psychotherapeutic agent, especially owing to deep emotional impact, are discussed."

INTERVENTION: The study consists of a screening visit, a treatment phase of one study period and a final visit/early termination visit (ETV). For each subject, two DHEP‐Heparin medicated plasters are applied concurrently as follows: one plaster without reinforcement (PW) and one plaster with reinforcement (PR) are applied to the right and left side of the upper back (dorsal region, below the scapula), with the longer side parallel to the spine, at the same height, as near as possible to the spine. Plaster for PR treatment was reinforced using small pieces of tape applied to the four corners of the DHEP‐Heparin plaster. The investigator assesses each plaster adhesion at 4, 8, 12, 16, 20 and 24 h post‐application using the following 5‐point scale, according to the FDA Guidance for Assessing adhesion. In addition, at each time point, when adhesion was assessed on the 5‐point scale, the actual percentage adherence value (%) was estimated by the investigator and reported in the CRF. The two assessments (score and actual percentage evaluation) are visually performed by a an experienced and trained scorer (the Principal Investigator) who was previously involved as investigator in several clinical trials where visual evaluation of patch detached area was part of study assessments. Standardised digital photographs are taken before application and at each assessment time for each plaster. After adhesion assessment and photograph, at each assessment time the shapes of attachment/detachment area of each plaster were traced on an acetate sheet in order to collect an additional image of the detached area of each plaster. Each plaster contained 181 mg DHEP corresponding to 140 mg diclofenac sodium. Therefore, the subjects are exposed to a total dose of approximately 280 mg diclofenac sodium.

"9455","1","Ketamine effects on default mode network activity and vigilance: A randomized, placebo‐controlled crossover simultaneous fMRI/EEG study.^
In resting‐state functional connectivity experiments, a steady state (of consciousness) is commonly supposed. However, recent research has shown that the resting state is a rather dynamic than a steady state. In particular, changes of vigilance appear to play a prominent role. Accordingly, it is critical to assess the state of vigilance when conducting pharmacodynamic studies with resting‐state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) using drugs that are known to affect vigilance such as (subanesthetic) ketamine. In this study, we sought to clarify whether the previously described ketamine‐induced prefrontal decrease of functional connectivity is related to diminished vigilance as assessed by electroencephalography (EEG). We conducted a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover study with subanesthetic S‐Ketamine in N = 24 healthy, young subjects by simultaneous acquisition of resting‐state fMRI and EEG data. We conducted seed‐based default mode network functional connectivity and EEG power spectrum analyses. After ketamine administration, decreased functional connectivity was found in medial prefrontal cortex whereas increased connectivities were observed in intraparietal cortices. In EEG, a shift of energy to slow (delta, theta) and fast (gamma) wave frequencies was seen in the ketamine condition. Frontal connectivity is negatively related to EEG gamma and theta activity while a positive relationship is found for parietal connectivity and EEG delta power. Our results suggest a direct relationship between ketamine‐induced functional connectivity changes and the concomitant decrease of vigilance in EEG. The observed functional changes after ketamine administration may serve as surrogate end points and provide a neurophysiological framework, for example, for the antidepressant action of ketamine (trial name: 29JN1556, EudraCT Number: 2009‐012399‐28).

"9607","1","[Topographic electroencephalometry following anesthesia induction with ketamine-midazolam].^
The neurophysiological action of ketamine has attracted increasing interest in recent years, with special interest in receptor action and in neurophysiological differences between and psychomimetic side effects of the two enantiomorphs. Most of the neurophysiological examinations published deal with ketamine as a single anaesthetic agent, although it has been suggested to that psychomimetic side-effects and haemodynamic deterioration could be avoided by combining ketamine with a sedative drug. The primary aim of our study was to examine the combined ketamine-midazolam action on cerebral activity; secondly, we planned to look at these interactions topographically at different points of the cortex to evaluate topographical differences in the combination's action; thirdly, the cerebral and haemodynamic reactions to anaesthesiological stimuli (intubation, gastric tube) were evaluated and compared. METHODS. Sixteen patients scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were examined. Topographical electroencephalometric data were obtained by processed EEG with a CATEEM system at 17 recording points over the cortex and compared with heart rate and arterial blood pressure during the induction period. After documentation of the baseline data ketamine (3 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) were applied within 10 min by means of an automatic device. At the end of the infusion period patients were intubated, and after a further 10 min a gastric tube was placed. RESULTS. Induction resulted in increases in delta and beta 2 output (P < 0.05) in the early induction period and in significant decreases (P < 0.05) in alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 1 activity. No significant change in theta activity was observed throughout the observation period. Intubation led to significant increases of power particularly in the temporal and parietal leads of all frequency bands, but not in the frontal area. Insertion of the gastric tube did not alter cerebral function. CONCLUSION. The interaction of ketamine and midazolam leads to increases in beta 2 and delta power and to significant decreases in the alpha bands and beta 1. Increases of theta activity, a typical effect of single-agent anaesthesia with ketamine, were not observed. Thus, the action of combined ketamine and midazolam on cerebral function is not an additive, but an interactive process. Despite a relatively high induction dosage, haemodynamic changes during intubation occurred and were accompanied by changes in cerebral activity. This can be regarded as incomplete cerebral suppression even by these induction dosages."

OBJECTIVE: User surveys show that there have been significant changes over the last decade in the recreational drugs that are available and being used. This study aims to determine whether there have been similar trends in the drug(s) used by individuals presenting to the emergency department (ED) with acute recreational drug toxicity. METHODS: Data on all poisoned patients presenting to our large inner-city ED are recorded prospectively on a dedicated clinical toxicology database. Presentations relating to the use of classical recreational drugs and/or novel psychoactive substances were identified retrospectively between 1 January 2006 and 31 December 2010. RESULTS: There was a significant increase between 2006 and 2010 in the number of individuals reporting the use of cocaine (119-222), γ-hydroxybutyrate/γ- butyrolactone (158-270), ketamine (58-81) and cannabis (18-68) and novel psychoactive substances (seven to 98). In particular, there was an increase in cathinones reported from none in 2006 to 82 in 2010. Only 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) was associated with a downward trend in reported use from 140 in 2006 to 103 in 2010. CONCLUSION: Data collection on the drug(s) used in individuals presenting to specialist clinical toxicology centres and/or sentinel EDs across Europe with acute recreational drug toxicity would help to determine the true pattern(s) of drug use and the acute harm associated with this use across Europe and trends over time. © 2013 Wolters Kluwer Health | Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

The aim of this study was to examine rave-related polydrug drug use and to determine if patterns of substance use were associated with previous rave attendance. One hundred and eighty-six rave attendees (50% female) representing a wide range of ages (16 to 47 years; mean = 23.5, sd = 5.15) and levels of rave attendance experience (1 to 400 events) completed structured interviews in Montreal, Canada between November 2002 and September 2003 about their rave attendance patterns and their use of various licit and illicit substances at the most recently attended event. On average, participants reported using 2.5 different psychoactive substances (excluding tobacco) at the most recent event attended. Cannabis, alcohol, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine, and GHB were the most frequently reported substances, and details about their orders of administration, dosages, and patterns of co-administration are presented and discussed. The total lifetime number of raves attended by participants varied considerably (mean = 48.6; sd = 69.7; median = 25), and there was a positive correlation between the number events attended and number of substances used at the most recent event attended (p < 0.001). Analyses revealed that individuals reporting the use of ketamine, GHB, and/or cocaine at the most recent event had attended significantly more events than nonusers even when controlling for various demographic variables. A subset of respondents (n = 27) completed a second interview to determine the reliability of their responses. Results indicated that respondents could reliably recall details about which drugs were used, the total doses administered, as well as order of drug administration.

Cannabis has been suggested to impair the capacity to recognize discrepancies between expected and executed actions. However, there is a lack of conclusive evidence regarding the acute impact of cannabis on the neural correlates of error monitoring. In order to contribute to the available knowledge, we used a randomized, double-blind, between-groups design to investigate the impact of administration of a low (5.5 mg THC) or high (22 mg THC) dose of vaporized cannabis vs. placebo on the amplitudes of the error-related negativity (ERN) and error positivity (Pe) in the context of the Flanker task, in a group of frequent cannabis users (required to use cannabis minimally 4 times a week, for at least 2 years). Subjects in the high dose group (n=18) demonstrated a significantly diminished ERN in comparison to the placebo condition (n=19), whereas a reduced Pe amplitude was observed in both the high and low dose (n=18) conditions, as compared to placebo. The results suggest that a high dose of cannabis may affect the neural correlates of both the conscious (late), as well as the initial automatic processes involved in error monitoring, while a low dose of cannabis might impact only the conscious (late) processing of errors."

Suckow, Thomas B. Cooper and J. John Mann (Journal of Psychiatric Research, 2019[Oct], Vol 117, 129-134). In the original article, there was an error in Figure 1 which shows the amine and aryl group moved one carbon over on the cyclohexanone structure whereas they should be next to the ketone. A corrected Figure 1 can be found in the NIHMS manuscript, but was too late for the journal publication. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-49924-018[/rid]). Ketamine shows promise as a rapidly-acting treatment for depression and suicidal ideation, but side effects and abuse potential limit its use. Understanding its mechanism of action could help develop analogous but safer drugs. This post hoc study explored relationships of ketamine and metabolites, including hydroxynorketamine enantiomers, (2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-HNK, to clinical response in a subgroup from a published trial in suicidal depression. Depressed adults with clinically significant suicidal ideation were randomized to double-blind infusion of sub-anesthetic ketamine or midazolam. Ketamine and metabolites were measured after infusion (N = 53). Plasma (2R,6R)-HNK was associated with change (higher levels correlated with less clinical improvement) from baseline to 24 h post-infusion of depression (HDRS-24: Spearman r = 0.37, p = 0.009) and suicidal thoughts (SSI: Spearman r = 0.29, p = 0.041). There were similar correlations with weekly follow-up clinical rating scores for both HNK enantiomers and dehydronorketamine (DHNK). Ketamine and norketamine were not associated with change in depression or suicidal ideation (unadjusted p > 0.28). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"4501","0","Assessing potential of psilocybin for depressive disorders.^
INTRODUCTION: There has been increasing interest in the role psilocybin may play in the treatment of depressive disorders. Several clinical trials have shown psilocybin to have efficacy in reducing symptoms of depression. AREASCOVERED: We discuss the current understanding of psilocybin's therapeutic mechanism of action and review existing clinical data investigating psilocybin as a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of depression. EXPERT OPINION: There is still much unknown regarding the risks of psilocybin treatment. When weighing the known risks and benefits of psilocybin treatment against those found in existing standards of care, among patients with depression, patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) may be the most suitable candidates for psilocybin treatment at this time."
"2656","0","Hallucinogenic Persisting Perception Disorder: A Case Series and Review of the Literature.^
BACKGROUND: Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is characterized by the re-emergence of perceptual symptoms experienced during acute hallucinogen intoxication following drug cessation. The underlying pathophysiology is poorly understood. We report the clinical characteristics and investigation findings of a series of HPPD cases with a literature review of previous case reports. We draw parallels between the features of HPPD and Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS). METHODS: Retrospective case series of 13 patients referred from neuro-ophthalmologists. Literature review with 24 HPPD case reports were identified through database search using the terms ""hallucinogenic persisting perception disorder"" OR ""hallucinogen persisting perception disorder."" RESULTS: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-Methyl enedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) and cannabinoid use was common. Cannabinoids and MDMA were mostly used in association with classical hallucinogens. The most frequent symptoms in our patients were visual snow, floaters, palinopsia, photophobia and nyctalopia. In the literature other symptoms included visual hallucinations altered motion perception, palinopsia, tracers and color enhancement. Ophthalmic and neurologic investigations were mostly normal. The majority of patients had ongoing symptoms. Two of our patients fully recovered-one after treatment with benzodiazepine and one without treatment. Twenty-five percent of cases from the literature fully recovered. CONCLUSIONS: HPPD presents with heterogeneous visual phenomena on a background of previous classic and non-classic hallucinogen use. Ophthalmic investigations are typically normal. The symptoms of HPPD in our case series overlap with the typical features of Visual Snow Syndrome (VSS). Patients presenting with VSS should be screened for past recreational drug use. The DSM-5 description of HPPD does not include visual snow, nyctalopia, photophobia or floaters. A revision of the diagnostic criteria to include these symptoms may better reflect the typical clinical phenotype. Increased awareness of HPPD as a secondary cause of VSS can avoid extensive investigations. Controlled trials comparing primary and secondary VSS patients are needed to understand the pathophysiology better and optimize treatment for HPPD."

BACKGROUND: Anxiety has negative effects on mental and physical performance, quality of life, duration of hospitalization, and even on the treatment of patients with cancer. OBJECTIVES: Today acupressure is widely used to treat anxiety. Thus, the present study aimed to investigate the effects of acupressure on anxiety in patients with cancer. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A double-blind randomized clinical trial was conducted on 85 patients hospitalized with 3 groups including acupressure group (n = 27), sham group (n = 28), and control group (n = 30) in the hematologic ward of Shahid Beheshti Hospital of Hamadan, Iran, in 2013. The sampling permuted-block randomization with triple block was used. The anxiety of the patients in the experimental, sham, and control groups were measured with Spielberger's State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). Then, real acupressure was performed in the experimental group and fake acupressure in the sham group, and only routine care was provided for the control group. Anxiety of the patients was also assessed at 5 and 10 days after the intervention. Statistical analysis of the data was performed by SPSS software using repeated measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) and post hoc least significant difference (LSD) test. RESULTS: According to the findings, the mean level of anxiety before the intervention between groups were matched (P > 0.05). Acupressure had a significant influence on the anxiety in the experimental group at 5 (45.30 ± 7.14) and 10 days (43.48 ± 6.82) after the intervention (P < 0.05). However, it did not have a significant impact on their covert anxiety (45.48 ± 7.92 at 5(th) day vs 45.63 ± 8.08 at 10th day, P > 0.05). No significant differences were observed in the fake points regarding overt and covert anxiety of patients in the sham group (overt anxiety; 47.57 ± 7.85 at 5(th) day vs. 46.71 ± 7.32 at 10(th) day, P > 0.05) (covert anxiety; 47.96 ± 6.33 at 5(th) day vs. 46.89 ± 6.94 at 10(th) day, P > 0.05). Moreover, the routine care provided for the control group did not have any effect on the overt and covert anxiety of the patients (P > 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Acupressure is recommended as a complementary therapy to reduce anxiety in patients with cancer because of its low cost, safety, and simplicity."
"751","1","Sex differences in ketamine's therapeutic effects for mood disorders: A systematic review.^
Replicated clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects with ketamine in treatment resistant mood disorders. Sex (biological) and gender differences in therapeutic effects for any new intervention is an important consideration, however, the differential efficacy, safety and tolerability of ketamine in males versus females remains underexplored. The objective of the present systematic review is to identify and qualitatively synthesize all published clinical studies relevant to the sex differential effects of ketamine for mood disorders. A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo from inception until January 20, 2021, yielded 27 reports including 1715 patients (742 males and 973 females) that met inclusion criteria. Results from the vast majority of studies (88.8%) do not support significant sex differences in antidepressant response, tolerability or safety of ketamine. Nine (33.3%) of the reports included a bioanalytical component in the analysis and only one reported on sex differences. Evidence from the present review does not support clinically or statistically significant sex differences in therapeutic effects with ketamine. Nevertheless, future studies should continue to consider sex and biological sex differences in study design and data analytic plans."
"941","1","Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^
Background: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects. We therefore recommend that future psilocybin research be conducted according to existing guidelines and include well-validated measures of cognition and creativity at multiple timepoints."

The time course of N,N dimethyltryptamine (DMT) levels in brain and liver of adult male Holtzman rats was determined with and without pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors iproniazid (32 mg/kg) and tranylcypromine (10 mg/kg) given i.p. DMT was given in doses of 1.0, 3.2, and 10.0 mg/kg i.p. DMT was assayed spectro photo fluorometrically and in some instances by a radioisotopic method. The results show that the half life of DMT varied with different doses in the brain but not in the liver. Pretreatment with the monoamine oxidase inhibitors prolonged the total period during which DMT was found. A linear relationship exists between the mean time required to reach minimal DMT concentrations and the mean duration of suppression of FR4 barpressing behavior in rats trained for a milk reward. The results suggest a direct involvement of DMT in inducing behavioral toxicity."
"1382","0","Inpatient suicide in psychiatric settings: Evaluation of current prevention measures.^
The risk of suicide in psychiatric hospitals is 50 times higher than in the general population, despite patient safety being a priority for any hospital. However, to date, due to the complexity of assessing suicide risk, there has been no consensus on the suicide prevention measures that should be in place in hospitals. The aim of this work is: To provide an overview of the progress that has been made in the field of inpatient suicide prevention in recent years; discuss the problems that remain; and suggest potential future developments. As new clinical dimensions (notably anhedonia, psychological pain and hopelessness) develop, they should become new therapeutic targets. Team training (like the Gatekeeper Training Program) and the latest advances in suicide risk assessment (such as the Collaborative Assessment and Management of Suicidality) should be implemented in psychiatric wards. Suicide prevention plans (e.g., ASSIP, SAFE-T, etc.) represent easy-to-administer, low-cost interventions. The Mental Health Environment of Care Checklist has been proven effective to reduce suicide risk at hospitals. Furthermore, the types of psychotherapy recommended to reduce suicide risk are cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and dialectical behavioral therapy (DBT). There are several pharmacological treatments for suicide risk, such as lithium and clozapine, which have been shown to be effective in the long term, as well as ketamine and esketamine, which are more effective in the short term. Following some encouraging recent results, buprenorphine may also be proposed to patients with a suicide risk. Triple chronotherapy rapidly improves depressive symptoms over 9 weeks. Regarding brain stimulation techniques, rTMS has proven to be effective in alleviating multiple dimensions of suicidality."
"9346","1","Estimating the prevalence of Ecstasy use among juvenile offenders.^
To date, no studies have examined Ecstasy use among criminal justice populations. Focusing on individuals under criminal justice supervision is useful because ""new"" illegal drugs will typically take root in a criminal population before diffusing to the general population. In the current study, self-report drug use data and urine specimens were collected from 209 juvenile offenders surveyed through Maryland's Offender Population Urinalysis Screening (OPUS) Program. Prevalence estimates are generated and associations between Ecstasy use, demographic characteristics, and alcohol and other drug use are explored. Sixteen percent of the sample reported using Ecstasy within the past 12 months, an estimate almost three times as high as grade school and high school students surveyed through the Monitoring the Future survey. Compared to nonusers, Ecstasy users were significantly more likely to be female (45% versus 20%, p<0.01), White (82% versus 22%, p<0.001), and out of school (39% versus 20%, p<0.05). Associations were also found between Ecstasy use and the use of other drugs. These findings suggest that the recent use of Ecstasy among juvenile offenders is higher than estimated use in the general student population, and that youthful offenders may represent an important population for potential intervention."
"2555","1","Breaking Sad: Unleashing the Breakthrough Potential of Ketamine's Rapid Antidepressant Effects.^
Preclinical Research The surprising results of a small clinical trial on the effects of low dose ketamine, a 65-year old anesthetic drug that is also used off-label for chronic pain and recreationally as a club drug, in eight depressed subjects unleashed the most significant advance in antidepressant drug development in decades. That study and subsequent ones have demonstrated that low dose, infused ketamine is able to induce a remission of depression in patients who have failed conventional medications, within 24 h. The apparent increased efficacy and rapid onset of effect of ketamine distinguish it from all other current antidepressant treatments. However, a single infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine produces benefits that typically last <3 weeks. The infusions are associated with a transient ""psychedelic"" experience and increased blood pressure that requires monitoring. There is also a theoretical potential to induce ketamine addiction. These features limit ketamine's ability to be a widely used treatment for depression and thus limit is ability to have a meaningful impact on the heavy morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, despite its ""breakthrough"" rate of efficacy and speed of action. While growing numbers of clinicians are using ketamine to treat treatment resistant depression, many in the depression field believe that the aforementioned limiting aspects need to be separated from its remarkable therapeutic effects in order to unlock the breakthrough potential of this agent. To that end, drug development efforts have focused on various features of ketamine as targets for optimization including its modulation of the NMDA receptor, its pharmacokinetics, its chirality and its active metabolites including HNK (2R, 6R)-hyroxynorketamine.

"6643","1","The effects of psilocybin on brain EEG activity and connectivity in healthy volunteers-focus on the dynamics of the psychedelic state.^
Introduction.‐ A serotonin 5‐HT2A/C agonist, psychedelic drug psilocybin, is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression. Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28‐50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale “altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)” at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

"9313","1","Discrete memory impairments in largely pure chronic users of MDMA.^
Chronic use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) has repeatedly been associated with deficits in working memory, declarative memory, and executive functions. However, previous findings regarding working memory and executive function are inconclusive yet, as in most studies concomitant stimulant use, which is known to affect these functions, was not adequately controlled for. Therefore, we compared the cognitive performance of 26 stimulant-free and largely pure (primary) MDMA users, 25 stimulant-using polydrug MDMA users, and 56 MDMA/stimulant-naïve controls by applying a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Neuropsychological tests were grouped into four cognitive domains. Recent drug use was objectively quantified by 6-month hair analyses on 17 substances and metabolites. Considerably lower mean hair concentrations of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine), opioids (morphine, methadone, codeine), and hallucinogens (ketamine, 2C-B) were detected in primary compared to polydrug users, while both user groups did not differ in their MDMA hair concentration. Cohen's d effect sizes for both comparisons, i.e., primary MDMA users vs. controls and polydrug MDMA users vs. controls, were highest for declarative memory (dprimary=.90, dpolydrug=1.21), followed by working memory (dprimary=.52, dpolydrug=.96), executive functions (dprimary=.46, dpolydrug=.86), and attention (dprimary=.23, dpolydrug=.70). Thus, primary MDMA users showed strong and relatively discrete declarative memory impairments, whereas MDMA polydrug users displayed broad and unspecific cognitive impairments. Consequently, even largely pure chronic MDMA use is associated with decreased performance in declarative memory, while additional deficits in working memory and executive functions displayed by polydrug MDMA users are likely driven by stimulant co-use."
"8704","1","Harm related to recreational ketamine use and its relevance for the clinical use of ketamine. A systematic review and comparison study.^
BACKGROUNDS: Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is currently considered for several new indications. AIM: To deduce the safety of long-term ketamine treatment using the harm of heavy recreational (non-medical) ketamine use as a proxy for maximal possible harm of ketamine treatment. METHODS: Systematic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines to identify controlled studies on ketamine-related harm in heavy recreational ketamine users. Results were compared with serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients treated with ketamine according to three systematic reviews considering dosing regimen and cumulative dose. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 25 studies. Heavy recreational ketamine use can escalate to ketamine dependency and was often dose-dependently associated with other SAEs, including cognitive and mental disorders, and gastrointestinal and urinary tract symptoms, which disappeared upon marked reduction of ketamine use. Heavy ketamine users have a much higher cumulative exposure to ketamine than ketamine treated patients (>90 times), which may explain why SAEs in the clinical context are mostly mild and reversible and why ketamine dependence was not reported in these patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with ketamine is not associated with ketamine dependency or SAEs. However, caution is needed since data on long-term clinical ketamine use with a long-term follow-up is lacking."
"7155","1","Effects of Naturalistic Psychedelic Use on Depression, Anxiety, and Well-Being: Associations With Patterns of Use, Reported Harms, and Transformative Mental States.^
Survey-based studies suggest naturalistic psychedelic use provides mental health benefits similar to those observed in clinical trials. The current study sought to confirm these findings in a large group of psychedelic users and to conduct a novel examination of associations between amount of psychedelic use and behavioral outcomes, as well as frequency of harms ascribed to psychedelic use. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 2,510 adults reporting at least one lifetime psychedelic experience. Participants retrospectively completed a battery of instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and emotional well-being prior to and following psychedelic exposure. Participants also reported preferred psychedelic agent, number of uses, and harms attributed to psychedelic use. Psychedelic use was associated with significant improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms and with increased emotional well-being. These improvements increased in magnitude with increasing psychedelic exposure, with a ceiling effect. However, improvements were noted following a single lifetime use. Strong evidence for benefit of one preferred psychedelic agent over another was not observed, but enduring increases in factors related to mystical-experience and prosocial perspective taking associated with enhanced mental health. Thirteen percent of the survey sample (n = 330) endorsed at least one harm from psychedelic use, and these participants reported less mental health benefit. Results from the current study add to a growing database indicating that psychedelic use-even outside the context of clinical trials-may provide a wide range of mental health benefits, while also posing some risk for harm in a minority of individuals."

Aims Previous studies have shown increased sexual risk-taking in experienced MDMA/ecstasy users. The main objectives of this study were to compare levels of sexual risk-taking between a young student sample of predominantly heterosexual MDMA users and alcohol-drinker controls and investigate potential gender differences. Methods Recreational drug use and sexual risk questionnaires were completed by 20 MDMA users (10 females, 10 males) and 20 non-user controls (10 females, 10 males). They were predominantly university students, aged between 20-22 years, mainly heterosexual (n = 37), with three bisexual participants. Results MDMA users displayed significantly greater levels of sexual risk-taking than the alcohol-drinker controls. It involved significantly higher rates of casual sex, non-condom use during sex, and penetrative sexual risks. This increase in sexual riskiness occurred to a similar extent in males and females. Conclusions These findings indicate that both female and male ecstasy/MDMA users reported more risky sexual behaviours, than the non-user controls. Further research into the sexual behaviour and sexual risk-taking of heterosexual MDMA users should be conducted because much of the past literature has focused on homosexual participants."
"1166","1","Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults.^
BACKGROUND: Considering the ample evidence of involvement of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of depression, pre-clinical and clinical studies have been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate inhibition, and glutamate receptor modulators in particular. This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.All included studies administered ketamine intravenously, which can pose practical problems in clinical practice. Very few trials were included in the meta-analyses for each comparison; the majority of comparisons contained only one study. Further RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine with longer follow-up, which test the comparative efficacy of ketamine and the efficacy of repeated administrations."
"2143","1","Pharmacology of ayahuasca administered in two repeated doses.^
RATIONALE: Ayahuasca is an Amazonian tea containing the natural psychedelic 5-HT(2A/2C/1A) agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is used in ceremonial contexts for its visionary properties. The human pharmacology of ayahuasca has been well characterized following its administration in single doses. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the human pharmacology of ayahuasca in repeated doses and assess the potential occurrence of acute tolerance or sensitization. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial, nine experienced psychedelic drug users received PO the two following treatment combinations at least 1 week apart: (a) a lactose placebo and then, 4 h later, an ayahuasca dose; and (b) two ayahuasca doses 4 h apart. All ayahuasca doses were freeze-dried Amazonian-sourced tea encapsulated to a standardized 0.75 mg DMT/kg bodyweight. Subjective, neurophysiological, cardiovascular, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and cell immunity measures were obtained before and at regular time intervals until 12 h after first dose administration. RESULTS: DMT plasma concentrations, scores in subjective and neurophysiological variables, and serum prolactin and cortisol were significantly higher after two consecutive doses. When effects were standardized by plasma DMT concentrations, no differences were observed for subjective, neurophysiological, autonomic, or immunological effects. However, we observed a trend to reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and a significant decrease for growth hormone (GH) after the second ayahuasca dose. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas there was no clear-cut tolerance or sensitization in the psychological sphere or most physiological variables, a trend to lower cardiovascular activation was observed, together with significant tolerance to GH secretion."

Results: Ninety-nine participants completed the survey (52% female, mean age 42 years). The majority (72%) supported further research, with 59% supporting psilocybin as a medical treatment. A total of 27% previously used recreational psilocybin, with a male preponderance (p = 0.01). Younger age groups, those with previous psychedelic experience, and those with non-religious beliefs were more likely to have favourable attitudes towards psilocybin. A total of 55% of the total sample would accept as a treatment if doctor recommended, whereas 20% would not. Fewer people with depression/anxiety had used recreational psychedelics (p = 0.03) but were more likely to support government funded studies (p = 0.02). A minority (5%) of people with conditions (psychosis and bipolar disorder) that could be exacerbated by psilocybin thought it would be useful for them. One fifth of the total sample viewed psychedelics as addictive and unsafe even under medical supervision. Concerns included fear of adverse effects, lack of knowledge, insufficient research, illegality, and relapse if medications were discontinued. Conclusions: The majority supported further research into psilocybin therapy. Younger people, those with previous recreational psychedelic experience, and those with non-religious beliefs were more likely to have favourable attitudes towards psilocybin therapy."
"9038","1","Visuo-spatial working memory deficits in current and former users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^
Verbal working memory and executive deficits have been observed in ecstasy users. The present study sought to establish whether these also extended to visuo-spatial working memory. Thirty-six current ecstasy users, 12 former users (abstinent for at least 6 months) and 31 individuals that had never used ecstasy were tested on a maintenance plus type visuo-spatial working memory task. The task required participants to recall a sequence of specially marked cells in a four-by-four matrix display while at the same time performing a concurrent visual judgement task. Both the current and former user groups registered impairments relative to nonusers. These remained significant following statistical controls for a range of potentially confounding variables including the use of various other drugs during the 3 months prior to testing. Users were unimpaired on a simple spatial span measure suggesting that the deficits observed reflected the executive aspects of the spatial working memory task. Also consistent with executive involvement, statistical controls for measures of verbal working memory performance (computation span) removed half of the ecstasy-related variance in spatial working memory. The possibility that the pattern of results obtained might reflect some general impairment in information processing efficiency is discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"9175","1","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Further study and optimization of this treatment approach in well-powered clinical trials is recommended."
"2182","0","Recreational drug use: a major risk factor for gastroschisis?.^
The authors tested the hypothesis that the birth prevalence of gastroschisis is positively associated with use of recreational drugs in early pregnancy. A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003. For each case, three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery, region, and maternal age. Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios. Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis. Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1) any recreational drug (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 4.3) and 2) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs (defined as cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy) (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.5). Other significant exposures included aspirin use (OR = 20.4, 95% CI: 2.2, 191.5), cigarette smoking (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6), and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.6). Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking, aspirin use, and history of gynecologic infection/disease. Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use."

"6040","1","Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in 12 Subjects With PTSD.^
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that can develop after people experience a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but these treatments do not help everyone. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD. This is a Phase 2 randomized, dose comparison, double‐blind study to assess safety and efficacy of manualized MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in treating chronic, treatment‐resistant PTSD. Seven subjects will be randomized to receive full dose MDMA (full dose condition) and five subjects will receive a comparator (comparator condition), with an optional supplemental half‐dose available 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Global Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score one month after two sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is the primary outcome measure. MDMA or comparator will be administered in two blinded experimental sessions lasting up to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart. The will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months of psychotherapy, and a long‐term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final experimental session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to assess eligibility for enrollment. Once in the study, they will see the same male and female psychotherapist for the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the investigators will learn more about the subject during three preparatory sessions occurring before the first experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will receive an initial dose of either full dose MDMA or placebo along with psychotherapy, and one and a half to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a supplemental half the size of the initial dose. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. There will be three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, including one occurring the day after an experimental session. Subjects will express, understand and connect any of their thoughts or feelings about PTSD symptoms and their causes, and they will discuss their experience during experimental sessions with the therapists. Subjects will learn the dose of MDMA they received one month after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session. Subjects who received full dose will complete Stage 1, with a third open‐label session, and subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will go on to Stage 2, an open label period of the study that is nearly identical to stage 1, but with one instead of three preparatory sessions and one of two active doses of MDMA used in all three experimental sessions. This study will compare the effects of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus full dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, dissociation, general psychological well‐being, sleep quality and potential positive effects of experiencing traumatic events will be measured in all subjects at baseline, one month after the second experimental session and 12 months after their final experimental session, and any subjects reporting pain or tinnitus at the start of the study will record these symptoms throughout the study.Subjects who received the full dose and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of PTSD and other symptoms two months after the third experimental session. Subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session and two months after the third experimental session. Measures of cognitive function will be given to subjects in Stage two months after their third experimental session, and to Stage 2 subjects two months after their third Stage 2 session. People will also complete measures of their experience of the experimental session soon after each experimental session. At least 12 months after their final Stage 1 or Stage 2 session, measures of PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, sleep quality, general well‐being and and post traumatic growth will be assessed again, and subjects will complete a questionnaire on the benefits and harms of study participation and other life events and views related to study participation."
"1648","0","Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels and cocaine-induced transient psychotic symptoms.^
Background: Cocaine-induced psychosis (CIP) is among the most serious adverse effects of cocaine. Reduced serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels have been reported in schizophrenia and psychosis; however, studies assessing the involvement of BDNF in CIP are lacking. Methods: A total of 22 cocaine-dependent patients (aged 33.65 ± 6.85) who had never experienced psychotic symptoms under the influence of cocaine (non-CIP) and 18 patients (aged 34.18 ± 8.54) with a history of CIP completed a 2-week detoxification program in an inpatient facility. Two serum samples were collected from each patient at baseline and at the end of the protocol. Demographic, consumption and clinical data were recorded for all patients. A paired group of healthy controls was also included. Results: At the beginning of the detoxification treatment, serum BDNF levels were similar in both the non-CIP and the CIP groups. During early abstinence, the non-CIP group exhibited a significant increase in serum BDNF levels (p = 0.030), whereas the CIP group exhibited a decrease. Improvements in depression (Beck Depression Inventory, BDI, p = 0.003) and withdrawal symptoms (Cocaine Selective Severity Assessment, CSSA, p = 0.013) show a significant positive correlation with serum BDNF levels in the non-CIP group, whereas no correlation between the same variables was found in the CIP group. Conclusions: This study suggests that BDNF plays a role in the transient psychotic symptoms associated with cocaine consumption. In the non-CIP group, the increase in serum BDNF appears to be driven by the effects of chronic cocaine consumption and withdrawal. In contrast, patients with CIP share some of the neurotrophic deficiencies that characterize schizophrenia and psychosis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"1634","1","Near-death states reported in a sample of 50 misusers.^
Increase in recreational ketamine use may be a cause for concern. We aimed here at assessing, in a sample of ketamine misusers, concordance between the typical near-death experience (NDE) features and the on-drug psychoactive effects the subjects experienced. In 2003-2005, a sample of previous ketamine misusers recollecting a ketamine-related NDE were recruited through snowballing and screened with the means of the Greyson NDE Scale; 125 participants made an initial contact with the researcher and 50 reported a minimum score of seven at the ""Greyson NDE Scale"". Interviewees were in the range 21-66 years old; 27 participants (54%) were educated at BA level, 18 (36%) had an MSc, and 5 (10%) a PhD. Eight (16%) interviewees had a definite religious background. An average lifetime ketamine intake of 140 occasions was reported by the interviewees, who typically presented with a polydrug, including cannabis and MDMA/ecstasy, misuse history. In 45 (90%) cases, the NDE occurred during the first few occasions of intake. Most frequent features of reported NDE states included: altered perception of time (90%), strong sense of detaching from own physical body (88%), and a sense of peace/joy (76% of subjects). Although results here described were elicited from a self-selected, nonrandomized, limited size sample of misusers, we suggest that recreational ketamine intake may be associated with occurrence of near-death related states."
"6710","0","MDMA and temperature: a review of the thermal effects of 'Ecstasy' in humans.^
AIMS: To review the thermal effects of MDMA in humans, and discuss the practical implications. METHODS: The literature on Ecstasy/MDMA, body temperature, and subjective thermal self-ratings was reviewed, and explanatory models for the changes in thermal homeostasis were examined and debated. RESULTS: In human placebo-controlled laboratory studies, the effects of MDMA were dose related. Low doses had little effect, moderate doses increased body temperature by around +0.4°C, and higher doses caused a mean increase of +0.7°C. With Ecstasy/MDMA using dance clubbers, the findings showed greater variation, due possibly to uncontrolled factors such as physical activity, ambient temperature, and overcrowding. Some real world studies found average body temperature increases of over +1.0°C. Thermal homeostasis involves a balance between heat production and heat dissipation, and MDMA affects both aspects of this homeostatic equation. Cellular metabolic heat output is increased, and heat dissipation mechanisms are stressed, with the onset of sweating delayed. Subjective responses of 'feeling hot' or 'hot-cold flushes' are frequent, but can show individual variation. Some recreational users report that heat increases or reinstates the positive mood effects of Ecstasy/MDMA. The dangers of acute hyperthermia can include rare fatalities. It is unclear why moderate hyperthermia can occasionally progress to severe hyperpyrexia, although it may reflect a combination or cascade of events. In chronic terms, the bioenergetic stress model notes that the adverse psychobiological effects of MDMA are heightened by various co-stimulatory factors, including heat stress. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA increases core body temperature and thermal stress in humans."
"892","1","Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^
In reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

"1644","0","From drugs to deprivation: a Bayesian framework for understanding models of psychosis.^
INTRODUCTION: Various experimental manipulations, usually involving drug administration, have been used to produce symptoms of psychosis in healthy volunteers. Different drugs produce both common and distinct symptoms. A challenge is to understand how apparently different manipulations can produce overlapping symptoms. We suggest that current Bayesian formulations of information processing in the brain provide a framework that maps onto neural circuitry and gives us a context within which we can relate the symptoms of psychosis to their underlying causes. This helps us to understand the similarities and differences across the common models of psychosis. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The Bayesian approach emphasises processing of information in terms of both prior expectancies and current inputs. A mismatch between these leads us to update inferences about the world and to generate new predictions for the future. According to this model, what we experience shapes what we learn, and what we learn modifies how we experience things. DISCUSSION: This simple idea gives us a powerful and flexible way of understanding the symptoms of psychosis where perception, learning and inference are deranged. We examine the predictions of the cognitive model in light of what we understand about the neuropharmacology of psychotomimetic drugs and thereby attempt to account for the common and the distinctive effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, serotonergic hallucinogens, cannabinoids and dopamine agonists. CONCLUSION: By acknowledging the importance of perception and perceptual aberration in mediating the positive symptoms of psychosis, the model also provides a useful setting in which to consider an under-researched model of psychosis-sensory deprivation."

OBJECTIVE: The comorbidity of psychiatric disorders and substance abuse disorders among adolescents and adults is well-documented in the literature. The current study investigates the relationship between psychiatric and substance use disorders in a sample of treatment-seeking Hispanic adolescents. METHODS: The study uses baseline data (N = 190) from a randomized control trial testing the effectiveness of a family-based treatment for Hispanic adolescents with substance abuse disorder to examine the relationship between psychiatric disorders and substance use patterns at baseline, including types of substances used (both lifetime use and past-month use) and age at onset of substance use, controlling for age and gender. RESULTS: Linear regression models were used to examine predictors of age at onset, while logistic regression models examined predictors of lifetime substance use. Significant findings predicting age at onset for marijuana and alcohol are discussed. In addition, psychiatric profiles were differentially associated with lifetime use of sedatives, stimulants, and hallucinogens, but not alcohol or marijuana. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this study can be used to help inform the treatment of adolescents seeking mental health and substance use services."
"2548","0","Breakthrough for Trauma Treatment: Safety and Efficacy of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy Compared to Paroxetine and Sertraline.^
Unsuccessfully treated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and life-threatening disorder. Two medications, paroxetine hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride, are approved treatments for PTSD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Analyses of pharmacotherapies for PTSD found only small to moderate effects when compared with placebo. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the FDA for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD on the basis of pooled analyses showing a large effect size for this treatment. This review covers data supporting BTD. In this treatment, MDMA is administered with psychotherapy in up to three monthly 8-h sessions. Participants are prepared for these sessions beforehand, and process material arising from the sessions in follow-up integrative psychotherapy sessions. Comparing data used for the approval of paroxetine and sertraline and pooled data from Phase 2 studies, MAPS demonstrated that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy constitutes a substantial improvement over available pharmacotherapies in terms of safety and efficacy. Studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy had lower dropout rates compared to sertraline and paroxetine trials. As MDMA is only administered under direct observation during a limited number of sessions, there is little chance of diversion, accidental or intentional overdose, or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. BTD status has expedited the development of MAPS phase 3 trials occurring worldwide, leading up to a planned submission seeking FDA approval in 2021.

Background: The use of central stimulant drugs causes significant morbidity. We describe poisonings with central stimulant drugs and compare the different central stimulants concerning combinations with other drugs, treatment, and clinical course. Methods: Patients presenting from 1 October 2013 to 31 March 2016 with poisoning related to the recreational use of central stimulant drugs were retrospectively included at a primary care emergency outpatient clinic and at a hospital emergency department in Oslo, Norway. Diagnosis of toxic agents was mainly based on the clinical assessment of the doctor treating the patient. Amphetamine and methamphetamine were co-categorized as amphetamine. Results: Among the 1131 cases of acute poisoning with central stimulant drugs at the outpatient clinic, amphetamine was involved in 808 (71.4%), cocaine in 252 (22.3%) methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in 104 (9.2%), and methylphenidate in 13 (1.1%). Among the 211 cases at the hospital, amphetamine was involved in 167 (79.1%), cocaine in 60 (28.4%), and MDMA in 38 (18.0%). Amphetamine was frequently combined with opioids (40.1% at the outpatient clinic and 41.9% at the hospital) and benzodiazepines (28.3% and 45.5%), while MDMA often was combined with ethanol (64.4% and 71.1%), as was cocaine (62.7% and 61.7%). Sedation was given in 5.2% and 38.4% of cases, naloxone in 9.4% and 37.0%, and flumazenil in 0.1% and 28.0%. In total, 16.5% of the cases at the outpatient clinic were transferred to a hospital for medical review and 8.5% to a psychiatric hospital. Among the hospital patients, 92.9% were admitted to intensive care. Conclusion: Amphetamine was the most common central stimulant drug involved in acute poisoning in Oslo, often combined with opioids and benzodiazepines."
"644","1","Qualitative and Quantitative Features of Music Reported to Support Peak Mystical Experiences during Psychedelic Therapy Sessions.^
Psilocybin is a classic (serotonergic) hallucinogen (""psychedelic"" drug) that may occasion mystical experiences (characterized by a profound feeling of oneness or unity) during acute effects. Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience. Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterized by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences. This description can be used to guide the selection and composition of music for future psychedelic research and therapy sessions."
"2290","0","The potential of (1)H-MRS in CNS drug development.^
RATIONALE: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is a cross-species neuroimaging technique that can measure concentrations of several brain metabolites, including glutamate and GABA. This non-invasive method has promise in developing centrally acting drugs, as it can be performed repeatedly within-subjects and be used to translate findings from the preclinical to clinical laboratory using the same imaging biomarker. OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on the utility of single-voxel (1)H-MRS in developing novel glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and includes research performed in rodent models, healthy volunteers and patient cohorts. RESULTS: Overall, these studies indicate that (1)H-MRS is able to detect the predicted pharmacological effects of glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs on voxel glutamate or GABA concentrations, although there is a shortage of studies examining dose-related effects. Clinical studies have applied (1)H-MRS to better understand drug therapeutic mechanisms, including the glutamatergic effects of ketamine in depression and of acamprosate in alcohol dependence. There is an emerging interest in identifying patient subgroups with 'high' or 'low' brain regional (1)H-MRS glutamate levels for more targeted drug development, which may require ancillary biomarkers to improve the accuracy of subgroup discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations for future research include the sensitivity of single-voxel (1)H-MRS in detecting drug effects, inter-site measurement reliability and the interpretation of drug-induced changes in (1)H-MRS metabolites relative to the known pharmacological molecular mechanisms. On-going technological development, in single-voxel (1)H-MRS and in related complementary techniques, will further support applications within CNS drug discovery."
"9053","1","Modulation of the cortical processing of novel and target stimuli by drugs affecting glutamate and GABA neurotransmission.^
In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we examined the effects of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine (an NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist) and thiopental (a GABA-A receptor agonist) on the event-related potential (ERP) correlates of deviant stimulus processing in 24 healthy adults. Participants completed three separate pharmacological challenge sessions (ketamine, thiopental, saline) in a counterbalanced order. EEG data were recorded both before and during each challenge while participants performed a visual 'oddball' task consisting of infrequent 'target' and 'novel' stimuli intermixed with frequent 'standard' stimuli. We examined drug effects on the amplitude and latency of the P300 (P3) component of the ERP elicited by target (P3b) and novel stimuli (P3a), as well as the N200 (N2) component elicited by both target and novel stimuli, and the N100 (N1) elicited by standard stimuli. Relative to placebo, both drugs reduced the amplitude of parietal P3b. While both drugs reduced parietal P3a and Novelty N2, ketamine also shortened P3a latency, reduced Novelty N2 amplitude more than thiopental, and increased frontal P3a amplitude relative to placebo. Overall, the data suggest that both the GABA-A and NMDA receptor systems modulate P3b and P3a. NMDA antagonism appears to lead to more varied effects on the neural correlates of novelty processing.

"8971","1","Use of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide by Major Depression Status.^
Importance: Renewed interest in the clinical potential of hallucinogens may lead people with depression to a generally more positive view of the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Therefore, past-year LSD use among people with depression may be increasing in prevalence. Objective: To assess time trends in the prevalence of past-year nonmedical LSD use by past-year major depression status and the variation in this association by sociodemographic characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used pooled publicly available data from 478 492 adults aged 18 years or older who were administered the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 through 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 2022 to June 2023. Main Outcome and Measures: Past-year major depression diagnoses per criteria from the DSM-IV were analyzed. Logistic regression models examined whether time trends in past-year nonmedical LSD use differed between adults with vs without past-year depression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Secondary analyses examined whether the trends in LSD use by depression status differed between sociodemographic subgroups. Results: The analytic sample included 478 492 adults, of whom 51.8% were female, 56.1% were younger than 50 years, 11.7% were Black, 15.1% were Hispanic, 65.8% were White, and 7.5% were another race. Weighted interview response rates ranged from 64.9% to 75.6% during the study time frame. From 2008 to 2019, past-year use of LSD increased significantly more among adults with major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.5%; 2019 prevalence, 1.8%; prevalence difference [PD], 1.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%]) compared with adults without major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.2%; 2019 prevalence, 0.8%; PD, 0.6% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.7%]) (difference in difference, 0.8% [95% CI, 0.5%-1.1%]). This difference was particularly pronounced among young adults aged 34 years or younger (PD among those aged 18-25 years with depression, 3.3% [95% CI, 2.5%-4.2%]; PD among those aged 26-34 years with depression, 2.7% [95% CI, 1.6%-3.8%]) and individuals with incomes less than $75 000 per year (PD among those with income <$20 000, 1.9% [95% CI, 1.3%-2.6%]; PD among those with income $20 000-$49 999, 1.5% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.1%]; PD among those with income $50 000-$74 999, 1.3% [95% CI, 0.7%-2.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, from 2008 to 2019, there was a disproportionate increase in the prevalence of past-year LSD use among US adults with past-year depression. Among those with depression, this increase was particularly strong among younger adults and those with lower household incomes. Among individuals with depression who also report LSD use, clinicians should discuss potential strategies for mitigating harm and maximizing benefits in medically unsupervised settings."
"3781","1","α₁-Adrenergic receptors contribute to the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in humans.^
Preclinical studies implicate a role for α₁-noradrenergic receptors in the effects of psychostimulants, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). The present study evaluated the effects of the α₁-noradrenergic receptor antagonist doxazosin on the acute pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic response to MDMA in 16 healthy subjects. Doxazosin (8 mg/d) or placebo was administered for 3 days before MDMA (125 mg) or placebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-session, crossover design. Doxazosin reduced MDMA-induced elevations in blood pressure, body temperature, and moderately attenuated positive mood but enhanced tachycardia associated with MDMA. The results indicate that α₁-adrenergic receptors contribute to the acute cardiostimulant and to a minor extent possibly also to the thermogenic and euphoric effects of MDMA in humans."
"9042","0","Methylone, a rapid acting entactogen with robust anxiolytic and antidepressant-like activity.^
INTRODUCTION: Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants represent first-line pharmacological treatment for a variety of neuropsychiatric illnesses, including major depressive disorder (MDD), anxiety, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), which show high rates of comorbidity. SSRIs have a delayed onset of action. Most patients do not show significant effects until 4-8 weeks of continuous treatment, have impairing side effects and as many as 40% of patients do not respond. Methylone (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylcathinone; MDMC, βk-MDMA, M1) is a rapid-acting entactogen that showed significant benefit in a clinical case series of PTSD patients and was well-tolerated in two Phase 1 studies of healthy volunteers. Based on these early observations in humans, in the current study we tested the hypothesis that methylone has antidepressant-like and anxiolytic effects in preclinical tests. METHODS: For all studies, 6-8-week-old male Sprague Dawley rats (N = 6-16) were used. We employed the Forced Swim Test (FST), a classic and widely used screen for antidepressants, to explore the effects of methylone and to probe dose-response relationships, durability of effect, and potential interactions with combined SSRI treatment. We compared the effect of methylone with the prototypical SSRI fluoxetine. RESULTS: Three doses of fluoxetine (10 mg/kg) given within 24 h before FST testing caused a 50% reduction in immobility compared with controls that lasted less than 24 h. In contrast, a single dose of methylone (5-30 mg/kg) administered 30 min prior to testing produced a rapid, robust, and durable antidepressant-like response in the FST, greater in magnitude than fluoxetine. Immobility was reduced by nearly 95% vs. controls and effects persisted for at least 72 h after a single dose (15 mg/kg). Effects on swimming and climbing behavior in the FST, which reflect serotonergic and noradrenergic activity, respectively, were consistent with studies showing that methylone is less serotoninergic than MDMA. Fluoxetine pretreatment did not change methylone's antidepressant-like effect in the FST, suggesting the possibility that the two may be co-administered. In addition, methylone (5-30 mg/kg) exhibited anxiolytic effects measured as increased time spent in the center of an open field. DISCUSSION: Taken together, and consistent with initial clinical findings, our study suggests that methylone may have potential for treating depression and anxiety."
"5338","0","Study of the psychotropic drug oxypertine in anxiety states.^
Oxypertine, a new anxiolytic drug related to the indolylazine compounds, was evaluated in 20 patients with acute or chronic anxiety. Each case was scored 4 times with the Hamilton Rating Scale during 4 wk of treatment. The initial dose in all cases was a 10 mg oxypertine capsule t.i.d. From the 20 cases, 19 completed the treatment as planned, showing the following results: 13 excellent (68%), 3 good (16%), 2 fair (11%) and 1 poor (5%). Depression was associated in 13 of the cases and was also modified satisfactorily with the treatment. One patient was eliminated due to reconsideration of the initial diagnosis, and classified as psychotic (schizophrenia). Since in this type of investigation drowsiness as a reaction is usually evaluated, it was observed severe in one case (disappeared when dosage was reduced to 20 mg) and mild in 3 (in one patient disappeared reducing dosage to 20 mg). The conclusion of the study was that oxypertine is a useful drug in the management of all types of anxiety states, including those where depression is present."
"4848","1","Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^
An unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period. This study suggests that high potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be more effective than low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD."

Examination of the correlates of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use is crucial for the development and implementation of effective prevention programs for adolescents. The aim of the present study was therefore to identify the family, peer and individual factors that were related to MDMA use in Taiwanese adolescents. Two hundred adolescents who used MDMA and 200 who did not use MDMA were recruited into the study. The family, peer and individual factors related to MDMA use were examined using χ2 automatic interaction detection (CHAID) analysis. The results indicated that the adolescents who had more friends involved with substance use, disruptive family and attitude favoring MDMA use were more likely to use MDMA. Multiple factors of family, peer and individuals were related to MDMA use among Taiwanese adolescents. This knowledge may be helpful when designing and implementing preventive intervention programs. © 2007 The Authors."
"4313","0","Prenatal methamphetamine exposure and neonatal and infant neurobehavioral outcome: results from the IDEAL study.^
BACKGROUND: Methamphetamine (MA) use among pregnant women is an increasing problem in the United States. How MA use during pregnancy affects neonatal and infant neurobehavior is unknown. METHODS: The Infant Development, Environment, and Lifestyle (IDEAL) study screened 34,833 subjects at 4 clinical centers. Of the subjects, 17,961 were eligible and 3705 were consented, among which 412 were enrolled for longitudinal follow-up. Exposed subjects were identified by self-report and/or gas chromatography/mass spectroscopy (GC/MS) confirmation of amphetamine and metabolites in meconium. Comparison subjects were matched (race, birth weight, maternal education, insurance), denied amphetamine use, and had a negative meconium screen. Both groups included prenatal alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana use, but excluded use of opiates, lysergic acid diethylamide, or phencyclidine. The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS) was administered within the first 5 days of life and again at 1 month to 380 enrollees (185 exposed, 195 comparison). Analysis of variance (ANOVA) tested exposure effects on NNNS summary scores at birth and 1 month. General linear model (GLM) repeated-measures analysis assessed the effect of MA exposure over time on the NNNS scores with and without covariates. RESULTS: By 1 month of age, both groups demonstrated higher quality of movement (P = .029), less lethargy (P = .001), and fewer asymmetric reflexes (P = .012), with no significant differences in NNNS scores between the exposed and comparison groups. Over the first month of life, arousal increased in exposed infants but decreased in comparison infants (P = .031) and total stress was decreased in exposed infants, with no change in comparison infants (P = .026). CONCLUSIONS: Improvement in total stress and arousal were observed in MA-exposed newborns by 1 month of age relative to the newborn period."
"6563","1","The relation between naturalistic use of psychedelics and perception of emotional stimuli: An event-related potential study comparing non-users and experienced users of classic psychedelics.^
Background: Previous research has suggested that controlled administration of psychedelic substances can modulate emotional reactivity, enhancing positive and diminishing negative emotions. However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300). Conclusions: The results suggest that naturalistic use of psychedelics may be linked to reduced reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli at the early and automatic processing stages. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the effects related to using psychedelics in naturalistic contexts."
"7588","1","Toward a typology of hallucinogen users in the United States.^
Background: Roughly one in ten American adults have used hallucinogens, and emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of use is increasing. However, our understanding of the degree to which individuals “specialize” in the use of a particular hallucinogen or are poly-hallucinogen users remains incomplete. Methods: This study examined data from 6381 individuals reporting past-year hallucinogen use in the 2016–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression examined the association between the number of distinct hallucinogens used and psychosocial/behavioral risks, and latent class analysis (LCA) characterized subgroups of hallucinogen users. Results: The vast majority of hallucinogen users, roughly 70%, are not “specialists” who use only one hallucinogen type; rather, lifetime poly-hallucinogen use is the norm. Critically, however, we also see that important differences exist within the population of hallucinogen users—half (51%) could be classified as LSD-Mushroom-Ecstasy users only (this group was disproportionally comprised of youth), nearly one third (30%) were Poly-Hallucinogen users (this group was disproportionately male and non-Hispanic White), and smaller proportions were limited primarily to use of LSD-Mushrooms (6%; these individuals were almost exclusively ages 35 and older) or Ecstasy Only (12%; these individuals were mostly younger adults ages 18–34). Conclusions: Findings provide a fresh contribution to our understanding of poly-hallucinogen use in a time in which local and state governmental leaders, and people across the country, weigh the benefits and drawbacks of legalizing specific hallucinogenic drugs."
"4574","1","Dissociation of ketamine effects on rule acquisition and rule implementation: possible relevance to NMDA receptor contributions to executive cognitive functions.^
BACKGROUND: The demands of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) change with experience. This report contains two studies designed to examine N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor contributions to the executive components of WCST performance. These aspects of WCST performance figure more prominently in the initial completion of this task than in subsequent task repetitions in healthy populations. METHODS: In the first study, healthy subjects (n = 15) completed the WCST on two occasions separated by 1 week. In the second study, healthy subjects (n = 22) completed two test days spaced by approximately 1 week, during which, they completed the WCST and other assessments after administration of the NMDA antagonist ketamine (intravenous bolus 0.26 mg/kg followed by infusion of 0.65 mg/kg/hour) or matched placebo. RESULTS: In the first study, subjects reduced the number of total and perseverative errors with a single repetition of the WCST. In the second study, ketamine significantly increased the number of total errors and the number and percent of perseverative errors on the first, but not the second test day. Similarly, it reduced the number of category criteria met on the first, but not second test day. Ketamine also increased distractibility, impaired recall, produced psychosis, altered perception, and had effects resembling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, only WCST performance showed order dependency. CONCLUSIONS: This order dependency further implicates NMDA receptors in executive cognitive functions associated with the frontal cortex."
"6584","1","Intravenous Ketamine for Late-Life Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Pilot Study of Tolerability, Safety, Clinical Benefits, and Effect on Cognition.^
OBJECTIVE: Evidence-based treatment options for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are limited. Ketamine is a promising treatment for TRD; however, there is a paucity of data on its safety and efficacy in older adults. METHODS: In this pilot clinical trial, 25 adults aged ≥60 years with TRD received IV ketamine openly twice a week for 4 weeks; partial responders at the end of this acute phase were eligible to receive weekly infusions for 4 more weeks in a continuation phase. Acceptability, tolerability, and safety, including adverse and serious adverse events (AEs and SAEs), blood pressure changes, dissociation, craving, in addition to rates of depression response and remission were evaluated. The NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery was used to assess specific measures of executive function (EF) and overall fluid cognition. RESULTS: Completion rates were 88% for the acute phase and 100% for the continuation phase. No AEs resulted in participant discontinuation, and there were no SAEs. Treatment-emergent elevation of blood pressure, dissociation, and craving were transient and did not result in any participant discontinuation. Depressive symptoms improved significantly and 48% of participants responded. During the acute phase, the EF measures and the fluid cognition composite score improved (Cohen's d = 0.61), and these improvements were sustained in the continuation phase. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that repeated IV ketamine infusions are well-tolerated and are associated with improvement in depression and EF in older adults with TRD. These promising findings need to be confirmed and extended in a larger randomized controlled trial."
"1703","1","Neurocognitive impact of ketamine treatment in major depressive disorder: A review on human and animal studies.^
BACKGROUND: Most recent evidence support a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, clinical and animal studies investigating the effects of intravenous ketamine on specific functional domains disrupted by depression reported conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent findings exploring the cognitive effects of ketamine in depression. METHODS: After a bibliographic search on PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo, we retrieved 11 original studies meeting our research criteria, 7 in humans with MDD or Treatment Resistant Disorder and 4 using rats models for depression. RESULTS: Overall the results showed that a) ketamine reduced activation and normalized connectivity measures of several brain regions related to depressive behaviors and reversed deficits in cognitive flexibility and coping response strategy in rats with depressive features, and b) ketamine leads to a no significant impairment on neurocognitive functions in most of the studies, with only three studies observing improvements in speed of processing, verbal learning, sustained attention and response control, verbal and working memory. LIMITATIONS: The methodological heterogeneity, in terms of neuropsychological tests used and cognitive domain explored, of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies included showed no significant cognitive impairments in MDD patients after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, the results of the fMRI studies considered suggest that ketamine may have a normalizing effect on brain functions during attentional and emotional processing in MDD patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary evidences."

"3698","1","Psychotherapy with Psilocybin for Depression: Systematic Review.^
Depression is a common mental health issue that affects 280 million people in the world with a high mortality rate, as well as being a leading cause of disability. Psychopharmacological therapies with psychedelics, particularly those with psilocybin, are showing promising potential for the treatment of depression, among other conditions. Some of their benefits include a rapid and exponential improvement in depressive symptoms and an increased sense of well-being that can last for months after the treatment, as well as a greater development of introspective capacity. The aim of this project was to provide experimental evidence about therapeutic procedures along with psilocybin for the treatment of major depressive disorder. The project highlights eight studies that examined this condition. Some of them dealt with treatment-resistant depression while others dealt with depression due to a life-threatening disease such as cancer. These publications affirm the efficiency of the psilocybin therapy for depression, with only one or two doses in conjunction with psychological support during the process."

Clinical practice and data from literature indicate that up to 30% of the patients suffering from depression meet criteria for treatment-resistant depression. In the past decade, interest in the use of NMDA receptor modulators in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression is increasing. The use of ketamine--an noncompetitive antagonist of the NMDA receptors, allows some patients suffering from treatment resistant depression to achieve rapid and significant improvement. The authors reviewed results of clinical studies, series of cases and case reports on the use of ketamine. Most of the patient suffered from the treatment-resistant major depression. Neurobiological basis of the glutaminergic pathways and the postulated role of glutamate in mood modulation have been described, as well as possible adverse events associated with ketamine infusion. Concerns relate to the optimal dosage, frequency of administration, long-term safety and efficacy of the therapy. Interesting results of the published articles encourage further studies on therapeutic use of NMDA receptor modulators in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression."

Two ultralight general anesthetic techniques, one using low-dose ketamine and the other using methohexital as the primary anesthetic agent, were compared for efficacy, safety, and psychomotor recovery in a double-blind fashion for use during third molar surgery. Low-dose intravenous ketamine as the primary anesthetic following premedication with fentanyl and midazolam, and in conjunction with nitrous oxide, appeared to produce less hypoxia, hypercarbia, and apnea than when methohexital was used. No significant differences were noted in heart rate or blood pressure between the techniques. The ketamine technique was universally preferred by the surgeons and anesthesiologists because of superior patient cooperation and airway management. No unpleasant psychomimetic side effects of significance were noted with the use of ketamine. Postoperative recovery took slightly longer in the ketamine group, with patients being judged fit for discharge approximately 10 to 15 minutes later than the patients who received methohexital."

"2556","1","Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^
BACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population."
"7062","1","The effect of 5-HT2A/1A agonist treatment on social cognition, empathy, and social decision making.^
Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5HT‐1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5HT‐1A/2A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. In a double‐blind, randomized, cross‐over design we therefore investigated the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in healthy volunteers using fMRI. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. The neural response to social exclusion in the ACC ‐ a brain region associated with 'social pain'‐ was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo. Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin while no significant differences were found in cognitive empathy. These results show that the 5HT‐1A/2A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio‐cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients."

This pilot study explored the feasibility of using ketamine to increase hypnotizability scores. Ketamine, classified as a dissociative hallucinogen, is used clinically as an anesthetic in high doses and as a treatment for chronic pain and depression in lower doses. Low-dose ketamine can contribute to dissociation and heightened perceptions and feelings of detachment, arguably hypnotic-like states. The authors predicted that a low dose of ketamine in healthy volunteers who scored in the low hypnotizable range on the Stanford Clinical Hypnotizability Scale would (a) cause an increase in subjective ratings of dissociation and (b) lead to an increase in hypnotizability. The findings were in the predicted direction, warranting further investigation into the use of this agent to increase hypnotizability."

Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder with major implications for healthcare system and socioeconomic burden. For chronic and treatment-resistant depression, Ketamine has emerged as a possible treatment option. This systematic review explores the evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of Ketamine in patients with MDD. This systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Eight electronic databases were searched by using search terms: (ketamine) AND (trial OR RCT OR clinical-trial) AND (depressive OR depression OR ""depressive-disorder""). After a rigorous screening process against the predetermined eligibility criteria, 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Quality assessment of included studies was done by using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. Thirty-five RCTs are included in this review article with majority of studies from United States, Iran, and China. Intravenous (IV) Ketamine was effective in 70% (21/30) of the included studies whereas oral and Intranasal (IN) Ketamine were effective in two and three studies, respectively. The majority of studies (6/8) using Ketamine as anesthetic agent during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) failed to show an improvement compared to the participants receiving ECT and placebo. The most common reported side effects were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diplopia, drowsiness, dysphoria, hallucinations, and confusion. Ketamine is an effective treatment option for patients with MDD with undesirable effects when administered via oral, IV and IN routes. Ketamine agumentation of ECT requires further exploration in well-designed studies with adequate sample size. The short-lived antidepressant effect of Ketamine is a potential limitation, therefore, further studies administering multiple infusions for acute treatment and maintenance are necessary."

"3757","1","A proof-of concept randomized controlled trial to show that the antidepressant effect of psilocybin does not require a psychedelic experience: study protocol.^
Introduction: During the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest on the use of psychedelics as novel treatments for mental disorders, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, the chemical component of magic mushrooms , has been administered with psychotherapy in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showing large and sustained antidepressant effects. As the use of psilocybin expands, it is becoming more important to understand whether psilocybin's psychedelic effects are required for psilocybin's antidepressant effects. Psilocybin's psychedelic effects are known to be dependent on serotonin 2A receptor (5‐HT2AR) activation. Given the safety concerns associated with psilocybin's psychedelic effects, all studies have used it in conjunction with at least 12 hours of intensive psychotherapy. This makes psilocybin‐assisted psychotherapy (PAP) highly resource intensive and impedes scalability given limited resources and access to trained therapists in most jurisdictions. Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are blocked by 5‐HT2AR antagonists like risperidone and ketanserin. In a preclinical study using a mouse model of depression, administration of ketanserin followed by psilocybin had the same antidepressant effect as psilocybin alone. We propose to conduct the first study to test in humans whether the antidepressant effects of psilocybin are attenuated by 5‐HT2AR blockade from risperidone. Objectives: Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of administering psilocybin with risperidone in adults with TRD by evaluating recruitment, retention, tolerability, and safety. Aim 2: To evaluate psychedelic effects (measured with the 5‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale) in the three groups. Aim 3: To evaluate antidepressant effects (measured with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS) in the three groups. . Methods: A three‐arm, 4‐week, double blind, proof‐of‐concept RCT for patients with a DSM‐5 major depressive episode that has failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressants. Participants will be randomized to: 1) psilocybin 25 mg plus risperidone 1 mg; 2) psilocybin 25 mg plus placebo; 3) placebo plus risperidone 1 mg. All participants will receive 12 hours of manualized psychotherapy. Results: Ethics approval for the proposed study has been obtained. We will present preliminary feasibility data at the meeting in March. Conclusions: If the study demonstrates that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are not necessary for psilocybin's antidepressant effects, the combination of psilocybin and a 5‐HT2AR antagonist, such as risperidone, could increase acceptability and access to the use of psilocybin to treat MDD and related conditions."

This study aims to understand the relationship between Lifetime Classic Psychedelic Use (LCPU), employment status, and weekly work hours on levels of psychological distress. The data used for this analysis is pooled from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2008–2019 and includes a sample size of 484,732 individuals. The findings suggest that LCPU and being employed are independently associated with better health. Additionally, the results indicate that psychedelic use is associated with lower distress for those who are employed, volunteer, retired, or permanently disabled. However, those who are unemployed, full-time students, or homemakers may experience higher levels of distress with psychedelic use. Interestingly, the analysis also suggests that those who use psychedelics are working longer hours per week before experiencing an increase in stress. Overall, the study suggests that psychedelics are not likely to have a negative impact on employment outcomes."

Schizophrenia is characterized by behavioral symptoms, brain function impairments and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes. Dysregulation of immune responses and oxidative imbalance underpins this mental disorder. The present study aimed to investigate the effects of the typical antipsychotic chlorpromazine (CP) alone or combined with the natural antioxidant alpha-lipoic acid (ALA) on changes in the hippocampal average spectral power induced by ketamine (KET). Three days after stereotactic implantation of electrodes, male Wistar rats were divided into groups treated for 10 days with saline (control) or KET (10 mg/kg, IP). CP (1 or 5 mg/kg, IP) alone or combined with ALA (100 mg/kg, P.O.) was administered 30 min before KET or saline. Hippocampal EEG recordings were taken on the 1st, 5th and 10th days of treatment immediately after the last drug administration. KET significantly increased average spectral power of delta and gamma-high bands on the 5th and 10th days of treatment when compared to control. Gamma low-band significantly increased on the 1st, 5th and 10th days when compared to control group. This effect of KET was prevented by CP alone or combined with ALA. Indeed, the combination of ALA 100 + CP1 potentiated the inhibitory effects of CP1 on gamma low-band oscillations. In conclusion, our results showed that KET presents excitatory and time-dependent effects on hippocampal EEG bands activity. KET excitatory effects on EEG were prevented by CP alone and in some situations potentiated by its combination with ALA. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

RESULTS: The sample was subdivided on the basis of the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale positive score following administration of THC into transiently psychotic (TP; n = 11) and non-psychotic (NP; n = 10) groups. During the THC condition, TP subjects made more frequent inhibition errors than the NP group and showed differential activation relative to the NP group in the left parahippocampal gyrus, the left and right middle temporal gyri and in the right cerebellum. In these regions, THC had opposite effects on activation relative to placebo in the two groups. The TP group also showed less activation than the NP group in the right middle temporal gyrus and cerebellum, independent of the effects of THC. CONCLUSIONS: In this first demonstration of inter-subject variability in sensitivity to the psychotogenic effects of THC, we found that the presence of acute psychotic symptoms was associated with a differential effect of THC on activation in the ventral and medial temporal cortex and cerebellum, suggesting that these regions mediate the effects of the drug on psychotic symptoms."
"6042","1","Effects of Methylphenidate, Modafinil, and MDMA on Emotion-processing in Humans: a Pharmaco-fMRI Study.^
Methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used as performance enhancers or ""smart drugs"" by students. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") is widely used as recreational drug to enhance emotions. We plan to investigate effects of these psychostimulants on emotion‐processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a placebo‐controlled, randomized cross‐over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain‐induced changes in brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs. This information will improve our understanding of the neurofunctional effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and MDMA, and inform the ongoing debate surrounding brain doping with cognitive and mood enhancers."
"7332","1","Receptor interaction profiles of novel psychoactive tryptamines compared with classic hallucinogens.^
The present study investigated interactions between the novel psychoactive tryptamines DiPT, 4-OH-DiPT, 4-OH-MET, 5-MeO-AMT, and 5-MeO-MiPT at monoamine receptors and transporters compared with the classic hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline. We investigated binding affinities at human monoamine receptors and determined functional serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine [5-HT]) 5-HT2A and 5-HT2B receptor activation. Binding at and the inhibition of human monoamine uptake transporters and transporter-mediated monoamine release were also determined. All of the novel tryptamines interacted with 5-HT2A receptors and were partial or full 5-HT2A agonists. Binding affinity to the 5-HT2A receptor was lower for all of the tryptamines, including psilocin and DMT, compared with LSD and correlated with the reported psychoactive doses in humans. Several tryptamines, including psilocin, DMT, DiPT, 4-OH-DiPT, and 4-OH-MET, interacted with the serotonin transporter and partially the norepinephrine transporter, similar to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine but in contrast to LSD and mescaline. LSD but not the tryptamines interacted with adrenergic and dopaminergic receptors. In conclusion, the receptor interaction profiles of the tryptamines predict hallucinogenic effects that are similar to classic serotonergic hallucinogens but also MDMA-like psychoactive properties."
"1507","1","MDMA-assisted therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder: A pooled analysis of ethnoracial differences in efficacy and safety from two Phase 2 open-label lead-in trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Limited ethnoracial diversity in previous ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) trials for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has prompted questions concerning whether Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) also benefit from this treatment. METHODS: Secondary analysis was conducted using a modified intent-to-treat sample pooled from two Phase 2 open-label trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial to compare efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for PTSD between BIPOC and non-Hispanic White participants. Four subgroups were of interest: MDMA-AT, BIPOC (n = 20); MDMA-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 63); Placebo-assisted therapy (Placebo-AT), BIPOC (n = 17); and Placebo-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 27). Planned comparisons tested subgroup differences in changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores from baseline to primary endpoint, controlling for study type and baseline scores. Adverse events (AEs) on the day of (day 0) to 2 days post-dosing were reported for each subgroup. RESULTS: In the MDMA-AT group, no significant ethnoracial difference in CAPS-5 change scores was observed. In the Placebo-AT group, BIPOC participants trended toward greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than non-Hispanic Whites. Among non-Hispanic Whites, MDMA-AT was accompanied by significantly greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than Placebo-AT. No treatment difference emerged among BIPOC participants. AEs were mostly rated as mild or moderate across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for treating PTSD across ethnoracial groups. There was also a trend toward greater efficacy with Placebo-AT among BIPOC participants. There was an imbalance in subgroups, highlighting the need for culturally responsive recruitment strategies to diversify future studies."

The aims of this study were to assess the impact of ceremonial use of ayahuasca-a psychedelic brew containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and β-carboline -and attendance at União do Vegetal (UDV) meetings on substance abuse; here we report the findings related to alcohol and tobacco use disorder. A total of 1,947 members of UDV 18+ years old were evaluated in terms of years of membership and ceremonial attendance during the previous 12 months. Participants were recruited from 10 states from all major regions of Brazil. Alcohol and tobacco use was evaluated through questionnaires first developed by the World Health Organization and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Analyses compared levels of alcohol and tobacco use disorder between the UDV and a national normative sample (n = 7,939). Binomial tests for proportions indicated that lifetime use of alcohol and tobacco was higher in UDV sample compared to the Brazilian norms for age ranges of 25-34 and over 34 years old, but not for the age range of 18-24 years old. However, current use disorders for alcohol and tobacco were significantly lower in the UDV sample than the Brazilian norms. Regression analyses revealed a significant impact of attendance at ayahuasca ceremonies during the previous 12 months and years of UDV membership on the reduction of alcohol and tobacco use disorder."
"5359","1","Adolescent ecstasy and other drug use in the National Survey of Parents and Youth: The role of sensation-seeking, parental monitoring and peer's drug use.^
The association between high sensation-seeking, close friends' drug use and low parental monitoring with ecstasy (MDMA) use in adolescence was examined in a sample of US household-dwelling adolescents aged 12-18 years (N = 5049). We also tested whether associations were of stronger magnitude than associations between these correlates and marijuana or alcohol/tobacco use in adolescence. Data from Round 2 of the National Survey of Parents and Youth (NSPY) Restricted Use Files (RUF) was analyzed via Jackknife weighted multinomial logistic regression models. High sensation-seekers were more likely to be ecstasy, marijuana, and alcohol/tobacco users, respectively, as compared to low sensation-seekers. High sensation-seeking and close friends' drug use were more strongly associated with ecstasy as compared to marijuana and alcohol/tobacco use. Low parental monitoring was associated with marijuana use and alcohol/tobacco use and there was a trend for it to be associated with ecstasy use. Ecstasy use is strongly associated with peer drug use and more modestly associated with high sensation-seeking. School prevention programs should target high-sensation-seeking adolescents and also encourage them to affiliate with non-drug using peers. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"2952","0","Nonhuman primate model of schizophrenia using a noninvasive EEG method.^
There is growing evidence that impaired sensory-processing significantly contributes to the cognitive deficits found in schizophrenia. For example, the mismatch negativity (MMN) and P3a event-related potentials (ERPs), neurophysiological indices of sensory and cognitive function, are reduced in schizophrenia patients and may be used as biomarkers of the disease. In agreement with glutamatergic theories of schizophrenia, NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine, elicit many symptoms of schizophrenia when administered to normal subjects, including reductions in the MMN and the P3a. We sought to develop a nonhuman primate (NHP) model of schizophrenia based on NMDA-receptor blockade using subanesthetic administration of ketamine. This provided neurophysiological measures of sensory and cognitive function that were directly comparable to those recorded from humans. We first developed methods that allowed recording of ERPs from humans and rhesus macaques and found homologous MMN and P3a ERPs during an auditory oddball paradigm. We then investigated the effect of ketamine on these ERPs in macaques. As found in humans with schizophrenia, as well as in normal subjects given ketamine, we observed a significant decrease in amplitude of both ERPs. Our findings suggest the potential of a pharmacologically induced model of schizophrenia in NHPs that can pave the way for EEG-guided investigations into cellular mechanisms and therapies. Furthermore, given the established link between these ERPs, the glutamatergic system, and deficits in other neuropsychiatric disorders, our model can be used to investigate a wide range of pathologies."
"7057","1","The role of the serotonin 2A receptor in the fabric and modulation of personal meaning in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced states.^
Abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to stimuli are critical features of many psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, and mood disorders [1]. However, the neuronal substrates enabling meaningful and personally relevant experiences are largely unknown. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical hallucinogen which has high affinity at serotonin (5‐HT)‐2A/C, ‐1A/B, ‐6, and ‐7, and dopamine D2/D1 receptors (R). Animal studies suggest that LSD produces its psychedelic effects primarily via agonist action at 5‐HT2AR although D2R may also be implicated. A core feature of LSDinduced psychedelic states is an increased sense of meaning of objects [2]. Ketanserin is a selective 5‐HT2AR antagonist which may in combination with LSD and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer the opportunity to determine the role of the 5‐HT2AR system in personal meaning processing. In a double‐blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross‐over study we therefore assessed the neural and behavioral response to personally meaningful, neutral, and personally meaningless music using fMRI and behavioral meaningfulness ratings. Twenty‐two healthy participants received either (1) placebo + placebo (Pla condition), (2) placebo + LSD (100 μg po, LSD condition), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg po) + LSD (100 μg po, Ket+LSD condition) at three different occasions. Subjective drug effects were assessed using the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). Behavioral data were analyzed by repeated‐measures analyses of variance with treatment (Pla, LSD, Ket+LSD) and scale (5D‐ASC scales) or music category (meaningful, neutral, meaningless) as within‐subject factors followed by Bonforroni‐corrected simple main effects analyses or paired comparisons in case of significant interactions or main effects. FMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM12. Meaningfulness ratings were increased for meaningless and neutral music under LSD compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD (all p<0.05). Furthermore, listening to meaningless music compared to neutral and personally meaningful music was associated with increased BOLD signal in medial and lateral frontal brain areas in the LSD condition compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD conditions. (brain areas: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, all p<0.05, FWE corrected). Furthermore, subjective drug effects were significantly increased after LSD administration compared to placebo on all 5D‐ASC scales (all p<0.05) except for anxiety and spiritual experience (all p>0.30). These LSDinduced effects were fully blocked by ketanserin (all p <0.05). LSD increased the attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli. This effect appears to be attributable to 5‐HT2AR stimulation, since these alterations are normalized after pretreatment with ketanserin. Furthermore, surprisingly virtually all LSD‐induced psychological effects were blocked by 5‐HT2AR antagonism, despite LSD's additional action on dopamine receptors. The current results emphasize the pivotal role of the 5‐HT2AR in the generation of personal meaning in medial and lateral frontal brains structures implicated in self‐referential processes [3]. These findings may be relevant for increasing our understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of personal meaning processing and may reveal prospective targets in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in meaning attribution."
"6061","1","Lamotrigine for Ketamine Dependence Trial.^
Introduction Ketamine is an anesthetic derivative of phencyclidine (PCP; 'Angel dust') with dissociative, analgesic and psychedelic properties. Recreational use of ketamine was first documented on the west coast of the United States in the early 1970s. Ketamine is frequently described as a ""unique drug"" because it shows hypnotic (sleep producing), analgesic (pain relieving) and amnesic (short‐term memory loss) effects; no other drug used in clinical practice combines these three important features at the same time. Ketamine produces an anaesthetic state, which has been termed ""dissociative anaesthesia"", characterized by analgesia and changes in vigilance and perception, but it is not a sedative or hypnotic. It appears that ketamine selectively interrupts the thalamocortical system. Ketamine has some anxiolytic‐ and antidepressant‐like properties in sub‐anesthetic doses. Mechanism of ketamine addiction The existence of binding sites for PCP and ketamine were first identified in 1979. Earlier reports indicate that ketamine essentially blocks the N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) subtype of glutamate receptors. The antagonism of NMDA receptor is responsible for its specific properties including psychedelic, anesthetic, analgesic, anxiolytic, antidepressant, hypnotic effects and cognitive impairment. In fact, ketamine also binds to non‐NMDA glutamate receptors and involves glutamate‐independent mechanisms associated with nicotinic and muscarinic cholinergic, monoaminergic and opioid receptors. Currently there is no specific pharmacological treatment model for ketamine dependence. Continuous urine screen plus medications for psychiatric symptoms treatment revealed fair results. Study drug: Lamotrigine Lamotrigine is an anticonvulsant drug used in the treatment of epilepsy and bipolar disorder. Besides it's sodium channels blocking effect as an antiepileptic drugs, lamotrigine also inhibits the release of glutamate through modulation of high voltage‐activated calcium currents and sodium channels. Method Patient Patients with ketamine use disorder seeking treatment at Taipei City Hospital and Psychiatric Center will be invited to participate this clinical trial. Treatment and assessment Schedule After informed consent signature with explanations about the procedure of this study, the initiation includes collecting drug use history and medical history, conducting a physical examination, and performing clinical laboratory tests. The study duration will last for 12 weeks and patients will be monitored at week 0, week 1, week 2, week 4, week 8, and week 12 for 6 times. Urinary toxicology and visual analogue scales will be checked at each visit and laboratory chemistry at each visit. Randomization The study subjects will be randomly assigned by computer‐generated numbers either to the lamotrigine or placebo group in a 1:1 ratio. Dosage of trial medication Trial medication and placebo will be sponsored by Lotus pharmaceutical, Taiwan. It is an extended release tablet form of lamotrigine or identical placebo. The preparation of double procedure will be handled by the Department of Pharmacy of Taipei City Hospital. Once a subject enters the treatment phase (after randomization) the dosage of study medication will be 25 mg/before bed (or one half placebo tablet at night) for 7 days. On day 8 (visit 2 or the beginning of week 2), the dosage will be increased, as tolerated, to 50 mg/day for another week. After then, the dosage will be increased to 100 mg/day (QD and HS) for 2 weeks. After 4 weeks, the dosage may be kept or increased, as judged by investigator, at the range of 100mg to 200mg /day to the end of 12 weeks. The dosage may be decreased at any time because of side effects, but not less than 100 mg. If the patient prefers, he or she may take all of his or her daily dose of medication in the morning or evening. The enroll period will be 2 years and total study duration will be 3 years. Concomitant and prohibited medications During study period, patients can take their original medications for systemic disord r. Due to patients with drug abuse usually have depressed mood, emotional disturbance or sleep problems during withdrawal period, benzodiazepines, or short acting novel hypnotics such as zolpidem or zaleplon can be used for ethical consideration. For those patient treated with antipsychotics due to drug‐induced psychosis, the patients can be enrolled only when the psychotic symptoms remitted and lowest dose of antipsychotic can be used during the trial period. The prohibited medications include medications which have drug‐drug interaction such as carbamazepine, phenytoin barbiturates, rifampicin, chlordiazepoxide and oral hypoglycaemics. Primary endpoint The primary endpoint will be the results from urinary drug screen of ketamine, and other substances including amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, morphine and cannabis, which will be carried out at the baseline and during each visit of the study period. Secondary endpoint Subjective visual analogue scales of craving by patient and subjective clinical global impression of severity will be the second endpoint. The Brief Addiction Severity Index of ketamine use will also be analyzed."
"579","1","Ketamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^
INTRODUCTION: First-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes exposure and response prevention behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly in combination. New and more effective treatments are needed, give that recent studies suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of the disorder. In these circumstances, ketamine, as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and glutamate modulator, offers alternative possibilities for OCD treatment. METHODS: This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of ketamine in OCD, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). Searches were carried out using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. RESULTS: Nine articles were included, of which three were randomized controlled trials, three case reports, two open-label trials, and one a retrospective chart review. Reported data have shown a potential for fast onset of action and good tolerability of ketamine for OCD, even though the principal studies used only single-session racemic ketamine treatments, administered intravenously, and the results have been erratic. In addition, none of the available evidence demonstrates whether racemic ketamine, S-ketamine, or R-ketamine has the best efficacy in controlling OCD symptoms, and only sparse evidence suggests that a combination of ketamine and psychotherapy could benefit patients with OCD. CONCLUSION: In order to advance clinical practice regarding the use of ketamine in treating OCD, future randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are required. These trials need to use larger samples to explore ketamine and its enantiomers, with different methods of administration, multiple sessions, and appropriate washout periods."
"6725","1","Saturday night fever in ecstasy/MDMA dance clubbers: Heightened body temperature and associated psychobiological changes.^
Aims and rationale: to investigate body temperature and thermal self-ratings of Ecstasy/MDMA users at a Saturday night dance club. Methods: 68 dance clubbers (mean age 21.6 years, 30 females and 38 males), were assessed at a Saturday night dance club, then 2–3 d later. Three subgroups were compared: 32 current Ecstasy users who had taken Ecstasy/MDMA that evening, 10 abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users on other psychoactive drugs, and 26 non-user controls (predominantly alcohol drinkers). In a comparatively quiet area of the dance club, each unpaid volunteer had their ear temperature recorded, and completed a questionnaire on thermal feelings and mood states. A similar questionnaire was repeated 2–3 d later by mobile telephone. Results: Ecstasy/MDMA users had a mean body temperature 1.2°C higher than non-user controls (P < 0.001), and felt significantly hotter and thirstier. The abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA polydrug user group had a mean body temperature intermediate between the other 2 groups, significantly higher than controls, and significantly lower than current Ecstasy/MDMA users. After 2–3 d of recovery, the Ecstasy/MDMA users remained significantly ‘thirstier’. Higher body temperature while clubbing was associated with greater Ecstasy/MDMA usage at the club, and younger age of first use. Higher temperature also correlated with lower elation and poor memory 2–3 d later. It also correlated positively with nicotine, and negatively with cannabis. Conclusions: Ecstasy/MDMA using dance clubbers had significantly higher body temperature than non-user controls. This heightened body temperature was associated with a number of adverse psychobiological consequences, including poor memory. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

"6455","1","Differential effects of sex on substance use between first episode psychosis patients and healthy people.^
BACKGROUND: Substance use in psychosis is an important field of study given that it can be a risk factor for the development of psychosis and can give rise to psychotic symptoms. Studies of substance use in first episode psychosis patients do not frequently assess non-pathological substance consumption among patients, but rather the prevalence of substance abuse or dependence disorders. Moreover, most of these studies do not address the effects of sex in sufficient depth, and the consumption of caffeine or tobacco, which are two of the most frequently used substances, is often not assessed. OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to compare patterns and quantities of substance use between first episode psychosis patients and healthy controls and between men and women, and explore the potential interactive effects between group (patients or controls) and sex. METHODS: A total of 158 participants (82 first episode psychosis patients and 76 healthy controls) were included in the study. Both adults and adolescents were included in the study. Frequency and amount of use of caffeine, tobacco, alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, stimulants, and opiates were gathered. RESULTS: A significant main effect of sex was found for the frequency of use of tobacco (p=.050). Main effects of group were found for the quantity of tobacco (p<.001) and cannabis (p<.001) consumed, as well as main effects of sex for the quantity of alcohol (p=.003) and cannabis (p=.017) consumed. There were also interaction effects between group and sex for the frequency of use of tobacco (p=.005) and cannabis (p=.009), and for the amount of cannabis consumed (p=.049). Qualitative differences between males and females regarding combined substance use are also reported. CONCLUSIONS: Among patients, men used tobacco more frequently than women, but this sex difference was not the same for the control group, in which women smoked more often than men. Regarding cannabis, men smoked cannabis more frequently and in larger amounts than women, but only in the patients group, whereas no sex differences for cannabis were found for the controls. Main effects of group and sex for tobacco and alcohol, as well as the lack of differences for the frequency and amount of use of caffeine, are also commented. This is the first study to assess the different effects of sex on substance use in first episode psychosis patients and healthy controls."
"1654","0","Ketamine and depression: a narrative review.^
Depression is the third leading cause of disability in the world. Depressive symptoms may be reduced within several weeks after the start of conventional antidepressants, but treatment resistance concerns one-third of patients who fail to achieve recovery. Over the last 20 years, ketamine, an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, has been described to have antidepressant properties. A literature review was conducted through an exhaustive electronic search. It was restricted to Cochrane reviews, meta-analyses, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of ketamine for major depressive disorder and/or bipolar disorder. This review included two Cochrane reviews, 14 meta-analyses and 15 trials. Ketamine was studied versus placebo, versus other comparators and as an anesthetic adjuvant before electroconvulsive therapy. In 14 publications, ketamine provided a rapid antidepressant effect with a maximum efficacy reached at 24 hrs. Its effect lasted for 1-2 weeks after infusion, but a longer-term effect is little reported. Ketamine does not seem to improve depressive symptoms at the end of electroconvulsive sessions. Safety and tolerability profiles with ketamine at low single dose are generally good in depressed patients. However, there is a lack of data concerning ketamine with repeated administration at higher doses. The clinical use of ketamine is increasing. Intranasal (S)-ketamine has recently been approved for depression by the Food and Drug Administration. It could be a promising treatment in depressed patients with suicidal ideation. Collectively, the level of proof of efficacy remains low and more RCTs are needed to explore efficacy and safety issues of ketamine in depression."

In this study we investigate the association of cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT, Val158Met) and serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) genotypes on change in cortisol concentration following 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') consumption. Forty-eight subjects (30 males, mean age 23 years), self-nominating regular clubbers provided 'in the field' pre- and post-clubbing biological samples and associated information. Of the 39 subjects who provided a post-clubbing urine sample, 21 were positive for MDMA. Plasma cortisol concentrations increased in subjects (n=48) tested for cortisol, with changes being significantly greater in the MDMA-positive group (736.9±83.2 vs. 350.9±34.5mmol/l, p=0.001). We found a positive association between the low activity COMT genotype (Met/Met) and MDMA-induced change in cortisol and also between this and change in cortisol in the whole sample (p=0.039, Bonferroni corrected). For CYP2D6, there was an association between genotype and change in cortisol, confined to subjects with MDMA-positive urine post-clubbing (p=0.003, Bonferroni corrected). There was no association with 5-HTTLPR genotype. These associations suggest that chronic use of MDMA may lead to HPA axis dysregulation and that the magnitude of this may be moderated by genetic polymorphism, and warrant further investigation in a larger sample of those who consume the drug on a regular basis. © 2012 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"4155","0","[Electroconvulsive therapy in treatment resistant depression: What is new?].^
Despite major advances in the treatment of mood disorders, major depression, a common mental disorder, remains a serious public health problem. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) regardless of the anesthetic agent used, is the most effective form of treatment in major depression and the gold standard therapy in treatment resistant depression. Ketamine is one of the anesthetic drugs approved by the Αmerican Psychiatric Association Task Force Report for use in ECT. However, it has been used infrequently as an anesthetic in ECT. The initial reports suggested that ketamine has antidepressant properties resulting in rapid antidepressant response when administered in subanesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) in slow intravenous injection in patients suffering from depression. In recent trials has been reported that ketamine as the only anesthetic or as an adjunctive to another anesthetic agent may enhance the antidepressant effect of ECT either by increasing efficacy or by producing a rapid antidepressant response. ECT with ketamine may also cause less cognitive side effects. The most notable limitations of these studies are the small number of patients enrolled and several methodological differences (patients characteristics, electrode placements, titration method, anesthetic agent used with ketamine). The results of the clinical trials have been summarized in six meta-analysis and suggest that ketamine when used as a sole anesthetic agent or as an adjunctive anesthetic in ECT may accelerates the antidepressant response but does not augment ECT efficacy. It also does not improve the cognitive profile of the treatment. Larger, double-blind randomized controlled trial are needed for a definite conclusion."

A liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometric method for the simultaneous determination of 75 abuse drugs and metabolites, including 19 benzodiazepines, 19 amphetamines, two opiates, eight opioids, cocaine, lysergic acid diethylamide, zolpidem, three piperazines and 21 metabolites in human hair samples, was developed and validated. Ten-milligram hair samples were decontaminated, pulverized using a ball mill, extracted with 1 mL of methanol spiked with 28 deuterated internal standards in an ultrasonic bath for 60 min at 50°C, and purified with Q-sep dispersive solid-phase extraction tubes. The purified extracts were evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in 0.1 mL of 10% methanol. The 75 analytes were analyzed on an Acquity HSS T3 column using gradient elution of methanol and 0.1% formic acid and quantified in multiple reaction monitoring mode with positive electrospray ionization. Calibration curves were linear (r ≥ 0.9951) from the lower limit of quantitation (2–200 pg/mg depending on the drug) to 2000 pg/mg. The coefficients of variation and accuracy for intra- and inter-assay analysis at three QC levels were 4.3–12.9% and 89.2–109.1%, respectively. The overall mean recovery ranged from 87.1 to 105.3%. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of 11 forensic hair samples obtained from drug abusers."

Dexmedetomidine is a highly selective α2‐adrenoceptor agonist with rapid onset of action, easy to wake up, no accumulation in the body, little inhibition of respiration, sedative, hypnotic and anxiolytic effects, and also has a certain analgesic effect.Clinical studies have shown that the use of dexmedetomidine for sedation in ICU patients is beneficial in reducing the duration of mechanical ventilation and the incidence of delirium is low, but the sedative effect of dexmedetomidine is relatively weak, and has the side effects of slowing down heart rate and lowering blood pressure, so its clinical application is limited.Esketamine is an isomer of ketamine, its effect is stronger than ketamine, and glutamate N‐methyl D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor binding, play a sedative, hypnotic, analgesic effect, rapid onset, strong effect, and small respiratory inhibition, bronchodilator effect, the disadvantage is that there is a vasoconstrictor effect can cause increased blood pressure, increased heart rate. The combination of esketamine and dexmedetomidine can provide effective sedation and analgesia with the advantages of maintaining hemodynamic stability, maintaining stable spontaneous breathing and reducing psychiatric symptoms, and has been successfully used in clinical operations such as endoscopy, pediatric anesthesia and outpatient tooth extraction. The effectiveness and safety of esketamine in combination with dexmedetomidine for the sedation of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU has not been evaluated. In this study, a prospective, randomized, controlled, single‐center study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine in combination with dexmedetomidine for the sedation of mechanically ventilated patients in the ICU."
"6426","0","Effects of experimental acute tryptophan depletion on acoustic startle response in females.^
Previous studies suggest an important role for serotonergic (5-HT) modulation of the acoustic startle reflex (ASR) and prepulse inhibition (PPI). Acute challenge of brain serotonin by means of tryptophan depletion test (TDT) represents an established human challenge tool for temporary reduction of tryptophan (-TRP) levels and central nervous serotonin. Under these experimental conditions, PPI was found attenuated in males, but greater biochemical effects of TDT in the central nervous system of females are known. Therefore, in order to explore influence of 5-HT on various standard startle parameters in females, 16 young healthy females participated in a double-blind, cross-over TDT study. Acoustic stimuli were presented in 15 pulse-alone trials (100 dB, 40 ms) randomly followed by 25 pulse-alone or prepulse (70 dB, 30 ms; 120 ms interval) trials alongside electromyographic eyeblink recordings and mood state assessments. During 81% depletion of free plasma TRP, mean ASR magnitudes were significantly reduced compared to control (+TRP) condition while there were no differences in habituation or PPI nor did startle parameters correlate with mood states. Changes of plasma TRP and mood states correlated in tendency negatively in (-TRP) for depression and positively in (+TRP) for fatigue. In conclusion, this first study of startle parameters after TDT in a homogenous female population demonstrates that depletion of brain 5-HT in women only influences ASR."

BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who fail to respond to two or more antidepressants are often considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Many of the current options for TRD have significant side effect profiles, are expensive, and are difficult to access. There has been a revival of psychedelic research in recent years that shows promising results in the treatment of TRD. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, the case of a 43-year-old man with TRD is presented. TRD symptoms were greatly interfering with his life. He underwent psychological testing, lab work, adequate trials of numerous medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electroconvulsive therapy, all without adequate relief of his symptoms. The patient began self-administering a microdosing regimen of psilocybin and experienced significant improvement of MDD symptoms, as characterized by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). DISCUSSION: In recent years, multiple randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the benefit of psilocybin in the treatment of varying types of depression. One trial evaluated psilocybin and escitalopram as treatments for depression, and psilocybin was found to be superior. CONCLUSION: This case suggests the possible benefit of psilocybin in the setting of TRD, as outlined in recent research. Additional research is needed to confirm these observations."
"4023","1","Long-term follow-up outcomes of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD: a longitudinal pooled analysis of six phase 2 trials.^
RATIONALE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that has wide-ranging negative effects on an individual's health and interpersonal relationships. Treatments with long-term benefits are needed to promote the safety and well-being of those suffering from PTSD. OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term change in PTSD symptoms and additional benefits/harms after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD. METHODS: Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2 months after the last active MDMA session (treatment exit), and at least 12 months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was summarized at each time point. Participants completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in CAPS-IV total severity scores from baseline to treatment exit (LS mean (SE) = - 44.8 (2.82), p < .0001), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.91). CAPS-IV scores continued to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE) = - 5.2 (2.29), p < .05), with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.04, 0.43). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study participation. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2 months after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12 months post-treatment. Phase 3 trials are investigating this novel treatment approach in a larger sample of participants with chronic PTSD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00090064, NCT00353938, NCT01958593, NCT01211405, NCT01689740, NCT01793610."
"9472","1","Attentional processes in abstinent methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) users.^
In recent years, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has gained great popularity among young adults. Although human research in abstinent users has focused primarily on memory function, little attention has been given to other neuropsychological functions that may have some bearing on memory performance, such as attention. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of MDMA on attentional processes. Accordingly, 24 MDMA users and 30 matched normal controls were tested on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA). We found MDMA users to show generally no significant difference on attention tasks compared with controls with the exception of a single TEA subtest. More interestingly, we found some preliminary evidence to indicate that dosage, in terms of the number of tablets used, may be related to impairment on specific component attentional tasks. This finding brings to light the important relationship between poor attentional processes and drug-taking behaviors and their reciprocal relationship."
"3692","1","Risk of bias in randomized clinical trials on psychedelic medicine: A systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: The classical psychedelics, psilocybin, peyote, ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide are considered promising new treatments for psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. However, their profound and characteristic subjective effects raise concern for distinctive biases in randomized clinical trials. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify all clinical trials on classical psychedelics with patient populations to examine descriptive data and determine the risk of bias. Two independent reviewers searched three databases (PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycNet) and extracted information on study design, study population, use of active or inactive placebo, dropouts, evaluation of blinding of intervention, and reporting of expectancy and therapeutic alliance. RESULTS: We included 10 papers reporting on 10 unique trials. The trials generally included populations that were predominantly white and highly educated. The trials had small samples and considerable dropout. Blinding was either unsuccessful or not reported regardless of type of placebo. Few trials published protocols, statistical analysis plans (SAPs), and outcomes relating to psychotherapy fidelity. All trials but one were rated as high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Successful blinding of intervention is a significant challenge in this field. To better accommodate this, we suggest that future trials use a parallel-group design and utilize an active placebo on a psychedelic-naïve population. Future trials should publish trial protocol and SAPs, use clinician-rated outcomes accessed by a blinded rater, evaluate blinding of intervention, and consider measuring expectancy and therapeutic fidelity."
"1918","1","Pharmacology of MDMA in humans.^
MDMA given at recreational doses (range tested 50 to 150 mg) to healthy volunteers, produced mydriasis and marked increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. MDMA induced changes on oral temperature. The time course of this observation was biphasic, as a slight decrease at 1 h and a slight increase at 2 and 4 h were observed. MDMA induced a slight dose-dependent impairment on psychomotor performance. MDMA produced a marked rise in plasma cortisol and prolactin concentrations. The elimination half-life of MDMA was about 8-9 h. Drug concentrations increased, and a parallel increase in physiologic and hormonal measures was observed. Both peak concentrations and peak effects were obtained between 1 and 2 h and decreased to baseline values 4-6 h after drug administration."
"4432","1","Decision-making in polydrug amphetamine-type stimulant users: an fMRI study.^
Qualitative poor decision-making and associated altered neuronal activation patterns have been described for the users of several drugs, amongst others for stimulants like amphetamine and MDMA. Deficits in decision-making might be caused by an augmented attraction to short-term rewarding properties despite negative long-term consequences, leading to rigid stimulus-response patterns. In the present imaging study, we investigated decision-making and associated neuronal activation in three groups differing in their exposure to amphetamine and MDMA. An established paradigm on risky choices was used to evaluate decision-making performance and corresponding functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) activation. Subjects could choose between a low-risk control gamble and an experimental gamble, which always differed in the probability of winning or losing, as well as the magnitudes of monetary gain or loss. Experienced users (EU), users with low exposure to stimulants and drug-naive controls, did not differ from each other in behavioral performance. In accordance with our hypotheses, the anticipation of reward led to an activation of primarily the frontal cortex and the striatum in low-exposure users and drug-naive controls. In contrast, frontal and parietal activation was observed in all groups when the actual outcome of an experimental gamble was presented. EU displayed more activation compared to both control groups when there was a high probability of winning. The study at hand supports the hypothesis that neuronal activation patterns might even differ between drug users and healthy controls when no behavioral deficits are apparent. In EU, the probability of the occurrence of an event has more influence on neuronal activation than on the actual magnitude of reinforcing properties of this event."
"3525","1","Self-Reported Illicit Drug Use Among Norwegian University and College Students. Associations With Age, Gender, and Geography.^
Background and Aims: Several studies have pointed to relatively high levels of illicit drug use among students in higher education compared to the general population. The aim of the present study was to provide an updated examination of self-reported illicit drug use among Norwegian University and college students. Methods: Data stem from the SHoT study (Students' Health and Well-being Study), a nationwide cross-sectional survey for higher education in Norway including Norwegian full-time students aged 18–35. Self-reported illicit drug use across a range of specified drugs comprised the outcome variables. Information on gender, age, and study location (geographical area) was also collected and used as stratification variables. The SHoT-survey from 2018 (N = 50,054) was used for the analyses of associations between demographical variables and illicit drug use, while trends in illicit drug use were estimated by comparing the 2018-results with data from the SHoT-surveys conducted in 2010 and 2014. Results: The proportion of students reporting having ever tried illicit drugs increased from 2014 to 2018, for both males (30.8 vs. 36.7%) and females (17.5 vs. 24.0%, both p < 0.001), while only minimal changes occurred between 2010 and 2014. The most commonly used illicit drugs during the past 12 months in 2018 were cannabis (15.2%), followed by MDMA (4.0%), cocaine (3.0%), and LSD/psilocybin (2.1%). Illicit drug use showed both linear increase with age, and inverted U-shaped relationships that peaked in the age span from 23 to 28 years of age. Males reported higher illicit drug use compared with females for all drugs. Proportions of illicit drug use varied across geographical areas within the country, with the highest use being reported in the Oslo area (the largest city and capital of Norway). Conclusions: The present study reports an increase from 2010 to 2018 among Norwegian University and college students in the proportion of those reporting to have tried illicit drugs. Despite varying proportions of use across type of drug, age, gender, and geographical location, the overall high levels of illicit drug use past 12 months confirm the need to address illicit drug use in this population."
"3044","1","The Shipibo Ceremonial Use of Ayahuasca to Promote Well-Being: An Observational Study.^
Promoting well-being is one of the main goals to improve health in the world. We examined the well-being and quality of life over the course of one year in a sample that participated in an Indigenous Shipibo healing program where traditional healers work in a series of ayahuasca ceremonies. We also explored the role of decentering as a mediator of psychological well-being. Participants who attended the program responded to an online survey that included a Psychological Well-Being Scale; Oxford Happiness Questionnaire; The World Health Organization Quality of Life Spirituality, Religiousness, and Personal Beliefs scale; the WHO Quality of Life-BREF scale; and Decentering scale. Baseline (T0) and postassessment (T1) were completed by 200 individuals. Of these, 101 completed the follow-up assessment at three months (T2), 91 at 6 months (T3), and 94 at 12 months follow-up (T4) after leaving the center. ANOVA test was performed in a representative subsample to control the passing of time two months before attending the program (T-1). Pearson’s test was performed to examine the relationship between psychological well-being and decentering during the period of T0 and T1. A significant increase was observed in all the scales at all time points (p ≤ 0.01). The subgroup analysis performed in a representative subsample allowed us to infer that the significant differences in outcomes are due to the effect of their stay at the center and not the passing of time. We found a relationship between decentering and the improvement of psychological well-being (r = 0.57; p < 0.01). Our results suggest that the Indigenous Shipibo healing work with ayahuasca has value to improve long-term well-being and quality of life for Westerners."
"7460","1","Microdosing psychedelics: Demographics, practices, and psychiatric comorbidities.^
RATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics - the practice of consuming small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of substances such as LSD or psilocybin - is gaining attention in popular media but remains poorly characterized. Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13 mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)). CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this practice in clinical populations and to test claims about potential benefits."
"1208","0","Memantine prevents the cognitive impairment induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in rats.^
Amphetamine abuse is an important risk factor for the development of cognitive impairment involving learning and memory. Since in previous studies we have demonstrated the effectiveness of alpha-7 nicotinic receptor antagonists in preventing the neurotoxicity induced by amphetamine derivatives, the present paper seeks to determine whether pre-treatment with memantine (MEM) (an antagonist of both nicotinic and NMDA receptors) counteracts the memory impairment induced by 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) administration in male Long Evans rats. In mice, MDMA and MEM induced a locomotor stimulant response but with a different profile. Moreover, MEM inhibited the rearing and thygmotaxis behaviour induced by MDMA. Non-spatial memory was tested in the object recognition test and the spatial learning and memory was tested in the Morris water maze. In our experimental conditions, rats receiving MEM pre-treatment recovered the ability to discriminate between the familiar and the novel object that had been abolished by MDMA treatment. Animals treated with MDMA showed impaired learning in the Morris water maze. Results of the probe trial demonstrated that MDMA-treated rats did not remember the location of the platform, but this memory impairment was also prevented by the MEM pre-treatment. Moreover, MEM alone improved the learning task. No differences were observed between the different groups as regards swim speed. In conclusion, MEM significantly improved the learning and memory impairment induced by MDMA and constitutes the first approach to the treatment of the long-term cognitive deficits found in ecstasy users.

"6128","1","Effect of Ketamine on Laboratory-induced Stress in Healthy Subjects.^
Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major depressive disorder (MDD) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience in at‐risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress‐induced psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience‐enhancing pharmaceuticals have been identified yet. Pre‐clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress prevents the developing of depressive‐like behavior in animals. In this project the study team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1‐week prior a laboratory‐induced stress (1) on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) ‐ Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis (HPA axis), adrenaline‐noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self‐reports of anxiety. The study team expects that subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms of negative affect and anxiety and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress."
"6712","0","The potential dangers of using MDMA for psychotherapy.^
MDMA has properties that may make it attractive for psychotherapy, although many of its effects are potentially problematic. These contrasting effects will be critically reviewed in order to assess whether MDMA could be safe for clinical usage. Early studies from the 1980s noted that MDMA was an entactogen, engendering feelings of love and warmth. However, negative experiences can also occur with MDMA since it is not selective in the thoughts or emotions it releases. This unpredictability in the psychological material released is similar to another serotonergic drug, LSD. Acute MDMA has powerful neurohormonal effects, increasing cortisol, oxytocin, testosterone, and other hormone levels. The release of oxytocin may facilitate psychotherapy, whereas cortisol may increase stress and be counterproductive. MDMA administration is followed by a period of neurochemical recovery, when low serotonin levels are often accompanied by lethargy and depression. Regular usage can also lead to serotonergic neurotoxicity, memory problems, and other psychobiological problems. Proponents of MDMA-assisted therapy state that it should only be used for reactive disorders (such as PTSD) since it can exacerbate distress in those with a prior psychiatric history. Overall, many issues need to be considered when debating the relative benefits and dangers of using MDMA for psychotherapy."
"4700","1","Cognitive function and mood in MDMA/THC users, THC users and non-drug using controls.^
Repeated ecstasy (MDMA) use is reported to impair cognition and cause increased feelings of depression and anxiety. Yet, many relevant studies have failed to control for use of drugs other than MDMA, especially marijuana (THC). To address these confounding effects we compared behavioural performance of 11 MDMA/THC users, 15 THC users and 15 non-drug users matched for age and intellect. We tested the hypothesis that reported feelings of depression and anxiety and cognitive impairment (memory, executive function and decision making) are more severe in MDMA/THC users than in THC users. MDMA/THC users reported more intense feelings of depression and anxiety than THC users and non-drug users. Memory function was impaired in both groups of drug users. MDMA/THC users showed slower psychomotor speed and less mental flexibility than non-drug users. THC users exhibited less mental flexibility and performed worse on the decision making task compared to non-drug users but these functions were similar to those in MDMA/THC users. It was concluded that MDMA use is associated with increased feelings of depression and anxiety compared to THC users and non-drug users. THC users were impaired in some cognitive abilities to the same degree as MDMA/THC users, suggesting that some cognitive impairment attributed to MDMA is more likely due to concurrent THC use."
"8387","1","Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced abnormal perception and thought process but not mood changes.^
PURPOSE: To determine the effects of midazolam, 30 ngxmL(-1), on altered perception, mood, and cognition induced by ketamine. METHODS: After ketamine was administered to achieve target concentrations of 50, 100, or 150 ngxmL in 11 volunteers, perception, mood, and thought process were assessed by a visual analog scale. Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) assessed cognition. Boluses of midazolam, 30, 14.5, and 12 microgxkg(-1), were injected every 30 min to maintain the plasma concentration at 30 ngxmL(-1), which was reached 30 min after each injection. RESULTS: Ketamine produced changes in perception about the body (P < 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 at 30, 60, and 90 min), surroundings (P < 0.01 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), time (P < 0.002 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), reality (P < 0.001 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), sounds (P < 0.002 at 90 min), and meaning (P < 0.05 at 90 min). Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities. Within the range of observation, co-administration did not affect the changes in mood or recall. CONCLUSION: Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced changes in perception and thought process."
"3110","0","The NIMH 'Fast-Fail Trials' (FAST) Initiative: Rationale, Promise, and Progress.^
In 2012, the US National Institute of Mental Health launched three clinical trial contracts under a new FAST initiative. The overall goal for these contracts (Fast-Fail Trials) was to focus early-stage trials, testing novel pharmacologic agents that target the central nervous system, on pharmacologic-based designs to objectively identify doses that produce central nervous system effects. The three contracts targeted different psychiatric populations: psychotic (FAST-PS), mood and anxiety (FAST-MAS), and autism spectrum disorders (FAST-AS). The FAST initiative was a first attempt for the National Institute of Mental Health to adapt an experimental medicine approach to its clinical trial portfolio. As the Fast-Fail trials implemented this new approach for the field, we present the rationale for each trial, design considerations, results, and how each one contributed new knowledge to the field of psychopharmacology; important lessons for pharma and biotech. Under the FAST initiative, the National Institute of Mental Health assembled research teams with a broad range of expertise, who developed and validated the outcome measures and study protocol, and conducted multi-site clinical trials, testing candidate compounds. In the FAST-PS contract, the team validated an imaging-based pharmacodynamic biomarker of the effect of ketamine in the brain that could be utilized in subsequent clinical trials. The initial FAST-AS study was an important first step in the design of early-stage target-engagement trials in autism spectrum disorder, suggesting that a resting electroencephalogram can be used as a pharmacodynamic measure in future studies. The FAST-MAS study showed that blocking the kappa-opioid receptor significantly affects functional magnetic resonance imaging ventral striatal activation in the monetary incentive delay task in anticipation of gain. Together, the outcomes of the FAST-FAIL trials demonstrated the importance of rigorously designed and informative central nervous system trials, including the value of pharmacodynamic measures in early-stage trials. Use of these measures furthered our knowledge about the relationship between specific molecular mechanisms, brain effects, and therapeutic effects in patients with mental illnesses."
"2263","0","Neurotoxic effects of MDMA (Ecstasy) on the developing rodent brain.^
The incidence of methamphetamine abuse is particularly high in adolescents and is a common problem among women of childbearing age, leading to an increasing number of children with prenatal exposure. MDMA (3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is an amphetamine-like stimulant and is known to induce apoptotic damage to fine serotonergic fibers in the adult rat brain. Little is known about toxic effects of MDMA and potential underlying molecular mechanisms in the developing brain. Here, we investigated whether MDMA exposure during the period of rapid brain growth causes neurodegeneration in the developing rat brain. MDMA significantly enhanced neuronal death in the brains of 6-day-old rat pups at a dose of 60 mg/kg, but no significant toxicity was detected at the ages of 14 and 21 days. Brain regions mainly affected were the cortex, septum, thalamus, hypothalamus and the cornu ammonis 1 region. To explore possible molecular mechanisms involved in this neurodegenerative process, we investigated the impact of MDMA on the expression of the neurotrophins brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) and nerve growth factor. Neonatal exposure of 6-day-old rats to MDMA triggered a considerable increase in cortical BDNF and NT-3 levels. Moreover, P7 CD1/BDNF knockout mice were noticeably more sensitive to MDMA exposure as compared to their wild-type age-matched littermates. These data suggest that a single injection of MDMA causes neurodegeneration in the neonatal rat brain. The upregulation of BDNF and NT-3 expression may indicate an important compensatory mechanism leading to the survival of neuronal cells in the developing brain. © 2010 S. Karger AG, Basel."
"2473","1","Depressive symptomatology in young adults with a history of MDMA use: A longitudinal analysis.^
Research suggests that methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/'ecstasy' can cause serotonin depletion as well as serotonergic neurodegradation that may result in depression. This longitudinal study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess depressive symptomatology every six months over a two-year period among a community sample of young adult MDMA/'ecstasy' users (n = 402). Multilevel growth modeling was used to analyze changes in BDI scores. Between baseline and 24 months, the mean BDI score declined from 9.8 to 7.7. Scores varied significantly across individuals at baseline and declined at a rate of 0.36 points every six months. Persons with higher baseline scores were more likely to have their scores decrease over time. Several factors were significantly associated with score levels, independent of time: gender - men's scores were lower than women's; ethnicity - whites' scores were lower than those of non-whites; education - persons with at least some university education had scores that were lower than those without any college experience; benzodiazepines - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; opioids - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; and cumulative ecstasy use - people who had used MDMA more than 50 times had scores that were higher than persons who had used the drug less often. The results reported here show low levels of depressive symptoms among a sample that, after 24 months, consisted of both current and former MDMA users. The low and declining mean scores suggest that for most people MDMA/'ecstasy' use does not result in long-term depressive symptomatology. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology."

Background: A significant minority of Australians engage in concurrent drug use (using more than one drug in a given period). We examined clusters and correlates of concurrent drug use using the latest available nationally representative survey data on Australian young adults. Sample: 3836 participants aged 18-29. years (mean age 24. years) from the 2010 National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS). Method: Clusters were distilled using latent class analysis of past year use of alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, inhalants, steroids, barbiturates, meth/amphetamines, heroin, methadone/buprenorphine, other opiates, painkillers and tranquillisers/sleeping pills. Results: Concurrent drug use in this sample was best described using a 4-class solution. The majority (87.5%) of young adults predominantly used alcohol only (50.9%) or alcohol and tobacco (36.6%). 10.2% reported using alcohol, tobacco, marijuana, and ecstasy, and 2.3% reported using an extensive range of drugs. Conclusion: Most drug use clusters were robust in their profile and stable in their prevalence, indicating little meaningful change at the population level from 2007. The targeting of alcohol and tobacco use remains a priority, but openness to experiencing diverse drug-related effects remains a significant concern for 12.5% of young people in this age group. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd."

"5318","0","The cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of chronic, treatment-resistant PTSD.^
BACKGROUND: Chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a disabling condition that generates considerable morbidity, mortality, and both medical and indirect social costs. Treatment options are limited. A novel therapy using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown efficacy in six phase 2 trials. Its cost-effectiveness is unknown. METHODS AND FINDINGS: To assess the cost-effectiveness of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy (MAP) from the health care payer's perspective, we constructed a decision-analytic Markov model to portray the costs and health benefits of treating patients with chronic, severe, or extreme, treatment-resistant PTSD with MAP. In six double-blind phase 2 trials, MAP consisted of a mean of 2.5 90-minute trauma-focused psychotherapy sessions before two 8-hour sessions with MDMA (mean dose of 125 mg), followed by a mean of 3.5 integration sessions for each active session. The control group received an inactive placebo or 25-40 mg. of MDMA, and otherwise followed the same regimen. Our model calculates net medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios. Efficacy was based on the pooled results of six randomized controlled phase 2 trials with 105 subjects; and a four-year follow-up of 19 subjects. Other inputs were based on published literature and on assumptions when data were unavailable. We modeled results over a 30-year analytic horizon and conducted extensive sensitivity analyses. Our model calculates expected medical costs, mortality, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratio. Future costs and QALYs were discounted at 3% per year. For 1,000 individuals, MAP generates discounted net savings of $103.2 million over 30 years while accruing 5,553 discounted QALYs, compared to continued standard of care. MAP breaks even on cost at 3.1 years while delivering 918 QALYs. Making the conservative assumption that benefits cease after one year, MAP would accrue net costs of $7.6 million while generating 288 QALYS, or $26,427 per QALY gained. CONCLUSION: MAP provided to patients with severe or extreme, chronic PTSD appears to be cost-saving while delivering substantial clinical benefit. Third-party payers are likely to save money within three years by covering this form of therapy."

Objective: Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression. But it is not known how quickly this occurs and how long it persists. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of ketamine for suicidality. Method: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched until 12 December 2018. Randomised controlled trials of ketamine or esketamine reporting data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, attempted or completed suicide in adults diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = −0.51, 95% confidence interval = [−1.00, −0.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.63, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.57, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

"808","1","Combination therapy with transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine for treatment-resistant depression: a long-term retrospe.^
Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). Methods: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2‐4.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10‐30 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up. Results: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test (α=0.01, t=22.81 p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. Conclusions: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."
"9040","1","Visuospatial memory impairments in users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^
RATIONALE: Previous studies have presented conflicting findings regarding visuospatial span deficits in MDMA ('ecstasy') users, possibly attributable to a lack of distinction between simple visuospatial span and visuospatial working memory span. Both draw upon central executive processing, while the latter also involves concurrent goal-orientated visuospatial processing. OBJECTIVES: This study compared visuospatial working memory span for MDMA users and controls. An additional concurrent task also loading on the central executive tested for inter-group differences related to central executive workload. METHOD: MDMA user group (25 current users, 10 previous users and 18 non-users) was between-participants, and dual task condition (concurrent alphabetic generation, random letter generation, and no dual task) was within-participants. The visuospatial working memory task required participants to serially recall a spatial sequence while simultaneously completing a visual judgement task, and was completed on its own and under dual task conditions. RESULTS: Overall, non-users performed significantly better than both MDMA user groups. However, contrary to expectation, the performance decrement among users was no worse with concurrent random generation than under control conditions. Analyses controlling for background variables and the use of other drugs in the previous 3 months showed that the main effect of MDMA remained significant following control for intelligence, alcohol, amphetamines and cocaine, among other potential confounds. Unclear results were found following control for cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: The MDMA users experienced deficits in visuospatial working memory span. The lack of interaction between dual task condition and user group may be due to inter-group differences in central executive utilisation under different task conditions."

"548","0","Cannabis psychosis: examining the evidence for a distinctive psychopathology in a systematic and narrative review.^
BACKGROUND: The term ""cannabis psychosis"" has become ubiquitous in the psychiatric literature. Few authors have described the precise psychopathology of this potentially distinct subtype of psychosis. Specifically, little attention has been paid to exploring whether cannabis psychosis is characterized by a psychopathology which is different from that of other types of psychosis. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this paper was to systematically review the literature for evidence of a specific constellation of symptoms which are consistently characteristic of cannabis psychosis within an inpatient psychiatric setting and to determine whether these combine to create a psychopathology which is distinct from that of other types of psychosis. METHOD: Systematic review using Meta-analysis Of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) guidelines. RESULTS: 13 studies of the 439 identified met the inclusion criteria. Only eight studies had sufficient internal and external validity to allow comparison in a narrative format of the psychopathology present, compared with controls. Of these eight selected studies, seven reported at least one significant difference (p < .05) in the psychopathology of the cannabis group to the control group used as a comparator. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: This study should be interpreted with great caution and conclusions should not be generalized. These findings do not suggest that ""cannabis psychosis"" does not exist, only that from a psychopathological perspective it may not be qualitatively any different from other forms of psychosis. Future research in this area needs to focus on clarifying the definition or description of ""cannabis psychosis"" and the use of standardized robust experimental and/or observational designs to eliminate heterogeneity that may lead to inconclusive results."
"6212","1","Clinical Predictors of Intravenous Ketamine Response in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
Study Design: This will be a randomized, double‐blinded, midazolam‐controlled crossover trial. There is no perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent for participation, the day before infusion (Day ‐1), participants will complete a set of rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID; 30μg/kg over 40 minutes). We will randomize infusion sequences in a 1‐to‐1 ratio: KET followed by MID (K→M) or vice versa (M→K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and Day 21, separated by a 20‐day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. We will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Days ‐1, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41. Patients will provide daily self‐ratings of depressive symptoms (using the quick inventory of depressive symptoms 16‐item self‐rated version; QIDS 16‐SR). Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following the second infusion. Study Groups: Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30μg/kg of MID diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter reduces the response to ketamine."

The deficiency of the gaseous molecule nitric oxide (NO) seems to be critically involved in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia. Thus, molecules that can normalize NO levels, as are NO donors, might be of utility for the medication of this psychiatric disease. The aim of the present study was to detect the ability of the NO donor molsidomine to reduce schizophrenia-like impairments produced by the blockade of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor in rats. Molsidomine's ability to attenuate social withdrawal and spatial recognition memory deficits induced by the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine were assessed using the social interaction and the object location test, respectively. Further, the efficacy of the combination of sub-effective doses of molsidomine with sub-effective doses of the atypical antipsychotic clozapine in alleviating non-spatial recognition memory deficits was evaluated utilizing the object recognition task. Molsidomine (2 and 4 mg/kg) attenuated social withdrawal and spatial recognition memory deficits induced by ketamine. Co-administration of inactive doses of molsidomine (1 mg/kg) and clozapine (0.1 mg/kg) counteracted delay-dependent and ketamine-induced non-spatial recognition memory deficits. The current findings suggest that molsidomine is sensitive to glutamate hypofunction since it attenuated behavioral impairments in animal models mimicking the negative symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia. Additionally, the present results support the potential of molsidomine as an adjunctive drug for the therapy of schizophrenia."
"1144","0","Rater-specific interference factors in clinical trials.^
By means of the clinical trial the psychiatrist tries to verify the effect of a new medication by proving changes on the psychopathological symptom level. This proof, however, depends on the complicated process of the psychiatrist's judgement-forming. The susceptibility to disturbance factors upon the different parts of the judgement process cannot be sized up easily enough for the time being. Perception problems as well as judgement problems have an effect. The relationships between rater and examined person, between rater and given information material as well as between rater and the corresponding duty turned out to be especially important for the process of judgement. In order to obtain practical progress with the present knowledge of the control of rater-specific variables, certain rater functions are determined as starting points. These are the interview, the scheduled psychopathological individual characteristics and the evaluation of the psychopathological syndrome. Controlling measures will be effective when these three rater functions can be made more independent from subjective rater tendencies by standardisation. It is stated that the results of social-psychological interview research will be made more useful for the psychiatric interview guidance. Furthermore, they must be brought up in the development of partly structured interview guidance. Up to now, experiences with partly structured interviews speak for the possibility of taking into account special conditions of the communication situation between patient and physician. The susceptibility to disturbance of the psychopathologic symptom scheduling can be clearly reduced by the use of a good glossary. In addition to a distinct limitation of each characteristic dimension for a psychopathological single characteristic, more defined criteria must be worked out in order to quantify an item. Besides, the development of simple and valid rating-scales for the nursing staff is suggested, as one can here rather work with operationalized definitions than by using the complex terms of descriptive psychopathology. The use of binding criteria-catalogues is emphasized concerning the selection of the volunteers. On the other hand, however, more defined, e.g. biochemical or psychophysiological parameters should be considered - if possible - in the future. Finally, the advantages of using audio-visual methods is stated. This is valid as well for training raters according to binding rules as well as for defined, better evaluation strategies (e.g. time-blind-analysis of TV-stored interviews)."
"121","1","Comprehensive assessment of side effects associated with a single dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Concerns about ketamine for treating depression include abuse potential and the occurrence of psychotomimetic effects. This study sought to comprehensively assess side effects (SEs) associated with a single subanesthetic-dose intravenous ketamine infusion. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) scores and dissociative symptoms reported on a comprehensive, clinician-administered SE questionnaire. METHODS: Data from 188 participants were pooled from four placebo-controlled, crossover ketamine trials and one open-label study (n = 163 with either treatment-resistant major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and 25 healthy controls). SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion and monitored over the time-course of each study. Statistical analyses assessed the effect of drug (ketamine, placebo) on SEs and measured the relationship between CADSS total score and SEs contemporaneously endorsed during structured interviews. RESULTS: Forty-four of 120 SEs occurred in at least 5% of participants over all trials. Thirty-three of these 44 SEs were significantly associated with active drug administration (versus placebo). The most common SE was feeling strange/weird/loopy. Most SEs peaked within an hour of ketamine administration and resolved completely by two hours post-infusion. No serious drug-related adverse events or increased ketamine craving/abuse post-administration were observed. A positive correlation was found between dissociative SEs and total CADSS score. LIMITATIONS: The post-hoc nature of the analysis; the limited generalizability of a single subanesthetic-dose ketamine infusion; and the lack of formal measures to assess ketamine's cognitive, urological, or addictive potential. CONCLUSIONS: No long-lasting significant SEs occurred over the approximately three-month follow-up period."

The success of blinding will be tested after each ketamine treatment with a questionnaire given to the subject, raters, and treating physician."
"9176","0","KETAMINE: A POTENTIAL RAPID-ACTING ANTISUICIDAL AGENT?.^
Ketamine has attracted widespread attention as a potential rapid-acting antidepressant. There is also considerable interest in its use for the rapid treatment of patients deemed at risk for suicide. Here, we review the available evidence (open-label and randomized controlled trials) that examine the effects of ketamine on suicidal ideation (SI). Overall, data suggest that ketamine has a rapid albeit transient effect in reducing SI, though some studies had mixed results at different time points or using different assessments. Weaknesses to the existing literature include the small sample sizes of the studies, the exclusion of patients with significant SI at baseline from many of the studies, and the potential functional unblinding when participants are randomized to saline as placebo. The evidence supporting the clinical use of ketamine for SI is very preliminary. Although ketamine appears to a promising therapeutic option in a context where there is a great unmet need (i.e., patients at imminent risk of suicide), further controlled trials are needed to allow for meaningful clinical recommendations."
"2235","0","Ketamine, sleep, and depression: current status and new questions.^
Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has well-described rapid antidepressant effects in clinical studies of individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Preclinical studies investigating the effects of ketamine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and on sleep slow wave activity (SWA) support its use as a prototype for investigating the neuroplastic mechanisms presumably involved in the mechanism of rapidly acting antidepressants. This review discusses human EEG slow wave sleep parameters and plasma BDNF as central and peripheral surrogate markers of plasticity, and their use in assessing ketamine's effects. Acutely, ketamine elevates BDNF levels, as well as early night SWA and high-amplitude slow waves; each of these measures correlates with change in mood in depressed patients who respond to ketamine. The slow wave effects are limited to the first night post-infusion, suggesting that their increase is part of an early cascade of events triggering improved mood. Increased total sleep and decreased waking occur during the first and second night post infusion, suggesting that these measures are associated with the enduring treatment response observed with ketamine."

Aims: The purpose of this study was to compare the effects of mephedrone and 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), as reported by young recreational polydrug users. Methods: 152 MDMA users and 81 mephedrone users were recruited through snowballing on social network sites. They completed a standard online questionnaire for either mephedrone or MDMA. The questions covered the average amount taken per session, the longest duration of usage in the last 12-months, subjective effects while on-drug, and recovery effects in the days afterwards. Results: Mephedrone users reported a significantly longer maximum session of use than MDMA users. Mephedrone users also reported a significantly greater average amount used per session. The majority of on-drug subjective ratings did not differ between drugs, with similar increases in entactogenic effects. Although mephedrone users did report significantly more frequent issues with sleeping, anger and anxiety. In relation to recovery, mephedrone users reported more frequent craving, nasal irritation, paranoia, and relationship difficulties. Mephedrone users also rated general recovery effects as more severe over the seven-day period following use, taking more days to feel normal. Conclusions: The acute effects of MDMA and mephedrone were broadly similar. However, the recovery period for mephedrone was more enduring, possibly due to the longer duration of acute session usage."
"5849","1","Randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the effect and safety of sketamine in aiding the improvement of standard care for Post Traumatic Stress Disorder.^
INTERVENTION: Randomized, double‐blind, crossover, placebo‐controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy of esketamine in augmenting standard treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder. 35 patients aged 18 to 65 years with diagnoses of PTSD will receive the study medication (esketamine) in a crossover, double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled (midazolam) design added to standard care. Standard treatment is understood as the therapy instituted naturally, initiated before entering the study. The study medication will be esketamine in intravenous infusion. Individuals will receive an infusion of midazolam (0.045mg/kg) and another of esketamine (0.5mg/kg), one week apart. Patients will be randomly assigned to the order in which they received the two infusions (esketamine‐midazolam or midazolam‐esketamine) using a list of random numbers. Study solutions will be provided in identical 50 mL syringes containing either midazolam or esketamine with the additional volume of saline for a total of 50 mL. Esketamine forms a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline just like midazolam. All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes via an infusion pump. Patients will receive a single dose of esketamine or midazolam, given intravenously (through a vein) over 40 minutes. After 7 days, patients receive another dose of study drug in a crossover fashion; that is, those who previously used esketamine are switched to receive placebo, and those who received placebo are switched to esketamine. During the infusions, pulse oximetry (measurement of oxygen in the blood), heart rate and blood pressure will be measured continuously from 15 minutes before to 4 hours after each dose of esketamine or placebo to monitor safety. No patient will be released from the study protocol witho CONDITION: Post‐traumatic stress state PRIMARY OUTCOME: To compare between the control and placebo groups of changes in post‐traumatic stress disorder symptoms measured from the change in the Impact of Event Scale–Revised total score between the pre‐drug assessment and the assessment 24 hours after application. We will use as a method a linear mixed model of fixed effects using the Impact of Event Scale – Revised scores as the dependent variable, time (representing the different moments), treatment and their interaction as fixed effects and individuals as random effects. Main effects will be analyzed using the F statistic, and post hoc paired analyzes will be conducted with Tukey correction for multiple comparisons. The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data. Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests. The primary analysis will follow the intent‐to‐treat principle. Significance is assessed at P < 0.05, two‐tailed. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Evaluate the changes in symptoms from the variation in the total score of the Clinical Global Impression–Severity, Clinical Global Impression–Improvemen, Patient Global Impression of Severity, Patient Global Impression of Change, and Montgomery‐Asberg depression scale scales between assessment before application of drugs and evaluations for days 2, 3, 4, 7 and 14 after application. We will use the method described for the primary outcome. Evaluate the changes in symptoms of post‐traumatic stress disorder measured from the variation in the total score of the Impact of Event Scale– Revised scale, between the assessment before drug administration and the assessment 72 hours after application.

We will use the method described for the primary outcome. To compare the proportion of responders (subjects who achieved a reduction of at least 50% of symptoms by the Impact of Event Scale–Revised scale) of the control group and placebo after 24 hours of application. We will use as a method to compare the proportions of the placebo and control groups using Pearson&apos;s chi‐square test or Fisher&apos;s exact test for proportions. Differences will be accepted using a 95% confidence interval, in a one‐sided test. To detect possible biological predictors, by verifying the capacity of peripheral biomarkers such as BDNF, cytokines (IL‐1, IL‐6, TNF‐alpha, IFN), microRNAs, tryptophan metabolites, urea and esketamine serum level and their respective metabolites can predict and/or quantify symptom response to esketamine treatment. We will use the general linear model of repeated measures as a method to assess changes over time in Impact of Event Scale–Revised scores and levels of biomarkers and assess possible differences between the two intervention groups. Differences in biomarker levels over time between responders and non‐responders will be analyzed with the same model. Spearman rank correlation coefficients will be used to assess the relationship between biomarker levels and Impact of Event Scale–Revised scale scores at each time point, and between changes in biomarker levels and Impact scale scores. of Event Scale– Revised from baseline to 24 hours.

Objectives To describe drug use, types of drugs and related factors among money boys in Hunan Province, China. Study design A cross-sectional study was conducted between July 2012 and January 2013. Methods Based on respondent-driven sampling, researchers located seven ‘seeds’ via a gay-dating website: http://www.ixxqy.org. After three waves of recruitment, 234 money boys were enrolled. They were asked to complete a 23-item questionnaire regarding demographic characteristics, drug use, a history of human immunodeficiency virus infection and family environment. Descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis were conducted using Statistical Package for the Social Sciences Version 20.0. Results In total, 205 valid questionnaires were collected. Based on the data collected, 80 (39.0%) money boys had used drugs within the last 3 months. Rush popper (36.6%) and methamphetamine (12.7%) were used most commonly, and other drugs used were ecstasy (7.8%), ketamine (5.9%), marijuana (2.4%), morphine (1.5%), heroin (1.0%) and cocaine (0.5%). Factors included in the logistic regression were length of service (odds ratio [OR] 0.395, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.175–0.896), being an only child (OR 2.272, 95% CI 1.108–4.659), relationship between parents (OR 0.428, 95% CI 0.213–0.858) and social network (OR 2.387, 95% CI 1.144–4.970). A shorter length of service and a good relationship between parents were protective factors against drug use, while being an only child and having a wide social network were risk factors. Conclusion Drug use is common among money boys. This study found that length of service, being an only child, relationship between parents and social network are associated with drug use."
"8554","1","DMT Models the Near-Death Experience.^
Near-death experiences (NDEs) are complex subjective experiences, which have been previously associated with the psychedelic experience and more specifically with the experience induced by the potent serotonergic, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Potential similarities between both subjective states have been noted previously, including the subjective feeling of transcending one's body and entering an alternative realm, perceiving and communicating with sentient 'entities' and themes related to death and dying. In this within-subjects placebo-controled study we aimed to test the similarities between the DMT state and NDEs, by administering DMT and placebo to 13 healthy participants, who then completed a validated and widely used measure of NDEs. Results revealed significant increases in phenomenological features associated with the NDE, following DMT administration compared to placebo. Also, we found significant relationships between the NDE scores and DMT-induced ego-dissolution and mystical-type experiences, as well as a significant association between NDE scores and baseline trait 'absorption' and delusional ideation measured at baseline. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap in nearly all of the NDE phenomenological features when comparing DMT-induced NDEs with a matched group of 'actual' NDE experiencers. These results reveal a striking similarity between these states that warrants further investigation."
"7815","1","Depressive and anxiety symptomatology in ecstasy users: The relative contribution of genes, trauma, life stress and drug use.^
Rationale: Previous research has identified elevated rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms amongst ecstasy users; however, few studies have examined which factors increase the likelihood of experiencing such symptoms. Objectives: The current study aimed to determine the relationship between ecstasy use and depressive/anxiety symptomatology after controlling for known environmental and genetic (polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene) risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Timeline methods were used to collect information on lifetime and recent ecstasy use, as well as recent other drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Results: Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These results highlight the need to consider the role of environmental factors when examining the relationship between ecstasy use and mood symptoms. Whether ecstasy exacerbates such symptoms in vulnerable individuals requires further investigation using prospective designs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."

OBJECTIVE Δ9‐Tetrahydrocannabinol (thc, dronabinol) produces transient psychomimetic effects in healthy volunteers, constituting a pharmacologic model for psychosis. The dopaminergic antagonist haloperidol has previously been shown to reduce these effects. This study aimed to further explore this model. DESIGN Randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled cross‐over study. METHODS The effect of a single oral dose of olanzapine [with dopaminergic, serotonergic, adrenergic, muscarinergic and hista‐minergic properties] or two oral doses of diphenhydramine (histamine antagonist) on the effects of thc inhalation was examined in 49 healthy, male, mild cannabis users. RESULTS Transient psychomimetic symptoms were seen after thc administration, as measured on the positive and negative syndrome scale [20.6% increase on positive subscale, P < 0.001] and the visual analogue scale for psychedelic effects (increase of 10.7 mm on feeling high). Following the combination of thc and olanzapine, the positive subscale increased by only 13.7% and feeling high by only 8.7 mm. This reduction of thc effects on the positive subscale failed to reach statistical significance (P = 0.066). However, one third of the subjects did not show an increase in psychomimetic symptoms after thc alone. Within responders, olanzapine reduced the effects of thc on the positive subscale (P = 0.005). Other outcome measures included pharmacokinetics, eye movements, postural stability, pupil/iris ratio, and serum concentrations of Cortisol and prolactin. CONCLUSION Inhalation of thc led to a transient increase in psychomimetic symptoms. In responders, these symptoms could be reduced by co‐administration of olanzapine."
"8865","0","Clinical studies of markers of the indolic hypermethylation in human perception alterations.^
Biochemical markers were studied in 34 psychotic patients compared to controls, e. g., dosage of platelet monoamine oxidase (MAO) and serum amine oxidase (AO), transmethylation activity, and dosage of the urinary N,N-dimethylindolealkylamines, bufotenine and N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Neuropsychological tests were simultaneously performed to evaluate psychometric parameters in the same subjects under study. Urinary levels of DMT and bufotenine were evaluated by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. The enzymes were dosed by spectrofluorimetric methods. Relationships were established between the statistically significant values of urinary bufotenine and platelet MAO, and of urinary DMT and both platelet MAO and serum AO. The statistically significant values of platelet MAO and those of transmethylation activity were satisfactorily correlated, thus achieving the 91.1% categorization of the 34 subjects in four main types. The sharp decrease in platelet MAO was in agreement with the increase in bufotenine and DMT, and with the perceptual alteration observed in neuropsychological tests. The decrease in serum AO was moderate, but consistent with the transmethylating activity registered. The results support the pathologic transmethylation theory of schizophrenia, and show that these N,N-methylated indolealkylamines are state markers for these pathologies."
"8710","1","How to account for hallucinations in the interpretation of the antidepressant effects of psychedelics: a translational framework.^
RATIONALE: Recent trials with psychedelics in major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression showed remarkable improvements in depressive symptoms that can last for up to several months after even a single administration. The lack of an appropriate placebo control group-as patients are often able to discriminate the subjective effects of the drug-and an incomplete understanding of the role of the hallucinogenic and mystical experience, hampers the interpretation of these therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVES: To control for these factors, we developed a translational framework based on establishing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in rodents and humans for hallucinogenic (i.e., discriminative stimulus effects in rodents and humans; head twitch responses in rodents; questionnaires in humans) and therapeutic effects. For the latter, we selected the pattern separation and attentional set-shifting tasks as measures for cognitive flexibility because of their high translational value. We predict that these PK/PD analyses will lead to a more objective evaluation of improvements in patients compared to relying only on the currently used self-reported questionnaires. We hypothesize that-if the role of the hallucinogenic experience is not central in the antidepressant effects of psychedelics-the ED(50)'s for the therapeutic effects will be significantly lower than for the hallucinogenic and mystical effects. CONCLUSION: Our framework will help to inform future studies that aim at the elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action of psychedelics in depression, and the role of the acute subjective and/or hallucinogenic experience in their effects."
"4568","0","Glutamatergic dysfunction in Schizophrenia.^
The NMDA-R hypofunction model of schizophrenia started with the clinical observation of the precipitation of psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia exposed to PCP or ketamine. Healthy volunteers exposed to acute low doses of ketamine experienced mild psychosis but also negative and cognitive type symptoms reminiscent of the full clinical picture of schizophrenia. In rodents, acute systemic ketamine resulted in a paradoxical increase in extracellular frontal glutamate as well as of dopamine. Similar increase in prefrontal glutamate was documented with acute ketamine in healthy volunteers with (1)H-MRS. Furthermore, sub-chronic low dose PCP lead to reductions in frontal dendritic tree density in rodents. In post-mortem ultrastructural studies in schizophrenia, a broad reduction in dendritic complexity and somal volume of pyramidal cells has been repeatedly described. This most likely accounts for the broad, subtle progressive cortical thinning described with MRI in- vivo. Additionally, prefrontal reductions in the obligatory GluN(1) subunit of the NMDA-R has been repeatedly found in post-mortem tissue. The vast (1)H-MRS literature in schizophrenia has documented trait-like small increases in glutamate concentrations in striatum very early in the illness, before antipsychotic treatment (the same structure where increased pre-synaptic release of dopamine has been reported with PET). The more recent genetic literature has reliably detected very small risk effects for common variants involving several glutamate-related genes. The pharmacological literature has followed two main tracks, directly informed by the NMDA-R hypo model: agonism at the glycine site (as mostly add-on studies targeting negative and cognitive symptoms); and pre-synaptic modulation of glutamatergic release (as single agents for acute psychosis). Unfortunately, both approaches have failed so far. There is little doubt that brain glutamatergic abnormalities are present in schizophrenia and that some of these are related to the etiology of the illness. The genetic literature directly supports a non- specific etiological role for glutamatergic dysfunction. Whether NMDA-R hypofunction as a specific mechanism accounts for any important component of the illness is still not evident. However, a glutamatergic model still has heuristic value to guide future research in schizophrenia. New tools to jointly examine brain glutamatergic, GABA-ergic and dopaminergic systems in-vivo, early in the illness, may lay the ground for a next generation of clinical trials that go beyond dopamine D2 blockade."
"1982","0","Hallucinogens, serotonin and obsessive-compulsive disorder.^
The serotonin (5-HT) neurotransmitter system has been implicated in the pathophysiology of several neuropsychiatric disorders, especially obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). Blockade of 5-HT reuptake appears to be an important initial neurobiological event in the therapeutic mechanism of action of antiobsessional drugs. However, for reasons that continue to be poorly understood, clinical improvement following initiation of treatment with 5-HT reuptake inhibitors can take up to eight to 12 weeks, and most patients do not fully improve. Recent data suggest that activation of 5-HT2A and/or 5-HT2C receptors may be important for the improvement of OCD symptoms. Most psychedelic drugs are potent agonists at 5-HT2A and 5-HT2C receptors and their binding potency to these receptors is strongly correlated with their human potency as hallucinogens. This article will briefly review the relevant clinical and preclinical studies relating to the effects of hallucinogens on OCD. These data suggest that activation of 5-HT2 receptors by hallucinogens may lead to acute reduction of, as well as possible longer-lasting beneficial effects on, the symptoms of OCD. Evidence for and against involvement of 5-HT2A and/or 5-HT2C receptors in the therapeutic effects of drug therapies for OCD are reviewed. Issues related to the pharmacological properties and safety of psychedelic drugs, when considered as potential treatments for patients with OCD, are summarized. The authors suggest that controlled trials of potent 5-HT2 agonists in people suffering from OCD are warranted."
"6200","1","Effects of LSD on Neuroplasticity in Healthy Subjects.^
Neuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself and adapt in response to changing environmental conditions or pathological stimuli. Its dysregulation may play a role in the etiology of depression and anxiety disorders, and it is also essential for recovery from neural injury and stroke. LSD is a potent psychedelic drug and a member of the psychoplastogen family of small molecules, which are able to rapidly stimulate neuroplasticity in cortical neurons following a single dose. Previous research suggests that changes in neuroplasticity may contribute to LSD's long‐term effects, which include increases in subjective well‐being and life satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and increased openness to experience. Additionally, there is some evidence that LSD and other psychedelics could be viable clinical treatments for depression, anxiety, and addictive disorders, and that changes in neuroplasticity may underlie this clinical potential. However, there is still little direct evidence that LSD or other psychoplastogens enhance cortical plasticity in humans. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of LSD on several measures of neuroplasticity in healthy human subjects, as well as other abilities and traits thought to be related to neuroplasticity. Determining whether LSD enhances cortical plasticity, how long this may last, where in the brain it occurs, and what it means for cognition and emotion is essential for understanding LSD's long‐term effects, including but not limited to its clinical potential."

Background: Drug-impaired driving has received increased attention resulting from development of rapid drug-screening procedures used by police and state laws establishing per se limits for drug levels in drivers. Venues that host electronic music dance events (EMDEs) provide a unique opportunity to assess drug-impaired driving among a high proportion of young adult drug users. EMDEs are late-night dance parties marked by a substantial number of young adult attendees and elevated drug involvement. No studies to date have examined drug-impaired driving in a natural environment with active drug and alcohol users. Methods: Six EMDEs were sampled in San Diego, California, and Baltimore, Maryland. A random sample of approximately 40 attendees per event were administered surveys about alcohol and other drug (AOD) use and driving status, given breath tests for alcohol, and asked to provide oral fluid samples to test for illicit drug use upon entering and exiting the events. Results: Driving status reduced the level of alcohol use (including abstaining) but the impact on drug-taking was not significant. However, 62% of individuals who reported their intention to drive away from the events were positive for drugs or alcohol upon leaving. This suggests that these events and settings are appropriate ones for developing interventions for reducing risks for young adults. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"5139","1","A Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Controlled Trials of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.^
After a two-decade hiatus in which research on psychedelics was essentially halted, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions have begun to be published. We identified nine randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy published since 1994. Studies examined psilocybin, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), ayahuasca (which contains a combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine oxidase inhibitor alkaloids), and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). We compared the standardized mean difference between the experimental and placebo control group at the primary endpoint. Results indicated a significant mean between-groups effect size of 1.21 (Hedges g), which is larger than the typical effect size found in trials of psychopharmacological or psychotherapy interventions. For the three studies that maintained a placebo control through a follow-up assessment, effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Overall, analyses support the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy across four mental health conditions - post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety/depression associated with a life-threatening illness, unipolar depression, and social anxiety among autistic adults. While study quality was high, we identify several areas for improvement regarding the conduct and reporting of trials. Larger trials with more diverse samples are needed to examine possible moderators and mediators of effects, and to establish whether effects are maintained over time."
"5408","1","ELEctroconvulsive therapy (ECT) vs. Ketamine in patients with Treatment-resistant Depression: The ELEKT-D study protocol.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental illness and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for MDD and the gold-standard therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet it remains underutilized due to factors such as limited availability, stigma, and concerns about cognitive side effects. Ketamine has emerged as the first rapid-acting antidepressant and shows robust short-term efficacy in clinical trials, but there are concerns about its long-term safety and efficacy. While response rates are similar between ECT and ketamine in clinical trials, these treatments have never been compared head-to-head in a sufficiently large, well-powered randomized study. Here we describe the study protocol for ELEctroconvulsive therapy (ECT) vs. Ketamine in patients with Treatment-resistant Depression (ELEKT-D), a non-inferiority, comparative effectiveness trial. Patients with TRD seeking clinical treatment are randomized (1:1) to receive ECT (thrice weekly) or intravenous ketamine (twice weekly) for 3-5 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders in each group at the end of study visit, as measured by a patient-reported outcome measure (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report). The study is powered such that the non-inferiority margin allows for ketamine to retain 90% of the ECT treatment effect, with a projected sample size of 400 patients (200 per group). Secondary outcomes include remission rates, depression severity, cognitive functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and tolerability. The results of the ELEKT-D study will have important implications for patient choice, clinical practice, and health insurance policies."

The Global Drug Survey is an online survey that aimed to explore the experience of people who use drugs in general population. This survey is conducted annually between November and December. This special Covid-19 component was conducted over seven weeks, from May to June 2020. The objective of the survey was to retrospectively explore the impact of confinement and the first weeks after lockdown on the consumption of psychoactive products in the general population. The results of the survey show an increase in the number of drinking days, but no increase in binge drinking. For cannabis, use remained relatively stable, although a relative increase compared to other countries was observed. The trends of ecstasy and cocaine uses in particular declined. Finally, benzodiazepines have seen their use increase. The Global Drug Survey notes that the pandemic has changed the patterns of use of psychoactive products, without an increase in deregulated behaviours being observed. People who use drugs have adapted their practices in line with changes in their social environment."

This essay describes the founding of the Heffter Research Institute in 1993 and its development up to the present. The Institute is the only scientific research organization dedicated to scientific research into the medical value of psychedelics, and it has particularly focused on the use of psilocybin. The first clinical treatment study was of the value of psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder. Next was a UCLA study of psilocybin to treat end-of-life distress in end-stage cancer patients. While that study was ongoing, a trial was started at Johns Hopkins University (JHU) to study the efficacy of psilocybin in treating anxiety and depression resulting from a cancer diagnosis. Following the successful completion of the UCLA project, a larger study was started at New York University, which is near completion. A pilot study of the value of psilocybin in treating alcoholism at the University of New Mexico also is nearing completion, with a larger two-site study being planned. Other studies underway involve the use of psilocybin in a smoking cessation program and a study of the effects of psilocybin in long-term meditators, both at JHU. The institute is now planning for a Phase 3 clinical trial of psilocybin to treat distress in end-stage cancer patients."
"8187","1","Psychedelics and Hallucinogens in Psychiatry: Finding New Pharmacological Targets.^
BACKGROUND: The therapeutic options for neurobehavioral disorders are still limited, and in many cases, they lack a satisfactory balance between efficacy and side effects. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to review current evidence regarding the potential contribution of psychedelics and hallucinogens to the discovery of new drugs for treating different psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: Ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin have evidence supporting their use in depression, and psilocybin and ayahuasca have also shown good results in treatment-resistant depression. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with anxious patients, there were symptomatic improvements with psilocybin and LSD. Psilocybin diminished Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in a small obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) sample. The evidence is less robust regarding substance use disorders, but it suggests a possible role for LSD and psilocybin in alcohol use disorders and for psilocybin in tobacco addiction. In a clinical setting, these substances seem to be safe and well-tolerated. Their mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, but there seems to be a preponderant role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 2A agonism, as well as connectivity changes within the default mode network (DMN) and amygdala and some other molecular modifications. CONCLUSION: The studies underlying the conclusions have small samples and are heterogeneous in their methods. However, the results suggest that the use of psychedelics and hallucinogens could be considered in some disorders. More studies are needed to reinforce their evidence as potential new drugs."
"4670","1","Expert opinion on psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for people with psychopathological psychotic experiences and psychotic disorders.^
Currently, individuals with personal or familial histories of psychopathological experiences of psychosis, psychotic spectrum disorders, bipolar disorder, and similar conditions are excluded from most psychedelic clinical trials, studies, and treatment programs. This study sought to determine why such an exclusion exists, what the implications of the exclusion criteria are, and if there was agreement in expert opinion. In-depth interviews with 12 experts in the fields of psychiatry, clinical psychology, medicine, and the effects of psychedelics were conducted in an expert consultation format. Interviews were transcribed, and themes were produced using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach. We found that while the exclusion criteria may be justified for psychedelic protocols that provide minimal psychological support for participants, experts agreed that psychedelic-, ketamine-, and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy are not necessarily contraindicated for all individuals within this group. Rather, results suggest that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy as well as therapy with MDMA and ketamine, which include high levels of support, may be of benefit to some individuals experiencing said conditions and symptoms. Potentially relevant factors for predicting treatment outcomes include specific symptom endorsement, illness duration, symptom severity, quality of therapeutic alliance, role of trauma in symptom etiology and perpetuation, and the level of other supports in the client’s life. An analysis of expert opinions revealed that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can potentially benefit people with psychopathological psychosis and psychotic conditions under the right conditions. However, more research needs to be carried out to determine the risks and develop a protocol specific to this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7365","1","Cortical oxygenation suggests increased effort during cognitive inhibition in ecstasy polydrug users.^
BACKGROUND: It is understood that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) causes serotonin dysfunction and deficits in executive functioning. When investigating executive function, functional neuroimaging allows the physiological changes underlying these deficits to be investigated. The present study investigated behavioural and brain indices of inhibition in ecstasy-polydrug users. METHODS: Twenty ecstasy-polydrug users and 20 drug-naïve participants completed an inhibitory control task (Random Letter Generation (RLG)) while prefrontal haemodynamic response was assessed using functional near infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS). RESULTS: There were no group differences on background measures including sleep quality and mood state. There were also no behavioural differences between the two groups. However, ecstasy-polydrug users displayed significant increases in oxygenated haemoglobin (oxy-Hb) from baseline compared to controls at several voxels relating to areas of the inferior right medial prefrontal cortex, as well the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Regression analysis revealed that recency of ecstasy use was a significant predictor of oxy-Hb increase at two voxels over the right hemisphere after controlling for alcohol and cannabis use indices. CONCLUSION: Ecstasy-polydrug users show increased neuronal activation in the prefrontal cortex compared to non-users. This is taken to be compensatory activation/recruitment of additional resources to attain similar performance levels on the task, which may be reversible with prolonged abstinence."

The lack of utter efficacy and fast action of commonly used antidepressants that selectively target the monoaminergic neurotransmission has led to the exploration of ketamine's actions. Ketamine's antidepressant effect was firstly described in 1973 and nowadays its therapeutic value as a fast- and long- lasting antidepressant has been extensively established. Ketamine is an antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and its main mechanism of action via NMDAR inhibition expressed in GABAergic (gamma-Aminobutyric acid, GABA) interneurons may be relayed to its antidepressant effects. This review aims to describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ketamine when used for treatment-resistant depression. Moreover, ketamine is a racemic mixture consisting of two enantiomers, R- and S- ketamine. We describe the pharmacology of esketamine, along with the guidelines for effective and safe intranasal administration of esketamine. Lastly, this review presents sex differences in preclinical and clinical studies of ketamine and esketamine administration."

RATIONALE: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a psychotropic substance found in various plant and animal species and is synthetically produced. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is used in naturalistic settings for spiritual exploration, recreation, or to address negative affect and mood problems. However, scientific knowledge on the effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to assess the effects of inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine on neuroendocrine markers. The second objective was to assess effects of the substance on affect and mindfulness. In addition, we assessed whether ratings of subjective measures were associated with changes in stress biomarkers (i.e., cortisol) and immune response (i.e., IL-6, CRP, IL-1β), as well as the acute psychedelic experience. METHODS: Assessments (baseline, immediately post-session, and 7-day follow-up) were made in 11 participants. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and post-session and analyzed by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased IL-6 concentrations in saliva immediately post-session. These changes were not correlated to ratings of mental health or the psychedelic experience. Relative to baseline, ratings of non-judgment significantly increased, and ratings of depression decreased immediately post-session and at follow-up. Ratings of anxiety and stress decreased from baseline to 7-day follow-up. Participant ratings of the psychedelic experience correlated negatively with ratings of affect and positively with ratings of non-judgment. CONCLUSION: Inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced significant changes in inflammatory markers, improved affect, and non-judgment in volunteers. Future research should examine the effect of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamineamine with healthy volunteers in a controlled laboratory setting."
"9235","1","Effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal control of behaviour in humans.^
Hallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation."

Objective: N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist antidepressants have known potential for abuse liability. The aim of this study was to evaluate the abuse liability of D-cycloserine (DCS), using a self-administration paradigm in which DCS was tested for its efficacy in substituting for ketamine in ketamine-dependent rats. Methods: A standard intravenous self-administration study was conducted in male adult Sprague-Dawley rats to study abuse liability. Potential for self-administration was assessed in ketamine-habituated subjects. Subjects were trained to press a lever to obtain food, prior to connection of the lever to the intravenous drug administration apparatus. DCS was provided for self-infusion by test subjects at doses of 1.5, 5.0, and 15 mg/kg per lever press. Results: S-ketamine was seen to substitute for ketamine and to result in self-administration at the same frequency. DCS was not seen to result in self-administration at any of the test doses. The self-infusion behavior of DCS was similar to control (saline). Conclusion: D-cycloserine, a partial agonist of the NMDAR glycine site, which has been shown to have antidepressant and anti-suicidal properties in clinical studies, has no apparent potential for abuse liability in a standard rodent self-administration model.

OBJECTIVES: Illicit drugs such as MDMA and methamphetamine are commonly abused drugs that have also been observed to be prevalent in drivers injured in road accidents. Their exact effect on driving and driving behavior has yet to be thoroughly investigated. METHODS: Sixty-one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample, with 33 females and 28 males, mean age 25.45 years. The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA, 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine, or a matching placebo. The drug administration was counter-balanced, double-blind, and medically supervised. At each session driving performance was assessed 3 h and 24 h post drug administration on a computerized driving simulator. RESULTS: At peak concentration overall impairment scores for driving (F(2,118)=9.042, p<0.001) and signaling (F(2,118)=4.060, p=0.020) were significantly different for the daytime simulations. Performance in the MDMA condition was worse than both the methamphetamine (p=0.023) and placebo (p<0.001) conditions and the methamphetamine condition was also observed to be worse in comparison to the placebo (p=0.055). For signaling adherence, poorer signaling adherence occurred in both the methamphetamine (p=0.006) and MDMA (p=0.017) conditions in comparison to placebo in the daytime simulations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study have for the first time illustrated how both MDMA and methamphetamine effect driving performance, and provide support for legislation regarding testing for the presence of illicit drugs in impaired or injured drivers as deterrents for driving under the influence of illicit drugs."
"5207","1","Psilocybin-induced changes in brain network integrity and segregation correlate with plasma psilocin level and psychedelic experience.^
The emerging novel therapeutic psilocybin produces psychedelic effects via engagement of cerebral serotonergic targets by psilocin (active metabolite). The serotonin 2A receptor critically mediates these effects by altering distributed neural processes that manifest as increased entropy, reduced functional connectivity (FC) within discrete brain networks (i.e., reduced integrity) and increased FC between networks (i.e., reduced segregation). Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive peroral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magneticresonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying profound perceptual experiences evoked by this emerging transnosological therapeutic and implicate the expression of network integrity and segregation in the psychedelic experience and consciousness.

Two retrospective epidemiologic studies have shown that cannabis is the main psychoactive substance detected in the blood of drivers suspected of driving under the influence of psychotropic drugs. An oral administration double-blind crossover study was carried out with eight healthy male subjects, aged 22 to 30 years, all occasional cannabis smokers. Three treatments and one placebo were administered to all participants at a two week interval: 20 mg dronabinol, 16.5 mg D9-tétrahydrocannabinol (THC) and 45.7 mg THC as a cannabis milk decoction. Participants were asked to report the subjective drug effects and their willingness to drive under various circumstances on a visual analog scale. Clinical observations, a psychomotor test and a tracking test on a driving simulator were also carried out. Compared to cannabis smoking, THC, 11-OH-THC and THC-COOH blood concentrations remained low through the whole study (<13.1 ng THC/mL,<24.7 ng 11-OH-THC/mL and<99.9 ng THC-COOH/mL). Two subjects experienced deep anxiety symptoms suggesting that this unwanted side-effect may occur when driving under the influence of cannabis or when driving and smoking a joint. No clear association could be found between these adverse reactions and a susceptibility gene to propensity to anxiety and psychotic symptoms (genetic polymorphism of the catechol-O-methyltransferase). The questionnaires have shown that the willingness to drive was lower when the drivers were assigned an insignificant task and was higher when the mission was of crucial importance. The subjects were aware of the effects of cannabis and their performances on the road sign and tracking test were greatly impaired, especially after ingestion of the strongest dose. The Cannabis Influence Factor (CIF) which relies on the molar ratio of active and inactive cannabinoids in blood provided a good estimate of the fitness to drive."

BACKGROUND: Garcinia kola (GK) has been experimentally tested for its potential usefulness against oxidative stress-related disorders in a number of body tissues, as well as a number of pathogenic and parasitic diseases. Studies investigating GK extracts' usefulness in combating nervous tissue toxicity, neuroinflammatory disorders, and neuronal degeneration are still inadequate and not yet conclusive. PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-induced neuroinflammation on the pyramidal neurons and astrocytes of the cornu ammonis 1 (CA1) region of the hippocampus and the role of GK extract (GKE) in attenuating the effects in the rat model. METHODS: The study was carried out by using 60 healthy adult male Wistar rats, which were randomly assigned into six groups, A, B, C, D, E, and F (n = 10)-A (control), B (100 mg/kg body weight of GKE only), C (200 mg/kg body weight of GKE only), D (20 mg/kg body weight of MDMA only), E (100 mg/kg body weight of GKE and 20 mg/kg body weight of MDMA), and F (200 mg/kg body weight of GKE and 20 mg/kg body weight of MDMA). Treatment was given for 21 days. Following 24 hours after the last administration, five rats in each group were anesthetized with diether and perfused intracardially, and the brains were excised and fixed in 10 percent neutral buffered formalin for the histological hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) and immunohistochemical glial fibrillary acidic proteins (GFAP). A thin-slice coronal section of the brain was obtained at the level of the optic chiasma and processed via the paraffin-embedding method. Also, the remaining five brains were used to assess neurotransmitter levels (serotonin and dopamine) and cytochrome c-oxidase. The statistical analysis was done using a one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA). RESULTS: A significant reduction (P < .05) in body weight was observed in the group that was administered with MDMA when compared with the control and the rest of the treated groups. Dopamine and serotonin levels were significantly decreased (P < .05) in the MDMA-only group when compared with the control and the rest of the treated groups. The control group and groups B, C, and F showed intact pyramidal neurons, unlike group D, which showed vacuolated and degenerating neurons. The expressions of vacuolation and degeneration in group D were less than those in group E, which received a low dose of GKE and MDMA.Hippocampal astrocytic expressions were significantly higher (P > .05) in the MDMA-only group when compared with the control and other groups. CONCLUSION: GKE has significant neuroprotective potential against MDMA-induced toxicity in brain tissue. This is evident in its prevention of MDMA-induced oxidative stress, pyramidal neuronal vacuolation, dispersion, and reactive astrogliosis in the CA1 region of the hippocampus. Our findings are dose-dependent, with 200 mg/kg of the extract being novel. We, however, recommend further study into the mechanism of action of GKE, on how it attenuates the astrocytic reaction caused by MDMA exposure."
"5339","0","Ketamine for pain management in France, an observational survey.^
CONTEXT: Before updating the French guidelines on postoperative pain treatment in 2015, the Pain Committee of the French Society of Anaesthesiology and Intensive Care (SFAR) conducted a survey on the medical use of ketamine in France. METHODS: An online questionnaire was nationally distributed to members of SFAR, the French Pain Society (SFETD) and the French Society of Emergency Medicine (SFMU). The questionnaire included questions on demographic data, the type of patients for whom ketamine was prescribed, the doses used, the side effects and safety measures associated with the administration of ketamine. RESULTS: A total of 1388 questionnaires were analysed. Ninety-two percent of the responders declared that they used ketamine. Ketamine was widely used as anti-hyperalgesic medication but the modalities of administration and the doses varied greatly and were not in accordance with the guidelines. Despite the lack of evidence and guidelines, ketamine has also been used to treat acute and chronic pain. Doses, duration and localization of the patients during administration have varied greatly. Psychedelic effects and hallucinations are the most feared side effects. In terms of monitoring during ketamine infusion, 15% of physicians declared that no monitoring was necessary while 59%, 55%, 59% and 77% monitored heart rate, SpO2, blood pressure and level of consciousness, respectively. CONCLUSION: Anaesthesiologists have integrated the benefit of ketamine in preventing hyperalgesia but there is no consensus on doses and duration. For other indications (acute and chronic pain treatment), toxicity and the absence of significant benefit call for guidelines from scientific societies."
"2102","1","Direct comparison of the acute subjective, emotional, autonomic, and endocrine effects of MDMA, methylphenidate, and modafinil in healthy subjects.^
RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects. METHODS: We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI). RESULTS: All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA induced subjective, emotional, sexual, and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used."

BackgroundKetamine has recently become an agent of interest as an acute treatment for severe depression and as the anaesthetic for electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Subanaesthetic doses result in an acute reduction in depression severity while evidence is equivocal for this antidepressant effect with anaesthetic or adjuvant doses.

"6762","1","Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy)-related myocardial hypertrophy: An autopsy study.^
Background: Myocardial hypertrophy is a well-recognized complication of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse and is a strong, independent risk factor for sudden death, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. We sought to determine if use of MDMA (methylenedioxyamphetamine or ""ecstasy"") is associated with myocardial hypertrophy at death. Methods and results: A matched, retrospective study using medical examiner (ME) death reports. Consecutive MDMA positive (+) and MDMA negative (-) deaths identified from MEs in 10 states and a local county, respectively. Five MDMA(-) cases were matched to each MDMA(+) case for age, sex, and ethnicity. MDMA(+) cases were confirmed using GC/MS and other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) were absent. Matched MDMA(-) cases were trauma fatalities with intact hearts and blood negative for all illicit stimulants. Cardiac weights were compared between the two groups. Twenty seven MDMA(+) deaths and 135 matched MDMA(-) deaths were enrolled. Mean age was 20 years (range 16-33 years); 44% were female. 70.4% were Caucasian, 14.8% African-American, 11.1% Asian, and 3.7% Hispanic. Mean heart weight of MDMA(+) fatalities was 315.7 and 277.2 g for MDMA(-) fatalities (Diff = 38.5 g; 95% CI = 18.3-8.7). Multivariate analysis revealed that MDMA(+) fatalities were more likely to have an enlarged heart (OR = 18.3; 95% CI = 3.6-1.6). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that MDMA users might also be at risk for myocardial hypertrophy and possible cardiac toxicity, similar to other stimulants. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"6158","1","Comparative Acute Effects of LSD, Psilocybin and Mescaline.^
LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (the active substance in ""magic mushrooms"") and mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) are serotonergic hallucinogens widely used for recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD, psilocybin and mescaline are thought to induce prototypical psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5‐HT2A receptor. However, there are differences in their molecular structures (LSD: ergoline, psilocybin: tryptamine; mescaline: phenethylamine)and receptor activation profiles which may induce different subjective effects. To date, there are no modern studies comparing these three substances directly within the same clinical study and research subjects using validated psychometric tools. Therefore, the LPM‐Study compares the acute effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and placebo in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 4‐period cross‐over design with four treatment conditions: 1) 100 μg LSD, 2) 20 mg psilocybin, 3) 300 mg mescaline, and 4) placebo. The main objective of this study is to determine whether LSD, psilocybin and mescaline produce qualitatively similar subjective alterations of mind and associated brain activity patterns despite their unique receptor activation profiles. The study investigates psychological (psychometry), physiological and neuronal (magnetic resonance imaging) variables. The LPM‐Study provides insight into the acute effects profiles of three serotonergic hallucinogens. It will enhance the understanding of psychedelic‐induced altered states of consciousness in humans and will be relevant for the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and forensic toxicology."

This study explores concurrent and criterion validity of a Continuous Performance Test, the Immediate and Delayed Memory Tasks (IMT/DMT). Concurrent validity was examined through comparison with collateral measures of impulsivity, while criterion validity was assessed by comparison of groups with differing levels of impulsive behavior, those with and without disruptive behavior disorders (DBD). DBDs in the DSM-IV include conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, which are both largely characterized by impulsive behaviors. We compared group performance on the IMT/DMT and several collateral measures of impulsivity between adolescent controls (n = 22) and psychiatric inpatients with a DBD diagnosis (n = 22). Data collected indicated that (1) DBD patients emitted more commission errors; (2) commission errors, but not correct detections, were significantly correlated with collateral measures of impulsivity, and (3) in posthoc comparisons, those DBD patients with histories of physical fighting emitted the greatest number of commission errors, followed by DBD nonfighters, and then controls. Similar group performance differences were observed for collateral impulsivity measures. This study supports the use of commission error rates on the Immediate and Delayed Memory Tasks...

"1600","1","Development of ketamine administration as a treatment for chronic PTSD.^
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a highly prevalent, chronic, and disabling condition for which currently available pharmacotherapies are insufficiently effective. Ketamine, which is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has emerged as a promising and rapid-acting novel treatment intervention for this disorder. Findings from a proof-of-concept, randomized, controlled cross-over study of single-dose intravenous ketamine administration (compared to single-dose midazolam) in patients with chronic PTSD suggest that ketamine is associated with rapid improvement in core PTSD symptoms and comorbid depressive symptoms, and is generally well tolerated. Additional research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for patients with PTSD. Results from ongoing trials of repeated intravenous administration for PTSD are expected to yield more definitive evidence. Potential mechanisms of action as well as future research directions are discussed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5409","0","Targeting the glutamatergic system to treat major depressive disorder: rationale and progress to date.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe, debilitating medical illness that affects millions of individuals worldwide. The young age of onset and chronicity of the disorder has a significant impact on the long-term disability that affected individuals face. Most existing treatments have focused on the 'monoamine hypothesis' for rational design of compounds. However, patients continue to experience low remission rates, residual subsyndromal symptoms, relapses and overall functional impairment. In this context, growing evidence suggests that the glutamatergic system is uniquely central to the neurobiology and treatment of MDD. Here, we review data supporting the involvement of the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of MDD, and discuss the efficacy of glutamatergic agents as novel therapeutics. Preliminary clinical evidence has been promising, particularly with regard to the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine as a 'proof-of-concept' agent. The review also highlights potential molecular and inflammatory mechanisms that may contribute to the rapid antidepressant response seen with ketamine. Because existing pharmacological treatments for MDD are often insufficient for many patients, the next generation of treatments needs to be more effective, rapid acting and better tolerated than currently available medications. There is extant evidence that the glutamatergic system holds considerable promise for developing the next generation of novel and mechanistically distinct agents for the treatment of MDD."

INTERVENTION: This is a study of safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of a single ascending dose of FT‐104 HCl in healthy volunteers. It is cohort designed with up to 6 cohorts of eight participants, where 6 will receive FT‐104 HCl and two will receive placebo as a sub‐cutaneous injection in the upper arm in the Clinical Research Unit. The dose escalation decisions between cohorts will be managed by a Safety Review Committee. Eligibility will be assessed during a screening period of up to 28 days prior to dosing. For the treatment period, subjects will be admitted to the clinical research unit (CRU) one day prior to the dosing (Day ‐1). Randomisation will occur on the morning of dosing (Day 1). On Day 1, all subjects will receive the assigned subcutaneous dose of FT‐104 HCl or placebo. Participants will be discharged from the clinic on Day 2 ( 24 hours post‐dose) after all required study procedures are completed and if deemed medically fit. Subjects will return to the clinic on Day 10 (± 2 days) for a follow up visit. Up to 6 cohorts may be enrolled in the study. Four (4) single doses are planned to be tested in 4 cohorts (Cohort 1 to Cohort 4) of up to 8 healthy volunteers (up to 6 active and 2 placebo). Two (2) additional ascending dose levels (Cohort 5 and Cohort 6), each consisting of up to 8 subjects (up to 6 active and 2 placebo), may be added based on emerging safety, tolerability, and PK data. The following dose levels are planned for the study: • Cohort 1: 5.5 mg FT‐104 HCl or placebo • Cohort 2: 11 mg FT‐104 HCl or placebo • Cohort 3: 22 mg FT‐104 HCl or placebo • Cohort 4: 33 mg FT‐104 HCl or placebo • Cohorts 5 and 6 may be added based on emerging safety, tolerability and PK data.

"5274","1","A randomized controlled trial of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and fear extinction retention in healthy adults.^
BACKGROUND: Fear conditioning and extinction are well-characterized cross-species models of fear-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and recent animal data suggest that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances fear extinction retention. AIMS: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. METHODS: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24 hours later, and 2 hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48 hours after extinction training. Participants (N = 34; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (χ(2) = 7.29, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention, the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention.Clinical Trials Registry Name and Identifier: Evaluation of MDMA on Startle Response (NCT0318176) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03181763?term = MDMA&draw = 2&rank = 9."
"1329","1","Long-term effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on the human central nervous system revealed by visual evoked potentials.^
Several studies indicate long-term cognitive impairment of MDMA (ecstasy) users. In the present study we attempted to establish whether electrophysiological correlates of low-level cognitive processes present a long-term alteration, dependent on the level of use of ecstasy. We addressed this issue by investigating amplitude and latency of VEPs related to a very simple discrimination task involving sustained attention (arousal). Eight heavy-MDMA users, eight moderate-MDMA users and 18 drug-free control subjects were asked to discriminate whether the digit at the centre of the screen was 1 or 2. None of the subjects (except one) had used MDMA in the 6 months previous testing. We measured psychophysical performance and EEG, recorded in Oz and Fz during task execution. The heavy-MDMA users made significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < .05). Moreover, they presented reduced amplitude but not latency of VEPs in both Oz and Fz. The effect in Oz is present in P200 (for heavy users only, p < . 05) and in P300 components (for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p < .001, moderate users: p < .0.5). In Fz, the amplitude effect is present in N250 (for heavy users only, p < .05) and in P300 components (for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p < .05, moderate users: p < .05). The three groups do not differ in early components, reflecting low-level processing. These results provide evidence of long-term electrophysiological abnormality displayed by ecstasy users and agree with the suggestion that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause long-term altered conical activity in humans. © Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs."
"6085","1","Ibogaine in the Treatment of Alcoholism: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Escalating-dose, Phase 2 Trial.^
Approximately 5% of the world's adult population has some alcohol‐related disorder, which in addition is associated with 3% of all deaths in the world. In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12 alcoholic patients. Each patient will be hospitalized for 20 days and receive 3 increasing doses of ibogaine. The first 3 patients will receive oral doses of 20 to 400 mg of ibogaine in an open‐label design. If the 3 higher doses (240, 320 and 400 mg) are well tolerated, the next 9 volunteers will receive these doses or placebo randomly. The volunteers will also be evaluated 7, 14 and 21 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after leaving the hospital to monitor the consumption of alcohol and other drugs."
"2675","1","Effectiveness and safety of perioperative ketamine on postoperative pain after elective total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia: preliminary results.^
Background and aims: Aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness and safety of perioperative intravenous infusion of ketamine in patients scheduled for elective unilateral Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) under spinal anesthesia. Methods: Midazolam 0.02 mg/kg was administered to all patients as premedication. Patients were randomly allocated in one of the following groups: Ketamine group and Control group. All patients received spinal anesthesia. Both groups received systemic i.v. analgesia with morphine 0.15 mg/kg plus ketoprophene 300 mg by elastomeric infusion pump at the rate of 2 ml/h for 24 h. The planned rescue analgesia was i.v. boluses of 2 mg of Morphine in order to obtain a VAS score ≤3. All patients received paracetamol every 6 h and, after systemic morphine discontinuation, oxycodone 5 mg SR 1 tablet every 12 h. In the Ketamine group a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg of ketamine was given to the patients before the start of operation then an infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h was maintained until the end of the operation. In all patients the level of sedation and any appearance of unpleasant psychotomimetic manifestations were recorded using Ramsay Sedation Scale during the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain score was evaluated using VAS scale at rest and during mobilization at 2‐4‐8‐12‐24‐48‐72 h after surgery. Rescue morphine requirement as well as incidences of adverse events were recorded at the same postoperative intervals. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction were investigated in both groups. Results: Seventeen eligible patients completed the study protocol from April to June 2011. A significant reduction in post‐operative pain score at rest and during patient mobilization, was observed in Ketamine group (P < 0.05), especially after 72 h (P < 0.01). No patients experienced psychotomimetic adverse effects (Ramsay Sedation Scale 2). Opioid requirement was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group (P < 0.05). LOS was significantly shorter in Ketamine group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Preliminary results showed that, in the multimodal analgesic regime, the perioperative administration of i.v. sub‐anesthetic doses of ketamine provides opioid‐sparing effects, improves the quality of postoperative analgesia and accelerates patient recovery after THA surgery."
"3192","1","6.3 CURRENT RESEARCH ON PSILOCYBIN TREATMENT ON END-OF-LIFE ANXIETY AND MDMA TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.^
Objectives: Over the past 15 years, funding and implementation of research projects exploring the range of effects and therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs have notably increased. This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters. With the psilocybin investigation, statistically significant reductions in anxiety were identified at various points over the 6‐month follow‐up period, along with a notable reduction in depression scores at the 6‐month data point. The MDMA study demonstrated a drug effect size of 1.4 for reduction of social anxiety. Conclusions: Both the psilocybin and MDMA studies demonstrated trends toward therapeutic efficacy, with amelioration of identified target symptoms. Each of these pilot investigations succeeded in obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, requisite funding, and outcome measures consistent with therapeutic outcome. Both studies support further clinical explorations of the treatment potential of these novel psychoactive compounds. AD, ASD, PPC"
"8162","0","Cannabis Use in Older Adults: A Perspective.^
The prevalence of cannabis use among older adults (aged 65 and above) for both recreational and medicinal purposes has significantly increased in recent years. Information regarding the safety of cannabis in this population is important since aging is associated with metabolic changes, multiple morbidities, increases in prescription medication use, and an overall decline in functioning. In this Perspectives article, we review special considerations pertinent to older adults-specifically, the impact of cannabis on cognition and on falls and injuries, its drug interactions, and its potential medicinal applications for treating the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia. Knowledge about the role of cannabis in brain health, injury risk, and drug interactions remains limited since the available evidence stems primarily from adolescent and young adult cohorts, plus a limited number of small observational studies with older adults. In terms of utilizing certain cannabinoids to treat the behavioral and psychological symptoms of dementia, some studies have found promising results, but because of the lack of consistency in the literature, it is premature to draw conclusions. Controlled research trials specifically with geriatric participants are needed to understand the effects of cannabis use in this vulnerable population."
"3605","1","Ketamine-Induced Modulation of the Thalamo-Cortical Network in Healthy Volunteers As a Model for Schizophrenia.^
BACKGROUND: Schizophrenia has been associated with disturbances of thalamic functioning. In light of recent evidence suggesting a significant impact of the glutamatergic system on key symptoms of schizophrenia, we assessed whether modulation of the glutamatergic system via blockage of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-receptor might lead to changes of thalamic functional connectivity. METHODS: Based on the ketamine model of psychosis, we investigated changes in cortico-thalamic functional connectivity by intravenous ketamine challenge during a 55-minute resting-state scan. Thirty healthy volunteers were measured with pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover design. RESULTS: Functional connectivity analysis revealed significant ketamine-specific changes within the thalamus hub network, more precisely, an increase of cortico-thalamic connectivity of the somatosensory and temporal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that changes of thalamic functioning as described for schizophrenia can be partly mimicked by NMDA-receptor blockage. This adds substantial knowledge about the neurobiological mechanisms underlying the profound changes of perception and behavior during the application of NMDA-receptor antagonists."
"6676","0","Mephedrone effects on acute alcohol intoxication.^
Objective: Mephedrone (4‐methylmethcathinone) is a synthetic cathinone derivative which displays similar effects to 4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), or amphetamines. Mephedrone is frequently consumed in combination with alcohol. This interaction in humans has not been previously investigated. The aim of this study was to evaluate the interactions between mephedrone and alcohol in humans. Method: Twelve healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants participated as outpatients in four experimental sessions. They received a single oral dose of mephedrone (200 mg) and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone placebo and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone (200 mg) and placebo alcohol, and both placebos. Design was double‐blind, double‐dummy, randomized, cross‐over and controlled with placebo. Study variables included: vital signs, subjective effects and some test of psychomotor performance. Results: The combination produced an increase in cardiovascular effects of mephedrone and induced more intense feeling of euphoria and well‐being in comparison to mephedrone and alcohol. Mephedrone reduced the drunkenness and sedation and the increase of the reaction time effects produced by alcohol. Conclusions: Mephedrone reduces the feeling of intoxication induced by alcohol, but alcohol increased the cardiovascular effects of mephedrone. The combination seems to have more liability to abuse. The results presented are similar to those obtained with the combination of alcohol with other psychostimulants."
"7472","1","Understanding pathways to stimulant use: a mixed-methods examination of the individual, social and cultural factors shaping illicit stimulant use across Europe (ATTUNE): study protocol.^
INTRODUCTION: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) including amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine/'ecstasy', methamphetamine, synthetic cathinones and 'Ritalin' are the second most commonly used illicit drugs globally. Yet, there is little evidence on which factors are associated with the development of different patterns of ATS use over the life course. This study aims to examine which individual, social and environmental factors shape different pathways and trajectories of ATS consumption. The study will be conducted in five European countries: Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic and the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a sequential mixed-methods study design to investigate the multiple factors (familial, social and occupational situation, critical life events, general risk behaviour, mental and physical health, satisfaction with life) that shape individual ATS use pathways. A systematic literature review will be performed to provide an overview of the current academic literature on the topic. In module 1, qualitative semistructured interviews (n=ATS users and non-users) will be conducted to explore individual experiences of, and perspectives on, dynamics of change in stimulant consumption patterns. In module 2, structured questionnaires (n=2000 ATS users and non-users) will be administered via tablet computers to validate and enhance the generalisability of the interview findings. Data integration will take place at two key points. First, during the study, where the findings from the first qualitative interviews will inform the design of the structured questionnaire. Second, at the end of the study, where mixed methods data will be brought together to generate an in-depth, contextualised understanding of the research topic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the respective responsible ethics committee in each participating country. Data will be treated confidentially to ensure participants' anonymity. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, national and international conferences, and in briefings for policy and practice."
"3548","1","Effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on memory and conscious awareness in healthy volunteers.^
Investigated the effects of ketamine on memory and related subjective states of awareness. The aim was to determine whether ketamine reproduces the selective impairment of autonoetic awareness observed in schizophrenia, and if it alters encoding or retrieval of information. 26 Ss (19–25 yrs old) were given either a 60-min ketamine or a placebo infusion. Ss carried out episodic memory tasks involving words presented before and during infusion. Memory performance was assessed with recognition and free recall tasks. Subjective states of awareness were assessed using an experiential approach. Levels of psychopathology were evaluated with the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). Ketamine impaired performance in free recall and recognition of words presented during, but not before, infusion. There were no differences between groups concerning states of awareness associated with recognition memory. Ss under ketamine had higher BPRS total scores as well as BPRS negative and positive cluster scores than control Ss. Results suggest that ketamine decreases episodic memory performance by impairing encoding, but not retrieval processes. It does not selectively impair subjective states of awareness associated with recognition memory as it has been seen in patients with schizophrenia.

"4358","1","A direct comparison of the behavioral and physiological effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans.^
RATIONALE: Despite their chemical similarities, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produce differing neurochemical and behavioral responses in animals. In humans, individual studies of methamphetamine and MDMA indicate that the drugs engender overlapping and divergent effects; there are only limited data comparing the two drugs in the same individuals. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA using a within-subject design. METHODS: Eleven adult volunteers completed this 13-day residential laboratory study, which consisted of four 3-day blocks of sessions. On the first day of each block, participants received oral methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), MDMA (100 mg), or placebo. Drug plasma concentrations, cardiovascular, subjective, and cognitive/psychomotor performance effects were assessed before drug administration and after. Food intake and sleep were also assessed. On subsequent days of each block, placebo was administered and residual effects were assessed. RESULTS: Acutely, both drugs increased cardiovascular measures and ""positive"" subjective effects and decreased food intake. In addition, when asked to identify each drug, participants had difficulty distinguishing between the amphetamines. The drugs also produced divergent effects: methamphetamine improved performance and disrupted sleep, while MDMA increased ""negative"" subjective-effect ratings. Few residual drug effects were noted for either drug. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the differences observed could explain the differential public perception and abuse potential associated with these amphetamines. Alternatively, the route of administration by which the drugs are used recreationally might account for the many of the effects attributed to these drugs (i.e., MDMA is primarily used orally, whereas methamphetamine is used by routes associated with higher abuse potential)."
"1752","1","Epidemiology of adolescent Salvia divinorum use in Canada.^
Background: Salvia divinorum is a potent, naturally occurring hallucinogen gaining popularity as a recreational drug in North America. To date, detailed epidemiologic information about the use of this substance among adolescents living outside the United States has been limited. This study provides information on the prevalence and correlates of Salvia divinorum use among adolesecents in Canada using a nationally representative sample. Methods: Data were obtained from a representative sample of 42,179 Canadian adolescents aged 12-17 years living across all 10 provinces who completed the Youth Smoking Survey in 2008-09. Results: Overall, 3.8% of adolescents reported using Salvia in the past year and 6.2% had used the substance in their lifetime. A conservative estimate suggests 23.2% of youth were repeat users. Salvia use was highest among youth in British Columbia and Quebec. Comparatively, the prevalence of 12-month Salvia use was higher than 12-month cocaine and amphetamine use but lower than 12-month ecstasy, cannabis, and other hallucinogen use. Correlates of Salvia use included older age, male gender, high available spending money, binge drinking, illicit drug use and smoking in fully adjusted models. Findings suggest low self-esteem may be an important correlate specific to the use of this substance among youth. Conclusions: Salvia divinorum use is prevalent among Canadian adolescents. Salvia may be a significant public health issue in Canada given it is readily available, under limited regulation, and little is known about the abuse liability of the substance, interactions with other substances, and potential complications from use. © 2012 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
"5046","1","Effects of intra-operative administration of subanesthetic s-ketamine on emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is administered in the perioperative period for its benefits in analgesia, anti-agitation and anti-depression when administered at a small dose. However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026). EEG patterns did not differ during the recovery period after emergence between groups. CONCLUSION: Ketamine administered during sevoflurane anesthesia had no apparent influence on emergence time in young and middle-aged female patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Subanesthetic s-ketamine induced an active prefrontal EEG pattern during sevoflurane anesthesia but did not raise neurological side effects after surgery.

"2582","1","Polysubstance use profiles among electronic dance music party attendees in New York City and their relation to use of new psychoactive substances.^
Background Electronic Dance Music (EDM) party attendees are often polysubstance users and are at high risk for use of new psychoactive substances (NPS). We sought to identify patterns of use of common illegal drugs among EDM party attendees, sociodemographic correlates, and use of NPS as a function of patterns of use of more common drugs to inform prevention and harm reduction. Method Using time-space-sampling, 1045 individuals aged 18–40 were surveyed entering EDM parties in New York City. We queried past-year use of common illegal drugs and 98 NPS. We conducted latent class analysis to identify polysubstance use profiles of use of eight common drugs (i.e., ecstasy, ketamine, LSD, mushrooms, powder cocaine, marijuana, amphetamine, benzodiazepines). Relationships between drug classification membership and sociodemographics and use of drugs within six NPS categories were examined. Results We identified four profiles of use of common drugs: non-polysubstance use (61.1%), extensive polysubstance use (19.2%), moderate polysubstance use/stimulants (12.8%), and moderate polysubstance use/psychedelics (6.7%). Those in the moderate/psychedelic group were at higher odds of using NPS with psychedelic-type effects (2C, tryptamines, and other “new” psychedelics; Ps < 0.05). Extensive polysubstance users were at increased odds of reporting use of 2C drugs, synthetic cathinones (“bath salts”), tryptamines, other new (non-phenethylamine) psychedelics, new dissociatives, and synthetic cannabinoids (Ps < 0.05). Conclusion NPS preference is linked to the profile of use of common drugs among individuals in the EDM scene. Most participants were identified as non-polysubstance users, but findings may help inform preventive and harm reduction interventions among those at risk in this scene."
"7928","1","Ecstasy (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use among Japanese rave population.^
Aims The aim of this study was to examine the prevalence of 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use and to identify characteristics of MDMA users among rave attendees in Japan. This is the first rave-population study focusing on MDMA use in Japan. Methods The anonymous self-administrative questionnaire was conducted using laptop computers at four rave parties at three different venues in Tokyo, Japan. Participants were asked about lifetime use of MDMA and other club drug use, characteristics of rave attendance, and their demographics. Results Questionnaires were completed by 300 rave attendees (47.3% female), 68.3% of whom were aged 20-29 years, and 92.3% of whom had completed high school. Among the participants, 8.0% reported MDMA use. Compared with 'non-drug controls' (the participants who had never used any illicit drugs), MDMA users were significantly more likely to be 30-39-year-old men. In addition, compared with 'cannabis users' (non-MDMA users who had used cannabis), MDMA users were significantly more likely to use other drugs and reported more adverse health effects due to 'polydrug use'. Furthermore, MDMA users were significantly more likely to go to raves and preferred smaller venues. Conclusions Our results clearly suggest that rave attendees have a higher lifetime prevalence of MDMA use than the Japanese general population (0.2% reported in 2007). MDMA users are deeply involved in rave parties, and MDMA use may have high potential to generate close relationships among rave attendees. Therefore, MDMA users may have more opportunities to access MDMA than cannabis users and non-drug controls. © 2013 The Authors.

"6717","1","Ecstasy (MDMA) effects upon mood and cognition: Before, during and after a Saturday night dance.^
Three groups of young people (aged 19-30 years) were compared: 15 regular ecstasy users who had taken MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) on ten or more occasions; 15 novice ecstasy users who had taken MDMA on fewer than ten previous occasions; and 15 controls who had never taken MDMA. Each subject completed a cognitive test and mood scale battery four times: an initial drug-free baseline, at a Saturday night dance/club (on-drug), then 2 days later, and 7 days later. On the Saturday night, regular ecstasy users took an average of 1.80 MDMA tablets, novice users took 1.45 MDMA tablets, while controls mostly drank alcohol. The consumption of cannabis and cocaine at the club was similar across groups; All three groups reported positive moods at the dance club (on-drug), although there were borderline trends (P < 0.10) for less sadness/depression in the MDMA subgroups. However 2 days afterwards, the ecstasy users felt significantly more depressed, abnormal, unsociable, unpleasant, and less good tempered, than the controls. Cognitive performance on both tasks (verbal recall, visual scanning) was significantly reduced on-MDMA. Memory recall was also significantly impaired in drug-free MDMA users, with regular ecstasy users displaying the worst memory scores at every test session. This agrees with previous findings of memory impairments in drug-free ecstasy users. Animal data have shown that MDMA can generate long-term serotonergic neurodegereration in various brain areas, including the hippocampus. The cognitive deficits in drug-free recreational ecstasy users, suggest that MDMA may also be neurotoxic in humans."
"9036","1","Information processing speed in ecstasy (MDMA) users.^
Previous research draws parallels between ecstasy-related and age-related deficits in cognitive functioning. Age-related impairments in working memory have been attributed to a slow down in information processing speed. The present study compared 29 current ecstasy users, 10 previous users and 46 non-users on two tests measuring information processing speed and a computation span task measuring working memory. Results showed that ecstasy users performed worse than non-ecstasy users in the letter comparison task although the overall difference was not significant (p = 0.089). Results from the pattern recognition task showed that current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < 0.01). When results were combined for both the letter and pattern tasks, once again current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than non-ecstasy users (p < 0.01). Working memory deficits obtained were statistically significant with both ecstasy using groups performing significantly worse than non-users on the computation span measure (p < 0.01). Moreover, ANCOVA with measures of processing speed as covariates failed to eliminate the group difference in computation span (p < 0.01). Therefore, it is likely the mechanism responsible for impairments in the computation span measure is not the same as that in elderly adults where processing speed generally removes most of the age-related variance. Also of relevance is the fact that the ecstasy users reported here had used a range of other drugs making it difficult to unambiguously attribute the results obtained to ecstasy use.

BACKGROUND: Impairments in social functioning are a common feature of psychiatric disorders. Game paradigms pose a unique way for studying how people make decisions in interpersonal contexts. In the last decade, researchers have started to use these paradigms to study social decision-making in patients with psychiatric disorders. PURPOSE: The aim of this systematic literature review is to summarise the currently available evidence on the behaviour of patients with psychiatric disorders in the commonly used Ultimatum Game (UG). METHOD: A systematic literature search including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PSYNDEXplus Tests, PSYNDEXPLUS Literature, EBM Reviews-Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Embase and PASCAL was performed via the Ovid interface. RESULTS: We found evidence for alterations in UG behaviour for patients with frontotemporal dementia, schizophrenia, affective disorders, alcohol, cocaine, heroin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine consumption, alcohol dependence, anxiety disorders, borderline personality disorder, autism, Tourette syndrome and oppositional defiant disorder. CONCLUSION: There is some evidence that different psychiatric disorders might go along with alterations in social decision-making. However, in general, data are currently limited and studies are hard to compare due to differences in methodologies."
"6024","0","Combined Ketamine/Propofol for Emergency Department Procedural Sedation.^
Introduction Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are used for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in Emergency Departments, including propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, and others, but propofol has gained popularity despite its potential to cause cardiac and respiratory depression. Obviously the optimal agent or combination of agents has not been identified. There are reasons to believe that a combination of ketamine and propofol may have advantages over other agents/combinations. These include better hemodynamic stability at equal depth of anesthesia with a combination of ketamine/propofol than with propofol alone, less respiratory depression with the combination in comparison to propofol alone, and preservation of respiratory drive with the combination. There is one study of ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or combinations. We designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare propofol to propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in Emergency Department procedural sedation and analgesia. Our hypothesis was that the combination of propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory depression than propofol alone. Methods Study design We conducted a randomized, prospective, double‐blinded study of all patients receiving procedural sedation. From May 2007 until March 2009 in the ED of a 274 bed university teaching hospital. The study was approved by the University of Missouri's Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Study setting and population All patients requiring PSA in the ED were viewed as potential subjects unless they were pregnant, less than 1 year of age, history of prior adverse reaction to anesthesia, underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic dysfunction, porphyria, psychiatric illness, allergy to eggs/soybeans, increased intracranial or intraocular pressure, abnormal airway pathology or an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or greater. The attending ED physician would then approach the patient to enroll them in the study. If the patient accepted they were randomized by the hospital pharmacy. Study protocol An ED attending physician was dedicated to PSA throughout the procedure. Patients had EKG, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end‐tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) monitored, had IV access obtained and were placed on nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. All patients received pre‐procedure analgesia with 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/Kg of fentanyl and all patients had reflective sunglasses placed so as to obscure eye movements from the staff. Subjects were randomized by the pharmacy in blocks of ten. Consecutively numbered pre‐filled 3cc syringes were prepared by the pharmacy staff once they received a signed and dated study enrollment sheet from the ER staff with the patients weight in kilograms provided. All physicians, nurses, patients and study personnel were blinded to the contents of the syringes which were hand delivered by pharmacy personnel. The quantity of all drugs delivered were recorded. During the procedure all patients were monitored for 5 respiratory depression markers: ‐ PetCO2 rise of ³ 5 mm/Hg ‐ Respiratory rate < 8 br/min ‐ arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) < 90% ‐ Apnea ³ 15 seconds ‐ Airway manipulation Physicians were permitted to intervene and provide any supportive/resuscitative measures at there discretion despite the pre‐specified respiratory depression markers. 1. Not satisfied 2. Somewhat satisfied 3. Satisfied Patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/Kg of ketamine or placebo (normal saline) delivered to the emergency room sedating physician in a 3 cc syringe containing a clear/colorless solution. This solution was delivered intravenously over a one minute infusion. On completion of this infusion all patients received propofol start ng at 1 mg/Kg over 2 minutes and supplemented with repeated boluses of 0.5 mg/Kg to maintain adequate sedation. Patients were felt to be adequately sedated once they received a Colorado Behavioral Numerical Pain Scale (CBNPS) score of 0 to 113(table 1.) Patients were monitored after the procedure until a normal level of consciousness was observed. All data were collected and recorded on standardized Hospital PSA forms. Data was collected for the entire time frame of the individual procedural sedations. Following the completion of the procedural sedation a second form was filled out by both the sedating physician and monitoring nurse recording specifically any respiratory events/rescue interventions and overall satisfaction with the procedural sedation. The overall quality of the PSA was evaluated by the physician/nurse performing the sedation as one of the following: 4. Very satisfied 5. Excellent All data was recorded on a secure computer in spreadsheet form (Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for later analysis. Outcome Measures Four endpoints were defined prior to study initiation: Respiratory Depression. A difference in evidence of respiratory depression between the groups. Respiratory depression was defined as the occurrence of any of the 5 markers. Satisfaction with PSA. A difference in the evaluation of the quality of the sedation by the providers. Quality of PSA. Number of patients with a CBNPS of 0. Propofol usage. Did the addition of ketamine significantly reduce the amount of propofol needed to produce adequate PSA. Data analysis We plan to enroll 100 patients in each group. This is based on an estimate of a 40% incidence of respiratory depression with propofol alone, a reduction to 20% with the combination of ketamine/propofol, an a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.14‐16. An interim analysis was conducted at enrollment of 100 patients using a significance of 0.025 for difference in respiratory depression. Respiratory depression and CBNPS were compared using a chi‐squared test and Satisfaction with PSA and Quality of PSA were compared using a t‐test. Tests were done with Primer of Biostatistics (Version 6.0, Stanton A. Glantz, 2005)."
"5572","1","Effects of Ayahuasca on Personality: Results of Two Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials in Healthy Volunteers.^
Rationale: Previous studies with the serotonergic hallucinogens LSD and psilocybin showed that these drugs induced changes in personality traits, such as increases in Openness. However, results are inconsistent, and the effects of ayahuasca on personality were never investigated in a controlled trial. Objectives: To assess the effects of ayahuasca on personality in two randomized, placebo-controlled trials in healthy volunteers. Methods: Data from two parallel-group, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in healthy volunteers were included. In the first trial, 15 volunteers ingested ayahuasca or placebo, while in the second trial 15 volunteers received placebo+ayahuasca or cannabidiol (CBD)+ayahuasca. Personality was assessed with the NEO-Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) at baseline and 21 days post-treatment. Results: There were significant differences between groups in baseline Openness scores, but not on day 21. A significant increase in Openness scores was observed in the placebo + ayahuasca group in study 2. No other within-group differences were observed for any other domain. Conclusions: Ayahuasca produced inconsistent effects on personality since it induced significant increase in Openness 21 days post-drug intake only in one of the trials. The absence of significant differences in the other ayahuasca groups could be due to small sample sizes and baseline differences among groups. The effects of ayahuasca and other serotonergic hallucinogens on personality should be further investigated in clinical samples."

A high performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (HPLC-HRMS) method for simultaneous screening and quantification of 28 drugs was developed and validated for 2.5mg hair samples. Target drugs and their metabolites included amphetamines, cocaine, opioids, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, and hallucinogens. After decontamination, hair samples were extracted with 200μL of a mixture of water: acetonitrile:1M trifluoroacetic acid (80:10:10, v/v) using a 5min simultaneous pulverization/extraction step. The extracts were analysed by HPLC-HRMS in an Orbitrap at a nominal resolution of 60,000, with concomitant in source collisional experiments (in source CID). Gradient elution on an Atlantis T3 column resolved 28 target compounds and 5 internal standards. Total chromatographic run time was 26min. Calibration was achieved by linear regression analysis utilizing six calibration points; R2 ranged from 0.9964 to 0.9999, the limits of quantification were 0.1ng/mg for 8 compounds, 0.2ng/mg for 16 compounds and 0.5ng/mg for 4 compounds; mean relative errors from -21% to +23% were obtained; relative standard deviation, used to estimate repeatability and intermediate reproducibility at three concentrations, was always less than 20%. Process efficiency and recoveries for all analytes were better than 65 and 73%, respectively, at any concentration. The method was applied to hair samples from forensic investigations that contained a broad assortment of drugs of abuse and pharmaceuticals. The use of concomitant HRMS full scan and CID afforded the possibility of retrospective analysis for discovering untargeted drugs. © 2011."

METHODS: Thirty-three students completed a single-arm study ostensibly examining how a psychedelic drug affects creativity. The 4-h study took place in a group setting with music, paintings, coloured lights, and visual projections. Participants consumed a placebo that we described as a drug resembling psilocybin, which is found in psychedelic mushrooms. To boost expectations, confederates subtly acted out the stated effects of the drug and participants were led to believe that there was no placebo control group. The participants later completed the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, which measures changes in conscious experience. RESULTS: There was considerable individual variation in the placebo effects; many participants reported no changes while others showed effects with magnitudes typically associated with moderate or high doses of psilocybin. In addition, the majority (61%) of participants verbally reported some effect of the drug. Several stated that they saw the paintings on the walls ""move"" or ""reshape"" themselves, others felt ""heavy… as if gravity [had] a stronger hold"", and one had a ""come down"" before another ""wave"" hit her. CONCLUSION: Understanding how context and expectations promote psychedelic-like effects, even without the drug, will help researchers to isolate drug effects and clinicians to maximise their therapeutic potential."

Severe and enduring eating disorders (EDs) have the highest mortality rate of all psychiatric illnesses (Arch Gen Psychiatry, 2011, 68, 724), especially when comorbid with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (Psychiatr Res, 2016, 244, 45). We report on four patients with enduring EDs and TRD treated with repeat ketamine over 12 + months, showing improvement in depression with only modest changes in ED symptoms."
"8494","1","Party people: Personality and MDMA use of house party visitors.^
Personality characteristics have been linked to substance use, however research on the association between personality and MDMA use is scarce. This study examined differences on Big Five personality dimensions between a population sample of non-hard drug using Dutch adolescents and young adults (n = 265), and a sample of young people visiting house parties, including both MDMA- and non-MDMA-users (n = 541). Results showed that 71% of the party visitors indicated using MDMA. Group differences were found on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism-emotional stability, but not on resourcefulness-openness to experience. Compared to the non-hard drug using National respondents, MDMA-using party visitors reported higher levels of extraversion and both MDMA and non-MDMA-using partygoers showed less conscientiousness. Non-MDMA-using partygoers reported less agreeableness and emotional stability than National Sample respondents. MDMA-users actually high on the drug at the moment of administration of the questionnaire did not differ from their non-high counterparts on any of the personality dimensions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"5838","1","Acute Effects of Ketamine Infusion on Postoperative Mood Scores in Patients Undergoing Dilation and Curettage: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.^
BACKGROUND: Emotional and psychological effects following abortion are more common than physical side effects and can range from mild regret to more serious complications such as depression. In the last decade, it has been suggested that low dose of ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative ketamine infusion on postoperative mood score in patients undergoing Dilation and Curettage (D&C) under spinal anesthesia. We hypothesized that a single low-dose administration of ketamine infusion during D&C surgery can improve mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study included a total of 60 patients, ≥18 years, physical status ASA II, with up to 12-week gestation undergoing elective D&C surgery. Patients were divided randomly into a ketamine group (group K) and a control group (group C). In group K, 0.4 mg/kg ketamine was given as a continuous infusion over 20 min intraoperatively. Main Outcome Measure. Profile of Mood States (POMS) was recorded preoperatively and 2 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no differences in preoperative POMS between the two groups. Mean postoperative POMS of group K was lower than that of group C indicating mood improvement. Ketamine group patients showed higher sedation score and increased, although self-limiting, psychedelic phenomena than the control group. CONCLUSION: Observed data here support an acute effect of ketamine on mood but any further claim will be speculative. Further future studies exploring postoperative mood scores after 24 hours post-infusion are needed. This trial is registered with PACTR201907779292947."

AIMS: The mental health of youth is continually changing and requires reliable monitoring to ensure that adequate social and economic resources are allocated. This study assessed trends in mental health among Canadian youth, 12-24 years old. Specifically, we examined the prevalence of poor/fair perceived mental health, diagnosis of mood and anxiety disorders, suicidality, perceived stress and sleep problems, substance use, and mental health consultations. METHODS: Data were collected from eight cycles of the annual Canadian Community Health Survey (2011-2018). Prevalence of mental health outcomes was calculated from each survey, and meta-regression was used to assess trends over time. In the absence of a significant trend over time, the eight cycles were pooled together using meta-analysis techniques to gain precision. Trends in prevalence were assessed for the overall sample of youth (12-24 years) and separately for male and female adolescents (12-18 years) and young adults (19-24 years). RESULTS: The prevalence of poor/fair perceived mental health, diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders, and past-year mental health consultations increased from 2011 to 2018, most strongly among young adult females. Past-year suicidality increased among young adult females but did not change for other age and sex groups. Notably, the prevalence of binge drinking decreased by 2.4% per year for young adult males, 1.0% for young adult females and 0.7% per year for adolescent males, while staying relatively stable for adolescent females. Prevalence of cannabis use declined among adolescents before legalisation (2011-2017); however, this trend did not persist in 2018. Instead, the 2018 prevalence was 5.6% higher than the 2017 prevalence (16.3 v. 10.7%). The combined prevalence of other illicit drug use was stable at 4.6%; however, cocaine use and hallucinogens increased by approximately 0.2% per year. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings highlight a growing need for youth mental health services, as indicated by a rise in the prevalence of diagnosed mood and anxiety disorders and past-year mental health consultations. The reason for these observed increases is less apparent - it may represent a true rise in the prevalence of mental illness, or be an artefact of change in diagnostic practices, mental health literacy or diminishing stigma. Nonetheless, the findings indicate a need for the health care system to respond to the rising demand for mental health services among youth."
"3278","1","Psilocybin Therapy of Psychiatric Disorders Is Not Hampered by hERG Potassium Channel-Mediated Cardiotoxicity.^
Psilocybin, a hallucinogen contained in ""magic"" mushrooms, holds great promise for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, and early clinical trials are encouraging. Adverse cardiac events after intake of high doses of psilocybin and a trial reporting QT interval prolongation in the electrocardiogram attributed to the drug's main metabolite, psilocin, gave rise to safety concerns. Here we show that clinical concentrations of psilocin do not cause significant human ether-a-go-go-related gene (hERG) potassium channel inhibition, a major risk factor for adverse cardiac events. We conclude that hERG channel blockage by psilocin is not liable for psilocybin- associated cardiotoxic effects."
"3176","1","Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial.^
Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

"5464","1","Serotonin neurotoxicity after (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy""): a controlled study in humans.^
(+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy""), an increasingly popular recreational drug, is known to damage brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in experimental animals. Whether MDMA is neurotoxic in humans has not been established. Thirty MDMA users and 28 controls were admitted to a controlled inpatient setting for measurement of biologic and behavioral indexes of central 5-HT function. Outcome measures obtained after at least 2 weeks of drug abstinence included concentrations of monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), prolactin responses to L-tryptophan, nociceptive responses to ischemic pain, and personality characteristics in which 5-HT has been implicated (i.e., impulsivity and aggression). Subjects with a history of MDMA exposure had lower levels of CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the major metabolite of 5-HT) than controls (p = .001). Although they resembled controls in their prolactin response to L-tryptophan and their response to ischemic pain, MDMA users had lower scores on personality measures of impulsivity (p = .004) and indirect hostility (p = .009). The CSF findings suggest that 5-HT neurotoxicity may be a potential complication of MDMA use. Further, differences in personality support the view that 5-HT systems are involved in modulating impulsive and aggressive personality traits. Additional studies of MDMA-exposed individuals are needed to confirm and extend the present findings. Such studies could help elucidate the role of 5-HT in normal brain function as well as in neuropsychiatric disease states."
"4460","1","Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations.^
Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 μg/kg vs placebo) on both α oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital α power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced α power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of α oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."
"6891","1","Cognitive impairment after small-dose ketamine isomers in comparison to equianalgesic racemic ketamine in human volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is increasingly used in pain therapy but may impair brain functions. Mood and cognitive capacities were compared after equianalgesic small-dose S(+)-, R(-)-, and racemic ketamine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects received intravenous 0.5 mg/kg racemic, 0.25 mg/kg S(+)-, and 1.0 mg/kg R(-)-ketamine in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Hemodynamic variables, mood, and cognitive capacities were assessed for 60 min. RESULTS: Transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and catecholamines were similar after administration of all drugs. At 20 min after injection, subjects felt less decline in concentration and were more brave after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. They reported being less lethargic but more out-of-control after R(-)- than racemic ketamine. Ketamine isomers induced less drowsiness, less lethargy, and less impairment in clustered subjective cognitive capacity than racemic ketamine for the 60-min study. Objective concentration capacity [test time, S(+): 25.4 +/- 15.2 s, R(-): 34.8 +/- 18.4 s, racemic ketamine: 40.8 +/- 20.8 s, mean +/- SD] and retention in primary memory [test time, S(+): 4.6 +/- 1.2 s, R(-): 4.2 +/- 1.4 s, racemic ketamine: 4.0 +/- 1.4 s, mean +/- SD] declined less after S(+)- than either R(-)- or racemic ketamine at 1 min. At 5 min, immediate recall, anterograde amnesia, retention in primary memory, short-term storage capacity, and intelligence quotient were less reduced after the isomers than racemic ketamine. Speed reading and central information flow decreased less after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Early after injection, ketamine isomers induce less tiredness and cognitive impairment than equianalgesic small-dose racemic ketamine. In addition, S(+)-ketamine causes less decline in concentration capacity and primary memory. The differences in drug effects cannot be explained by stereoselective action on one given receptor."
"3933","0","Qualitative and quantitative EEG findings in schizophrenia.^
Various conflicting EEG observations are reported in adult schizophrenia, childhood schizophrenia, neuroleptic treatment, and use of hallucinogenic compounds. The most important finding in the research over the past 40 yrs is seen as the confirmation that patients with schizophrenia have more low-voltage, fast EEGs and less well-organized alpha activity than controls. Findings of excessive fast activity and nonalpha activity in schizophrenics, as confirmed by quantitative EEG analysis, have been disavowed for the most part. Recent work has indicated no relationship between fast EEG activity in schizophrenics and muscle potential; this was again shown in the author's work on neuroleptics. The author has found that children of schizophrenic parents differed from controls in EEG measurements as did psychotic and adult schizophrenics from their respective control groups. These patterns were characterized by less alpha wave activity, more high-frequency beta activity, and more very slow low-voltage delta waves. Evidence for the hypothesis that the desynchronized high-frequency beta activity may be the electrophysiological representation of the genetic predisposition to schizophrenia is presented. All drugs effective in schizophrenia (neuroleptics) produce effects on quantitative EEGs that are almost diametrically opposite to those seen in schizophrenia.

"1291","1","Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: a preliminary positron emission tomography study.^
BACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence support a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, rapidly improves depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 20 unmedicated participants with treatment-resistant MDD underwent positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and following ketamine infusion (single dose of .5mg/kg intravenous over 40minutes). Metabolic data were compared between conditions using a combination of region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses, and differences were correlated with the associated antidepressant response. RESULTS: Whole-brain metabolism did not change significantly following ketamine. Regional metabolism decreased significantly under ketamine in the habenula, insula, and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the right hemisphere. Metabolism increased postketamine in bilateral occipital, right sensorimotor, left parahippocampal, and left inferior parietal cortices. Improvement in depression ratings correlated directly with change in metabolism in right superior and middle temporal gyri. Conversely, clinical improvement correlated inversely with metabolic changes in right parahippocampal gyrus and temporoparietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these results indicate that treatment-resistant MDD subjects showed decreased metabolism in the right habenula and the extended medial and orbital prefrontal networks in association with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine. Conversely, metabolism increased in sensory association cortices, conceivably related to the illusory phenomena sometimes experienced with ketamine. Further studies are needed to elucidate how these functional anatomical changes relate to the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."
"2961","0","The emerging role of psilocybin and MDMA in the treatment of mental illness.^
INTRODUCTION: Mental illness has a chronic course of illness with a number of clinical manifestations. Affected individuals experience significant functional, emotional, cognitive, and/or behavioral impairments. The growing prevalence of mental illness has been associated with significant social and economic costs. Indeed, the economic burden of mental illness is estimated to exceed $1.8 trillion USD over the next 30 years. A significant number of individuals affected by mental illness fail to respond to first-line treatment options. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for rapidly attenuating therapeutic options for mental health disorders with minimal social and economic burden. AREAS COVERED: The paucity of novel treatment options warrants a renewed investigation of psychedelic-based psychotherapy. Herein, the authors will evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional psychedelics, psilocybin, and MDMA, in the treatment of mental illness with a narrative review of available literature. EXPERT OPINION: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and MDMA, offer an alternative avenue of therapy for many mental health disorders. Available evidence indicates that psychedelics may offer a single-dose, rapid effect model that have robust effects with treatment-resistant mental disorders and a unique advantage as a possible monotherapy for mental illness. Novel clinical trials that evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy in clinically representative populations are warranted."

Background: COVID-19 related stay-at-home (SAH) orders created many economic and social stressors, possibly increasing the risk of drug/alcohol abuse in the community and trauma population.Objectives: Describe changes in alcohol/drug use in traumatically injured patients after SAH orders in California and evaluate demographic or injury pattern changes in alcohol or drug-positive patients.Methods: A retrospective analysis of 11 trauma centers in Southern California (1/1/2020-6/30/2020) was performed. Blood alcohol concentration, urine toxicology results, demographics, and injury characteristics were collected. Patients were grouped based on injury date - before SAH (PRE-SAH), immediately after SAH (POST-SAH), and a historical comparison (3/19/2019-6/30/2019) (CONTROL) - and compared in separate analyses. Groups were compared using chi-square tests for categorical variables and Mann-Whitney U tests for continuous variables.Results: 20,448 trauma patients (13,634 male, 6,814 female) were identified across three time-periods. The POST-SAH group had higher rates of any drug (26.2% vs. 21.6% and 24.7%, OR = 1.26 and 1.08, p < .001 and p = .035), amphetamine (10.4% vs. 7.5% and 9.3%, OR = 1.43 and 1.14, p < .001 and p = .023), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) (13.8% vs. 11.0% and 11.4%, OR = 1.30 and 1.25, p < .001 and p < .001), and 3,4-methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) (0.8% vs. 0.4% and 0.2%, OR = 2.02 and 4.97, p = .003 and p < .001) positivity compared to PRE-SAH and CONTROL groups. Alcohol concentration and positivity were similar between groups (p > .05).Conclusion: This Southern California multicenter study demonstrated increased amphetamine, MDMA, and THC positivity in trauma patients after SAH, but no difference in alcohol positivity or blood concentration. Drug prevention strategies should continue to be adapted within and outside of hospitals during a pandemic."
"2483","1","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity."

According to a recent report from the Office of Suicide Prevention in the US Department of Veterans Affairs, veterans represent 8.5% of the US population, but account for 18% of all deaths from suicide. The aim of this study of psychiatric patients (n=39; 87% male) was to compare blood gene expression data from veterans with a history of one or more suicide attempts to veterans who had never attempted suicide. The attempter and non-attempter groups were matched for age and race/ethnicity, and both groups included veterans with a diverse psychiatric history that included posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and substance-use disorders. Veterans were interviewed for lifetime psychiatric history, including a detailed assessment of prior suicide attempts and provided a blood sample. Results of Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) identified several pathways associated with suicide attempts, including the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and WNT signaling pathways. These pathways are of particular interest, given their role in explaining pharmacological treatments for suicidal behavior, including the use of ketamine and lithium. These results suggest that findings observed in civilians are also relevant for veterans and provide a context for interpreting results observed in post-mortem samples. In conclusion, an emerging body of work that shows consistency in findings across blood and brain samples suggests that it might be possible to identify molecular predictors of suicide attempts."

IMPORTANCE: Novel treatments for opioid use disorder (OUD) are needed to address both the ongoing opioid epidemic and long-standing barriers to existing OUD treatments that target the endogenous μ-opioid receptor (MOR) system. The goal of this review is to highlight unique clinical trial design considerations for the study of emerging treatments for OUD that address targets beyond the MOR system. In November 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a meeting to discuss the current evidence regarding potential treatments for OUD, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, sedative-hypnotics, and immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines. OBSERVATIONS: Consensus recommendations are presented regarding the most critical elements of trial design for the evaluation of novel OUD treatments, such as: (1) stage of treatment that will be targeted (eg, seeking treatment, early abstinence/detoxification, long-term recovery); (2) role of treatment (adjunctive with or independent of existing OUD treatments); (3) primary outcomes informed by patient preferences that assess opioid use (including changes in patterns of use), treatment retention, and/or global functioning and quality of life; and (4) adverse events, including the potential for opioid-related relapse or overdose, especially if the patient is not simultaneously taking maintenance MOR agonist or antagonist medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying the recommendations provided here as well as considering input from people with lived experience in the design phase will accelerate the development, translation, and uptake of effective and safe therapeutics for individuals struggling with OUD."
"3725","0","Causes and consequences of the loss of serotonergic presynapses elicited by the consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') and its congeners.^
The massive and prolonged stimulation of serotonin (5-HT)-release and the increased dopaminergic activity are responsible for the acute psychomimetic and psychostimulatory effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') and its congeners. In vulnerable subjects, at high doses or repeated use, and under certain unfavorable conditions (crowding, high ambient temperature), severe, in some cases fatal, averse systemic reactions (hyperthermia, serotonin-syndrome) may occur during the first few hours. Animal experiments revealed the existence of similar differences in vulnerability and similar dose- and context-related influences on a similar sequence of acute responses. The severity of these acute systemic responses is closely related to the severity of the long-term damage to 5-HT axon terminals caused by the administration of substituted amphetamines. Attempts to identify the mechanisms involved in this selective degeneration of 5-HT presynapses brought to light a multitude of different factors and conditions which either attenuate or potentiate the loss of 5-HT terminals caused by MDMA and related amphetamine derivatives. These puzzling observations suggest that the degeneration of 5-HT presynapses represents only the final step in a sequence of events which compromize the ability of 5-HT terminals to maintain their functional and structural integrity. The common feature of all these events is a profound wastage of energy. Substituted amphetamines selectively tax energy metabolism in 5-HT presynapses through their ability to exchange with 5-HT and to dissipate transmembrane ion gradients. The active carrier systems in the vesicular and presynaptic membrane operate at a permanently activated state. The resulting energy deficit can no longer adequately restored by the 5-HT presynapses when their availability of substrates for ATP production is additionally reduced by the hyperthermic and other energy consuming reactions which are elicited by the systemic administration of substituted amphetamines. The exhaustion of energy in 5-HT nerve terminals compromizes all energy-requiring endogenous mechanisms involved in the regulation of transmembrane-ion exchange, internal Ca++-homeostasis, prevention of oxidative stress, detoxification, and repair. Above a critical threshold the failure of these self-protective mechanisms will lead to the degeneration of the 5-HT axon terminals. Based on the role of 5-HT as a global modulatory transmitter-system involved in the stabilization and integration of impulse flow between distributed multifocal neuronal networks, the partial loss of 5-HT presynapses must be expected to impair the ability of these networks to maintain the integrity of signal flow pattern, and increase the likelihood of switching to unstable information processing. Behavioral responding may therefore become more dominated by activities generated in individual networks, and hitherto 'buffered' personality traits and predisposition may become manifested as defined psychiatric syndromes in certain predisposed subjects."
"7225","1","Effects of Ketamine on Brain Activity During Emotional Processing: Differential Findings in Depressed Versus Healthy Control Participants.^
BACKGROUND: In the search for novel treatments for depression, ketamine has emerged as a unique agent with rapid antidepressant effects. Experimental tasks involving emotional processing can be used during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to investigate ketamine's effects on brain function in major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined ketamine's effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during an emotional processing task. METHODS: A total of 33 individuals with treatment-resistant MDD and 24 healthy control participants (HCs) took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants received ketamine and placebo infusions 2 weeks apart, and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted at baseline and 2 days after each infusion. Blood oxygen level-dependent signal was measured during an emotional processing task, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze differences in activation among group, drug, and task-specific factors. RESULTS: A group-by-drug interaction was observed in several brain regions, including a right frontal cluster extending into the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Participants with MDD had greater activity than HCs after placebo infusion but showed lower activity after ketamine infusion, which was similar to the activity in HCs after placebo. A group-by-drug-by-task condition interaction was also found, which showed further differences that varied between implicit and explicit emotional conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The main results indicate that ketamine had differential effects on brain activity in participants with MDD versus HCs. The pattern of activation in participants with MDD after ketamine infusion resembled the activation in HCs after placebo infusion, suggesting a normalization of function during emotional processing. The findings contribute to a better understanding of ketamine's actions in the brain."
"8374","0","Chronic ketamine exposure induces permanent impairment of brain functions in adolescent cynomolgus monkeys.^
Ketamine, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptor antagonist, has emerged as an increasingly popular drug among young drug abusers worldwide. Available evidence suggests that ketamine produces acute impairments of working, episodic and semantic memory along with psychotogenic and dissociative effects when a single dose is given to healthy volunteers. However, understanding of the possible chronic effects of ketamine on behavior, cognitive anomalies and neurochemical homeostasis is still incomplete. Although previous human studies demonstrate that ketamine could impair a range of cognitive skills, investigation using non-human models would permit more precise exploration of the neurochemical mechanisms which may underlie the detrimental effects. The current study examined the abnormalities in behavior (move, walk, jump and climb) and apoptosis of the prefrontal cortex using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated biotinylated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) and apoptotic markers, including Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 in adolescent male cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) after 1 or 6 months of sub-anesthetic ketamine administration (1 mg/kg, i.v.). Results showed that ketamine decreased locomotor activity and increased cell death in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys with 6 months of ketamine treatment when compared with the control monkeys. Such decreases were not found in the 1-month ketamine-treated group. Our study suggested that ketamine administration of recreational dose in monkeys might produce permanent and irreversible deficits in brain functions due to neurotoxic effects, involving the activation of apoptotic pathways in the prefrontal cortex."

Abstract Objectives The objective of this study is to describe the clinical use and safety profile of low-dose ketamine (LDK) (0.1-0.3 mg/kg) for pain management in the emergency department (ED). Methods This was a retrospective case series of consecutive patients given LDK for pain at a single urban ED between 2012 and 2013. Using a standardized data abstraction form, 2 physicians reviewed patient records to determine demographics, indication, dose, route, disposition, and occurrence of adverse events. Adverse events were categorized as minor (emesis, psychomimetic or dysphoric reaction, and transient hypoxia) and serious (apnea, laryngospasm, hypertensive emergency, and cardiac arrest). Additional parameters measured were heart rate and systolic blood pressure. Results Five hundred thirty patients received LDK in the ED over a 2-year period. Indications for LDK were diverse. Median patient age was 41 years, 55% were women, and 63% were discharged. Route of administration was intravenous in 93% and intramuscular in 7%. Most patients (92%) received a dose of 10 to 15 mg. Comorbid diseases included hypertension (26%), psychiatric disorder (12%), obstructive airway disease (11%), and coronary artery disease (4%). There was no significant change in heart rate or systolic blood pressure. Thirty patients (6%) met our criteria for adverse events. Eighteen patients (3.5%) experienced psychomimetic or dysphoric reactions. Seven patients (1.5%) developed transient hypoxia. Five patients (1%) had emesis. There were no cases of serious adverse events. Agreement between abstractors was almost perfect. Conclusion Use of LDK as an analgesic in a diverse ED patient population appears to be safe and feasible for the treatment of many types of pain."

Previous research has demonstrated the ability of non-active smoked cannabis cigarettes to induce subjective effects of intoxication (i.e., placebo effect). No studies have been conduced to test whether edible forms of cannabis, which are associated with a significant delay in onset of effect, are able to induce a placebo effect. In the present study, 20 participants were told that they would receive an edible cannabis lollipop containing a high dose of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), but were instead given a placebo control. Measures of intoxication and mood were taken at baseline, 30 minutes, and 60 minutes post-ingestion of the placebo lollipop. Results of four repeated-measures ANOVAs found significant and quadratic changes across time in cannabis (ARCI m-scale) intoxication (F(2,18) = 4.90, p = .01, η(2) = .22) and negative mood (F(2,18) = 3.99, p = .05, η(2) = .19). Changes in positive mood and the overall measure of general intoxication (ARCI) failed to reach significance. The present study provides preliminary evidence that a placebo effect can be induced with inert edible agents when participants are told that they are receiving active THC. This is the first known study to demonstrate an edible cannabis intoxication placebo effect."
"509","0","Concurrent and simultaneous polydrug use among young Swiss males: Use patterns and associations of number of substances used with health issues.^
Background: Simultaneous polydrug use (SPU) may represent a greater incremental risk factor for human health than concurrent polydrug use (CPU). However, few studies have examined these patterns of use in relation to health issues, particularly with regard to the number of drugs used. Methods: In the present study, we have analyzed data from a representative sample of 5734 young Swiss males from the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors. Exposure to drugs (i.e., alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and 15 other illicit drugs), as well as mental, social and physical factors, were studied through regression analysis. Results: We found that individuals engaging in CPU and SPU followed the known stages of drug use, involving initial experiences with licit drugs (e.g., alcohol and tobacco), followed by use of cannabis and then other illicit drugs. In this regard, two classes of illicit drugs were identified, including first uppers, hallucinogens and sniffed drugs; and then ""harder"" drugs (ketamine, heroin, and crystal meth), which were only consumed by polydrug users who were already taking numerous drugs. Moreover, we observed an association between the number of drugs used simultaneously and social issues (i.e., social consequences and aggressiveness). In fact, the more often the participants simultaneously used substances, the more likely they were to experience social problems. In contrast, we did not find any relationship between SPU and depression, anxiety, health consequences, or health. Conclusions: We identified some associations with SPU that were independent of CPU. Moreover, we found that the number of concurrently used drugs can be a strong factor associated with mental and physical health, although their simultaneous use may not significantly contribute to this association. Finally, the negative effects related to the use of one substance might be counteracted by the use of an additional substance. © 2014 by Walter de Gruyter Berlin/Boston."
"966","0","Driving on ice: impaired driving skills in current methamphetamine users.^
RATIONALE: Previous research indicates a complex link between methamphetamine (METH) and driving performance. Acute dosing with amphetamines has improved driving-related performance in some laboratory studies, while epidemiological studies suggest an association between METH use, impaired driving, and accident culpability. METHODS: Current METH users were compared to a control group of nonusers on driving simulator performance. Groups were matched for age, gender, and driving experience. Subjects were assessed for current drug use, drug dependence, and drug levels in saliva/blood as well as personality variables, sleepiness, and driving performance. RESULTS: METH users, most of whom met the criteria for METH dependence, were significantly more likely to speed and to weave from side to side when driving. They also left less distance between their vehicle and oncoming vehicles when making a right-hand turn. This risky driving was not associated with current blood levels of METH or its principal metabolite, amphetamine, which varied widely within the METH group. Other drugs were detected (principally low levels of THC or MDMA) in some METH users, but at levels that were unlikely to impair driving performance. There were higher levels of impulsivity and antisocial personality disorder in the METH-using cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm indications from epidemiological studies of an association between METH use and impaired driving ability and provide a platform for future research to further explore the factors contributing to increased accident risk in this population."
"9446","1","Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6."
"9297","1","An item response theory analysis of DSM-IV criteria for hallucinogen abuse and dependence in adolescents.^
Aim: This study applied both item response theory (IRT) and multiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) methods to evaluate item-level psychometric properties of diagnostic questions for hallucinogen use disorders (HUDs), differential item functioning (DIF), and predictors of latent HUD. Methods: Data were drawn from 2004-2006 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Analyses were based on 1548 past-year hallucinogen users aged 12-17 years. Substance use and symptoms were assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Results: Abuse and dependence criteria empirically were arrayed along a single continuum of severity. All abuse criteria indicated middle-to-high severity on the IRT-defined HUD continuum, while dependence criteria captured a wider range from the lowest (tolerance and time spent) to the highest (taking larger amounts and inability to cut down) severity levels. There was indication of DIF by hallucinogen users' age, gender, race/ethnicity, and ecstasy use status. Adjusting for DIF, ecstasy users (vs. non-ecstasy hallucinogen users), females (vs. males), and whites (vs. Hispanics) exhibited increased odds of HUD. Conclusions: Symptoms of hallucinogen abuse and dependence empirically do not reflect two discrete conditions in adolescents. Trends and problems related to hallucinogen use among girls and whites should be examined further to inform the designs of effective gender-appropriate and culturally sensitive prevention programs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd."

This study assesses medical students' use of and attitudes towards club drugs, classified as Generation I (i.e., cocaine and lysergic acid diethylamide), and Generation II (ie, methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA], ketamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate, methamphetamine, rohypnol, dextromethorphan) club drugs based on their initial widespread use in club settings. An anonymous questionnaire was administered to 340 medical students. The prevalence of any club drug use was 16.8%, with MDMA (11.8%) and cocaine (5.9%) the most commonly used. Results discussed also include the relationship of age and gender to having ever used club drugs and to their attitudes regarding use. Additionally, the study identifies differences in patterns of use and attitudes toward Generation I versus Generation II club drugs based on age, gender, and participants' prior club drug use. Findings are compared to those of earlier studies about medical students and those in a similar age group in the general population. © 2008 by The Haworth Press. All rights reserved."
"6605","1","Cell-mediated immune response in MDMA users after repeated dose administration: studies in controlled versus noncontrolled settings.^
Acute administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") produces time-dependent immune dysfunction in humans. Recreational use of MDMA generally includes repeated drug consumption, often in association with other drugs, such as alcohol and cannabis. In the laboratory setting, repeated MDMA administration to healthy MDMA consumers produced a time-dependent immune dysfunction similar to that observed with the ingestion of a single dose, and the first of the two administrations paralleled the time-course of MDMA-induced cortisol stimulation kinetics and MDMA plasma concentrations. A significant decrease in CD4 T-helper cells with simultaneous increase in natural killer (NK) cell and a decrease in functional responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogenic stimulation was observed. Response to the second dose was either long-lasting compared with the first dose or disproportionate and did not show any parallelism with cortisol and MDMA plasma concentrations. This circumstance extended the critical period during which immunocompetence is highly impaired as a result of MDMA use. Accumulation of MDMA in the body of a poor metabolizer induced higher immunomodulatory effects with statistically significant differences in NK cell function compared with extensive metabolizers. When basal values of lymphocyte subsets were examined in a population of recreational MDMA users participating in different clinical trials, alterations in several immunological parameters were observed. The absolute number of lymphocytes, in particular T lymphocytes and CD4 T-helper cell subsets, showed a trend toward reduced values, although cell counts were within normal limits. By contrast, NK cells in MDMA consumers were reduced to one-third of those from healthy persons. A statistically significant decrease in affected immune parameters was recorded during a 2-year observation period in a subgroup of recreational MDMA users. These permanent alterations in immunologic homeostasis may result in impairment of general health and subsequent increased susceptibility to infection and immune-related disorders."
"207","1","Detection of acute 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) effects across protocols using automated natural language processing.^
The detection of changes in mental states such as those caused by psychoactive drugs relies on clinical assessments that are inherently subjective. Automated speech analysis may represent a novel method to detect objective markers, which could help improve the characterization of these mental states. In this study, we employed computer-extracted speech features from multiple domains (acoustic, semantic, and psycholinguistic) to assess mental states after controlled administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and intranasal oxytocin. The training/validation set comprised within-participants data from 31 healthy adults who, over four sessions, were administered MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), oxytocin (20 IU), and placebo in randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants completed two 5-min speech tasks during peak drug effects. Analyses included group-level comparisons of drug conditions and estimation of classification at the individual level within this dataset and on two independent datasets. Promising classification results were obtained to detect drug conditions, achieving cross-validated accuracies of up to 87% in training/validation and 92% in the independent datasets, suggesting that the detected patterns of speech variability are associated with drug consumption. Specifically, we found that oxytocin seems to be mostly driven by changes in emotion and prosody, which are mainly captured by acoustic features. In contrast, mental states driven by MDMA consumption appear to manifest in multiple domains of speech. Furthermore, we find that the experimental task has an effect on the speech response within these mental states, which can be attributed to presence or absence of an interaction with another individual. These results represent a proof-of-concept application of the potential of speech to provide an objective measurement of mental states elicited during intoxication."

Rationale: Blocking is an associative learning process that is attenuated in schizophrenia, can be modulated by cue salience and is accompanied by changes in selective attention. Repeated exposure to ketamine can model aspects of schizophrenia, and frequent users selectively attend to images of the drug. Objectives: This study aimed to establish whether (1) ketamine users show attenuated blocking to reward-predicting cues and (2) drug cues can modulate blocking and cause overshadowing of neutral cues that are equally predictive of reward in these individuals. Methods: Ketamine users (n = 18) and polydrug controls (n = 16) were assessed on the Drug Cue Reward Prediction Error Task, which indexes blocking and overshadowing to neutral and drug-related cues following Pavlovian reward conditioning. Schizotypy, depression, drug history and ketamine dependence were also assessed. Results: Compared to controls, ketamine users showed elevated delusional, schizotypal and depressive symptoms, and a reduction in blocking as evidenced by higher accuracy to blocked cues. Drug-related cues were resistant to blocking and seen as more important for earning money by ketamine users compared to controls. Both groups showed overshadowing of neutral cues by drug cues, and ketamine users gave both of these cues higher importance ratings than controls. Conclusions: These findings provide the first evidence that (1) glutamatergic perturbation is linked to a reduction in blocking and (2) blocking can be modulated by the presence of drug-related cues. The ability of drug cues to bias selective learning about ‘alternative rewards’ has implications for contingency management based addiction treatments.

Objectives: To investigate oral health sensations (short term oral health effects) associated with illicit drug abuse. In addition, to identify variations in oral health sensations produced by different illicit drugs. Subject: Young adults in a drug rehabilitation programme in Hong Kong, China. Method: Self-completed questionnaire about their previous pattern of drug abuse and oral health sensations experienced (recalled). Results: All (119) subjects were poly-drug abusers (abused one or more illicit drugs in the past). Amphetamine-based drugs such as methamphetamine ('speed') and methylenedioxymethamphetine ('ecstasy') were commonly abused. A wide range of oral health sensations were reported on recall of their abuse of illicit drugs; most frequently dry mouth (95%, 113). Types of illicit drugs abused were associated with oral health sensations reported (P < 0.001). 'Ecstasy' abusers more frequently reported chewing (P < 0.001), grinding (P < 0.001), and TMJ tenderness (P < 0.001) compared to non-'ecstasy' abusers. Conclusion: Illicit drug abuse produces many oral health sensations. Types of drugs abused were associated with oral sensations produced, and behavioural effects that may manifest as depression, anxiety, memory loss and various neuropsychotic disorders.8,9 In some cases drug abuse can result in death by various means: malignant hyperthermia, internal bleeding, fatal overdosing and through allergic reactions.10,11 Likewise, there have been reports on the long term clinical effects of illicit drug abused on oral health, © British Dental Journal 2005."

BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and substance use disorders (SUD). METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of KAP and discussing mechanisms of action, identified on PubMed and PsycInfo. RESULTS: Five randomized-controlled trials reported on the efficacy of KAP treatment and discussed active mechanisms. Four of the studies treated adults with SUD and a single study treated adults with TRD. Overall, KAP had a significant positive effect on primary outcome measures compared to controls, however, the data is mixed. The study examining KAP for TRD found no benefit. LIMITATIONS: Lack of large, replicated clinical trials. No studies actively examining mechanisms of action. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that temporary neural changes caused by ketamine such as n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition and increase of synaptic neuroplasticity affect treatment outcomes of KAP. Based on reports of preliminary findings, we speculate that adjunct psychotherapy, changes in perspective, and spirituality may also play a role."
"3179","1","Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance.^
RATIONALE: Although psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its acute and persisting effects. OBJECTIVES: This double-blind study evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were hallucinogen-naïve adults reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40 mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design, six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions. Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers. CONCLUSIONS: When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous scientific investigations of their causes and consequences."
"3492","1","Nature-themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^
INTRODUCTION: Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Set and setting, particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature, may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes. But to date, randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic-assisted therapy are lacking. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Visual Healing, a nature-themed video intervention to optimize set and setting, versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open-label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD. For the first session, participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature-themed videos during the preparation session and the ""ascent"" and ""descent"" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session. For the second session 4 weeks later, participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use, psychedelic effects, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 (95%) randomized participants (mean age 49 ± 11 years, 60% female) completed the 14-week study. During the first psilocybin session, participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42-min video and there were no video-related adverse events. Peak increase in post-psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures. Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects, stress, and anxiety were similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In this open-label pilot study, viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated among participants with AUD. Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy, without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol-related treatment outcomes. Studies to replicate our findings as well as studies of different set and setting interventions with other psychedelic medications and indications are warranted."

"7273","0","Addition of a 5-HT receptor agonist to methylphenidate potentiates the reduction of [<SUP>123</SUP>I]FP-CIT binding to dopamine transporters in rat frontal cortex and hippocampus.^
The neurotoxic potential of amphetamine and related drugs is well documented. However, methylphenidate, an amphetamine derivative used in the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, and known to increase synaptic dopamine (DA) levels, seems to lack neurotoxic potential. It is hypothesized that both dopaminergic and serotonergic systems are involved in the neurotoxicity of amphetamine derivatives. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate the neurotoxic potential of methylphenidate and to test whether stimulation of the serotonergic system may confer neurotoxic properties to methylphenidate for DA or serotonin (5-HT) neurons. In addition, the present study was undertaken to evaluate the necessity to perform future SPECT studies in individuals using both methylphenidate and Ei-HT-acting agents. We therefore measured monoaminergic transporters in rat brain using radioligands suitable for SPECT imaging ([I-123]beta -CIT and [I-123]FP-CIT). Groups of rats were treated with methylphenidate or saline for 4 days. Additional groups were treated with the selective 5-HT2 receptor agonist quipazine or the selective 5-HT reuptake blocker fluoxetine, alone or in combination with methylphenidate. Binding studies were performed 5 days after the last treatment. In a second experiment, methylphenidate in combination with quipazine, along with a control group, was retested. In this experiment, monoaminergic terminal density was estimated 2 weeks (rather than 5 days) after drug treatment. Five days, but not 2 weeks, after treatment a significant reduction in specific [I-123]FP-CIT binding was observed in the frontal cortex and hippocampus of rats treated with methylphenidate in combination with quipazine. These changes probably do not reflect neurotoxic changes of frontal cortex and hippocampal DA terminal markers, but a compensatory downregulation of DA transporters. These findings suggest potential harmful effects of concomitant use of drugs directly activating 5-HT2 receptors in patients using methylphenidate. (C) 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc."
"3549","0","Depression, Mindfulness, and Psilocybin: Possible Complementary Effects of Mindfulness Meditation and Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression. A Review.^
Depression is a major public health problem that affects approximately 4.4% of the global population. Since conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are only partially effective, as demonstrated by the number of patients failing to achieve remission, alternative treatments are needed. Mindfulness meditation (MM) and psilocybin represent two promising novel treatments that might even have complementary therapeutic effects when combined. Since the current literature is limited to theoretical and empirical underpinnings of either treatment alone, the present review aimed to identify possible complementary effects that may be relevant to the treatment of depression. To that end, the individual effects of MM and psilocybin, and their underlying working mechanisms, were compared on a non-exhaustive selection of six prominent psychological and biological processes that are well known to show impairments in patients suffering from major depression disorder, that is mood, executive functioning, social skills, neuroplasticity, core neural networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological levels. Based on predefined search strings used in two online databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) 1129 articles were identified. After screening title and abstract for relevance related to the question, 82 articles were retained and 11 were added after reference list search, resulting in 93 articles included in the review. Findings show that MM and psilocybin exert similar effects on mood, social skills, and neuroplasticity; different effects were found on executive functioning, neural core networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmune system markers. Potential mechanisms of MM's effects are enhanced affective self-regulation through mental strategies, optimization of stress reactivity, and structural and functional adjustments of prefrontal and limbic areas; psilocybin's effects might be established via attenuation of cognitive associations through deep personal insights, cognitive disinhibition, and global neural network disintegration. It is suggested that, when used in combination, MM and psilocybin could exert complementary effects by potentiating or prolonging mutual positive effects, for example, MM potentially facilitating psilocybin-induced peak experiences. Future placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trials focusing on psilocybin-assisted mindfulness-based therapy will provide knowledge about whether the proposed combination of therapies maximizes their efficacy in the treatment of depression or depressive symptomatology."
"4508","1","Psilocybin-Induced Decrease in Amygdala Reactivity Correlates with Enhanced Positive Mood in Healthy Volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: The amygdala is a key structure in serotonergic emotion-processing circuits. In healthy volunteers, acute administration of the serotonin 1A/2A/2C receptor agonist psilocybin reduces neural responses to negative stimuli and induces mood changes toward positive states. However, it is little-known whether psilocybin reduces amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli and whether any change in amygdala reactivity is related to mood change. METHODS: This study assessed the effects of acute administration of the hallucinogen psilocybin (.16 mg/kg) versus placebo on amygdala reactivity to negative stimuli in 25 healthy volunteers using blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging. Mood changes were assessed using the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule and the state portion of the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. A double-blind, randomized, cross-over design was used with volunteers counterbalanced to receive psilocybin and placebo in two separate sessions at least 14 days apart. RESULTS: Amygdala reactivity to negative and neutral stimuli was lower after psilocybin administration than after placebo administration. The psilocybin-induced attenuation of right amygdala reactivity in response to negative stimuli was related to the psilocybin-induced increase in positive mood state. CONCLUSIONS: These results demonstrate that acute treatment with psilocybin decreased amygdala reactivity during emotion processing and that this was associated with an increase of positive mood in healthy volunteers. These findings may be relevant to the normalization of amygdala hyperactivity and negative mood states in patients with major depression."
"3789","0","[Contribution of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptor to antidepressant effect of serotonergic psychedelics].^
Major depressive disorder presents a substantial global health burden, and at least 30-40% of patients exhibit treatment resistance to antidepressants. Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is used as an anesthetic agent. In 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved esketamine (the S-enantiomer of ketamine) as a therapeutic agent for treatment-resistant depression; however, this drug has reportedly been associated with serious side effects such as dissociative symptoms, thus limiting its clinical use as an antidepressant. Recently, various clinical studies have reported that psilocybin, the psychoactive substance found in magic mushrooms, has a fast-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effect in patients with major depressive disorder, including those resistant to conventional treatment. Furthermore, psilocybin is a psychoactive drug that is relatively harmless compared to ketamine and other similar substances. Accordingly, the FDA has designated psilocybin as a ""breakthrough therapy approach"" for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Additionally, serotonergic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide show some potential in the treatment of depression, anxiety, and addiction. The increased attention the use of psychedelics has attracted as a psychiatric disorder treatment approach is referred to as the ""psychedelic renaissance"". Pharmacologically, psychedelics cause hallucinations by stimulating cortical serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors (5-HT2A), although whether 5-HT2A is responsible for the manifestation of their therapeutic effects remains unclear. Furthermore, it is unclear whether the hallucinations and ""mystical experience"" that the patients go through because of 5-HT2A activation by psychedelics is essential for the therapeutic effect of these substances. Future research should elucidate the molecular and neural mechanisms underlying the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. This review summarizes the therapeutic effects of psychedelics on psychiatric disorders such as major depressive disorder in clinical and pre-clinical studies, and discusses the possibility of 5-HT2A as a novel therapeutic target."

"5456","1","Altered pain responses in abstinent (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") users.^
RATIONALE: (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a popular recreational drug that has potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in humans. Brain 5-HT neurons play a role in pain modulation, yet little is known about long-term effects of MDMA on pain function. Notably, MDMA users have been shown to have altered sleep, a phenomenon that can lead to altered pain modulation. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess pain processing in MDMA users using objective methods, and explore potential relationships between pain processing and sleep indices. METHODS: Forty-two abstinent MDMA users and 43 age-matched controls participated in a 5-day inpatient study. Outcome measures included standardized measures of pain, sleep polysomnograms, and power spectral measures of the sleep EEG. When differences in psychophysiological measures of pain were found, the relationship between pain and sleep measures was explored. RESULTS: MDMA users demonstrated lower pressure pain thresholds, increased cold pain ratings, increased pain ratings during testing of diffuse noxious inhibitory control, and decreased Stage 2 sleep. Numerous significant relationships between sleep and pain measures were identified, but differences in sleep between the two groups were not found to mediate altered pain perception in MDMA users. CONCLUSIONS: Abstinent MDMA users have altered pain perception and sleep architecture. Although pain and sleep outcomes were related, differences in sleep architecture in MDMA users did not mediate altered pain responses. It remains to be determined whether alterations in pain perception in MDMA users are secondary to neurotoxicity of 5-HT-mediated pain pathways or alterations in other brain processes that modulate pain perception."
"7223","1","Pretreatment functional neuroimaging correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine.^
Background: In major depressive disorder (MDD) there are multiple treatment options, each of which may be effective for some patients but not for others. Predicting whether a specific treatment will be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms for a particular patient is difficult, and identifying measurable biological markers, or biomarkers, that could be assessed in individuals to help identify an effective treatment would be valuable. Previous research has used neuroimaging measures at baseline to test for potential correlations with treatment response in depression. Neural biomarkers of response may be challenging to identify for most pharmacological treatments for MDD, due to the length of time it takes for many antidepressants to show effects (potentially several weeks). The rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, make this compound well‐suited for investigating biomarkers that correlate with treatment response. We examined blood‐oxygen‐level dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI) during an emotional processing task in patients with MDD to determine if pretreatment activation correlated with subsequent antidepressant response after ketamine. Methods: Participants included 31 patients with MDD, ages 18 to 65, who took part in this study as part of a large doubleblind placebo‐controlled protocol on the mechanism of action of ketamine. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after participants received an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). At baseline, BOLD signal was measured using a 3T GE fMRI scanner during an emotional processing task. In this mixed block/event‐related task, participants viewed faces with emotional expressions (angry, sad, neutral, and happy), randomly presented either rightside up or upside‐down. Participants were instructed to press a button to judge the emotion in one block and to identify the gender in the other block. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed using AFNI. Preprocessing included despiking, aligning images, registering echo‐planar to structural images, blurring to 6 mm, normalizing, and motion correction. Firstlevel individual analyses were conducted using regressors for each stimulus and block type. Group analysis used a multivariate model with the task factors and with a quantitative variable for the percent change in MADRS score from baseline to one day after the ketamine infusion. Results were thresholded at p<0.05, family wise error corrected (with voxel‐wise p<0.01). Results: We found a significant correlation between BOLD signal during the emotional processing task at baseline and percent change in MADRS score after ketamine. This was found in a large cluster in the left insula, extending into left inferior and middle frontal gyri, as well as in a cluster in the right precuneus. For both regions, greater activation at baseline was associated with better antidepressant response to ketamine (decrease in MADRS score of depressive symptoms). This was found across the entire task, not related to any specific task factors. We did not find any brain areas that showed the opposite pattern of greater activation correlating with poorer response. Conclusions: Our findings showed that pretreatment brain activity was correlated with response to ketamine, with the most significant result found in the left insula. The insula plays a role in emotional processing and has been previously associated with neuroimaging findings related to depression. While prior research has shown some associations between insula activation and response to other medications, there have been mixed findings. This could be related to different tasks being used or differential response depending on the specific treatment. Using functional neuroimaging as a biomarker to predict the likelihood of antidepressant response to ketamine would be greatly beneficial for patients with MDD. This would also be a valuable way for clinicians to work towards individualized treatment for psychiatric il ness."
"4415","1","Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.^
Given the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4 mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine’s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

"7071","1","Ecstasy exposure & gender: Examining components of verbal memory functioning.^
Objective: Studies have demonstrated verbal memory deficits associated with past year ecstasy use, although specific underlying components of these deficits are less understood. Further, prior research suggests potential gender differences in ecstasy-induced serotonergic changes. Therefore, the current study investigated whether gender moderated the relationship between ecstasy exposure and components of verbal memory after controlling for polydrug use and confounding variables. Method: Data were collected from 65 polydrug users with a wide range of ecstasy exposure (ages 18-35; 48 ecstasy and 17 marijuana users; 0-2310 ecstasy tablets). Participants completed a verbal learning and memory task, psychological questionnaires, and a drug use interview. Results: Increased past year ecstasy exposure predicted poorer short and long delayed free and cued recalls, retention, and recall discrimination. Male ecstasy users were more susceptible to dose-dependent deficits in retention than female users. Conclusion: Past year ecstasy consumption was associated with verbal memory retrieval, retention, and discrimination deficits in a dose-dependent manner in a sample of healthy young adult polydrug users. Male ecstasy users were at particular risk for deficits in retention following a long delay. Gender difference may be reflective of different patterns of polydrug use as well as increased hippocampal sensitivity. Future research examining neuronal correlates of verbal memory deficits in ecstasy users are needed."
"8797","1","Pharmacodynamic Interactions Between Ketamine and Psychiatric Medications Used in the Treatment of Depression: A Systematic Review.^
Background The use of ketamine for depression has increased rapidly in the past decades. Ketamine is often prescribed as an add-on to other drugs used in psychiatric patients, but clear information on drug-drug interactions is lacking. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of the pharmacodynamic interactions between ketamine and mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase-inhibitors, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants. Methods MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Results Twenty-four studies were included. For lithium, no significant interactions with ketamine were reported. Two out of 5 studies on lamotrigine indicated that the effects of ketamine were attenuated. Benzodiazepines were repeatedly shown to reduce the duration of ketamine's antidepressant effect. For the monoamine oxidase-inhibitor tranylcypromine, case reports showed no relevant changes in vital signs during concurrent S-ketamine use. One paper indicated an interaction between ketamine and haloperidol, 2 other studies did not. Four papers investigated risperidone, including 3 neuroimaging studies showing an attenuating effect of risperidone on ketamine-induced brain perfusion changes. Clozapine significantly blunted ketamine-induced positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia but not in healthy participants. One paper reported no effect of olanzapine on ketamine's acute psychotomimetic effects. Conclusion Current literature shows that benzodiazepines and probably lamotrigine reduce ketamine's treatment outcome, which should be taken into account when considering ketamine treatment. There is evidence for an interaction between ketamine and clozapine, haloperidol, and risperidone. Due to small sample sizes, different subject groups and various outcome parameters, the evidence is of low quality. More studies are needed to provide insight into pharmacodynamic interactions with ketamine."
"5214","0","Intravenous Ketamine Infusions for Neuropathic Pain Management: A Promising Therapy in Need of Optimization.^
Intravenous ketamine infusions have been used extensively to treat often-intractable neuropathic pain conditions. Because there are many widely divergent ketamine infusion protocols described in the literature, the variation in these protocols presents a challenge for direct comparison of one protocol with another and in discerning an optimal protocol. Careful examination of the published literature suggests that ketamine infusions can be useful to treat neuropathic pain and that certain characteristics of ketamine infusions may be associated with better clinical outcomes. Increased duration of relief from neuropathic pain is associated with (1) higher total infused doses of ketamine; (2) prolonged infusion durations, although the rate of infusion does not appear to be a factor; and (3) coadministration of adjunct medications such as midazolam and/or clonidine that mitigate some of the unpleasant psychomimetic side effects. However, there are few studies designed to optimize ketamine infusion protocols by defining what an effective infusion protocol entails with regard to a respective neuropathic pain condition. Therefore, despite common clinical practice, the current state of the literature leaves the use of ketamine infusions without meaningful guidance from high-quality comparative evidence. The objectives of this topical review are to (1) analyze the available clinical evidence related to ketamine infusion protocols and (2) call for clinical studies to identify optimal ketamine infusion protocols tailored for individual neuropathic pain conditions. The Oxford Center for Evidence-Based Medicine classification for levels of evidence was used to stratify the grades of clinical recommendation for each infusion variable studied."
"6806","0","Effects of a psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist on anxiety-related behavior and fear processing in mice.^
Psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy gained considerable interest as a novel treatment strategy for fear-related mental disorders but the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood. The serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptor is a key target underlying the effects of psychedelics on emotional arousal but its role in fear processing remains controversial. Using the psychedelic 5-HT2A/5-HT2C receptor agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4-iodoamphetamine (DOI) and 5-HT2A receptor knockout (KO) mice we investigated the effect of 5-HT2A receptor activation on emotional processing. We show that DOI administration did not impair performance in a spontaneous alternation task but reduced anxiety-like avoidance behavior in the elevated plus maze and elevated zero maze tasks. Moreover, we found that DOI did not block memory recall but diminished fear expression in a passive avoidance task. Likewise, DOI administration reduced fear expression in an auditory fear conditioning paradigm, while it did not affect retention of fear extinction when administered prior to extinction learning. The effect of DOI on fear expression was abolished in 5-HT2A receptor KO mice. Administration of DOI induced a significant increase of c-Fos expression in specific amygdalar nuclei. Moreover, local infusion of the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist M100907 into the amygdala reversed the effect of systemic administration of DOI on fear expression while local administration of DOI into the amygdala was sufficient to suppress fear expression. Our data demonstrate that activation of 5-HT2A receptors in the amygdala suppresses fear expression but provide no evidence for an effect on retention of fear extinction. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to American College of Neuropsychopharmacology."
"9539","0","Adolescent drug use initiation and transition into other drugs: A retrospective longitudinal examination across race/ethnicity.^
Background: Understanding adolescent drug use mechanisms is critical for drug use prevention. Although some theories such as the gateway theory suggest that drug users gradually transition into using more addictive drugs, there is no consensus about such a hypothesis. One important factor that hinders the advancement of knowledge in this area is the scarcity of longitudinal studies examining the type of drugs adolescents initially use and the different pathways adolescents take to transition into using other drugs as they grow older. Methods: Using the pooled sample of adolescent dug users (14–17 years old; n = 10,644) from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015–2018), we constructed longitudinal data on adolescents’ illicit drug use history other than the use of tobacco and alcohol based on the age of drug initiation. This allowed us to investigate what drugs were initially used by adolescents, how the use of these drugs may have progressed into a new drug, and whether there were racial/ethnic differences in the initiation and progression. The retrospective longitudinal data analyses applied life table method and Cox regression models. Results: Two thirds of the adolescent drug users initiated their drug use trajectories with marijuana, one quarter with inhalants, and the remaining with hallucinogens, prescription drugs, and hard drugs. Adolescent drug users who initiated with different drugs showed unique trajectories to the use of a new drug. By year 8, the probability of using a new drug was about 40% and 70% to 80% for adolescents who initiated with inhalants and other drugs, respectively. The probability of using a new drug for adolescents who initiated with marijuana and inhalants accumulated stably over time, and its difference with that of other drug users diminished over time. The multivariate Cox regression models suggest the observed discrepancies generally held after controlling for covariates. There were also racial/ethnic differences in adolescent drug use initiation and progression, with Black/African American adolescents being the least likely to switch to the use of a new drug. Conclusion: Adolescents’ initial use of marijuana and inhalants may lead to substantial risks of using other drugs over time. It is therefore important to screen adolescent drug use comprehensively and provide early interventions to prevent an escalation to more detrimental drugs. The findings provide new evidence to support aspects of both the gateway and generalized risk drug use theories."
"8732","1","Sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca on mental health and well-being in healthy ceremony attendants: A replication study.^
Background and aims: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the psychedelic plant tea, ayahuasca, holds therapeutic potential. Uthaug et al. (2018) demonstrated that a single dose of ayahuasca improved mental health sub-acutely and 4-weeks post-ceremony in healthy participants. The present study aimed to replicate and extend these findings. A first objective was to assess the sub-acute and longterm effects of ayahuasca on mental health and well-being in first-time and experienced users. A second aim was to extend the assessment of altered states of consciousness and how they relate to changes in mental health. Method: Ayahuasca ceremony attendants (N = 5 73) were assessed before, the day after, and four weeks following the ceremony. Results: We replicated the reduction in self-reported stress 4-weeks post ceremony, but, in contrast, found no reduction in depression. Also, increased satisfaction with life and awareness the day after the ceremony, and its return to baseline 4 weeks later, were replicated. New findings were: reduced ratings of anxiety and somatization, and increased levels of non-judging 4-weeks post-ceremony. We replicated the relation between altered states of consciousness (e.g., experienced ego dissolution during the ceremony) and mental health outcomes sub-acutely. The effects of ayahuasca did not differ between experienced and first-time users. Conclusion: Partly in line with previous findings, ayahuasca produces long-term improvements in affect in non-clinical users. Furthermore, sub-acute mental health ratings are related to the intensity of the psychedelic experience. Although findings replicate and highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, this needs to be confirmed in placebo-controlled studies.

"8019","0","Racial/ethnic disparities in ART adherence in the United States: Findings from the MACH14 study.^
Background: Minority race/ethnicity is generally associated with antiretroviral therapy nonadherence in US-based studies. Limitations of the existing literature include small samples, subjective adherence measures, and inadequate control for potential confounders such as mental health and substance use, which have been consistently associated with poorer adherence. Methods: Individual-level data were pooled from 13 US-based studies employing electronic drug monitoring to assess adherence. Adherence was operationalized as percent of prescribed doses taken from the first 12 (monthly) waves of data in each study. Depression symptoms were aggregated from several widely used assessments, and substance use was operationalized as any use of cocaine/stimulants, heroin/opiates, ecstasy, hallucinogens, or sedatives in the 30-365 days preceding baseline. Results: The final analytic sample of 1809 participants ranged in age from 18 to 72 years and was 67% male. Participants were 53% African American, 14% Latino, and 34% White. In a logistic regression adjusting for age, gender, income, education, and site, race/ethnicity was significantly associated with adherence (P < 0.001) and persisted in a model that also controlled for depression and substance use (P < 0.001), with African Americans having significantly lower adherence than Latinos [odds ratio (OR) = 0.72, P = 0.04] and whites (OR = 0.60, P < 0.001). Adherence did not differ between whites and Latinos (OR = 0.84, P = 0.27). Conclusions: Racial/ethnic differences in demographics, depression, and substance abuse do not explain the lower level of antiretroviral therapy adherence in African Americans observed in our sample. Further research is needed to explain the persistent disparity and might examine factors such as mistrust of providers, health literacy, and inequities in the health care system. © 2012 by Lippincott Williams & Wilkins."

"7488","1","Ayahuasca, a potentially rapid acting antidepressant: focus on safety and tolerability.^
INTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a psychedelic brew originally used by Amazonian indigenous groups and in religious rituals. Pre-clinical and observational studies have demonstrated its possible potential as an antidepressant, and open- and placebo-controlled clinical trials corroborated these results. For it to become an approved treatment for depression, its safety and tolerability need to be assessed and documented. AREAS COVERED: We have gathered data regarding the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in all reported randomized, placebo-controlled trials with healthy and clinical populations involving ayahuasca administration (n = 108 ayahuasca administrations). We systematically categorized these results, recorded their prevalence, and discussed the possible mechanisms related to their emergence. EXPERT OPINION: There were no reports of serious AEs, indicating a relative safety of ayahuasca administration in controlled settings. Most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, headaches, and transient increases in cardiovascular measurements. Ayahuasca research is still in its infancy, especially concerning the absence of large and robust clinical trials to verify its antidepressant effects. Dose standardization, legal prohibition of the possession of its alkaloids and how traditional communities will be compensated if ayahuasca becomes an approved medicine are the biggest obstacles to overcome for its future use in the therapeutic context."

Although there is research interest to assess attitudes on psychedelics, no validated instrument exists for this purpose. We aimed to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Attitudes on Psychedelics Questionnaire (APQ) in a sample of the Croatian general population. A cross-sectional, web-based survey among the general population was conducted on 1153 participants (62.1% female, 77.7% with a graduate or high school degree, 15.1% health care workers). We assessed participants’ ability to recognize psychedelic substances using a short knowledge test. The APQ consists of 20 items with four sub-scales: Legal Use of Psychedelics, Effects of Psychedelics, Risk Assessment of Psychedelics, and Openness to Psychedelics. This model demonstrated best fit in a confirmatory factor analysis. Total scale reliability was excellent (McDonald’s ω = 0.949, 95% CI = 0.944–0.953). A strong correlation with a similar unvalidated measure (r = 0.885, P < 0.001) demonstrated convergent validity. We observed an association between attitudes and knowledge on psychedelics (r = 0.494, P < 0.001). Younger age, male gender, and lower educational status were associated with higher APQ scores. The APQ is valid, reliable, and could be applied in assessing educational interventions, patients’ treatment outcomes, and the attitudes of different groups of experts.

The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks."
"7829","1","Acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methylphenidate on circulating steroid levels in healthy subjects.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') and methylphenidate are widely used psychoactive substances. MDMA primarily enhances serotonergic neurotransmission, and methylphenidate increases dopamine but has no serotonergic effects. Both drugs also increase norepinephrine, resulting in sympathomimetic properties. Here we studied the effects of MDMA and methylphenidate on 24-hour plasma steroid profiles. 16 healthy subjects (8 men, 8 women) were treated with single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), MDMA + methylphenidate, and placebo on 4 separate days using a cross-over study design. Cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, aldosterone, 11-deoxycorticosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA), dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate (DHEAS), androstenedione, and testosterone were repeatedly measured up to 24 h using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectroscopy. MDMA significantly increased the plasma concentrations of cortisol, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 11-deoxycorticosterone and also tended to moderately increase aldosterone levels compared with placebo. MDMA also increased the sum of cortisol + cortisone and the cortisol/cortisone ratio, consistent with an increase in glucocorticoid production. MDMA did not alter the levels of cortisone, DHEA, DHEAS, androstenedione, or testosterone. Methylphenidate did not affect any of the steroid concentrations, and it did not change the effects of MDMA on circulating steroids. In summary, the serotonin releaser MDMA has acute effects on circulating steroids. These effects are not observed after stimulation of the dopamine and norepinephrine systems with methylphenidate. The present findings support the view that serotonin rather than dopamine and norepinephrine mediates the acute pharmacologically induced stimulation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in the absence of other stressors."
"9579","1","Acute effects of ketamine and esketamine on cognition in healthy subjects: A meta-analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Impairment in cognition is frequently associated with acute ketamine administration. However, some questions remain unanswered as to which deficits are most prominent and what variables modulate these effects. METHODS: A literature search yielded 56 experimental studies of acute ketamine administration that assessed cognition in 1041 healthy volunteers. A multivariate meta-analysis was performed, and effect sizes were estimated for eleven cognitive domains: attention, executive function, response inhibition, social cognition, speed of processing, verbal / language, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning & memory, visuospatial abilities, and working memory. RESULTS: There were small-to-moderate impairments across all cognitive domains. Deficits in verbal learning / memory were most prominent, whereas response inhibition was the least affected. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the negative effects of ketamine on cognition are dependent on infusion dose and plasma level, but unaffected by enantiomer type, route of administration, sex or age. A publication bias was observed. DISCUSSION: Acute ketamine broadly impairs cognition across all domains among healthy individuals. Verbal learning and memory figures most prominently in cognitive impairment elicited by acute ketamine administration."
"7713","1","Long-term neuropsychological effects of ecstasy in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users.^
Rationale: Studies reporting ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro)psychological dysfunctions have been conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory. There was no clear support for an interaction between harmful effects of ecstasy use and age-related memory decline or mid-life depression. © 2009 The Author(s)."
"9204","0","Weeding out the truth: a systematic review and meta-analysis on the transition from cannabis use to opioid use and opioid use disorders, abuse or dependence.^
BACKGROUND AND AIMS: The idea that cannabis is a 'gateway drug' to more harmful substances such as opioids is highly controversial, yet has substantially impacted policy, education and how we conceptualize substance use. Given a rise in access to cannabis products and opioid-related harm, the current study aimed to conduct the first systematic review and meta-analysis on the likelihood of transitioning from cannabis use to subsequent first-time opioid use, opioid use disorders (OUD), dependence or abuse. METHODS: Following Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, pubMed/MEDLINE, Scopus, EMBASE, PsychINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Informit Health Collection were searched for full-text articles assessing the likelihood of transitioning from cannabis to subsequent opioid use, and from opioid use to OUD, abuse or dependence given prior cannabis use. Analysis of subpopulations within studies were discussed narratively, and E-values were calculated to assess the potential influence of unmeasured confounding. FINDINGS: Six studies provided relevant data from the United States, Australia and New Zealand between 1977 and 2017, a total sample of 102 461 participants. Random-effects analysis of the adjusted pooled effect size indicates that the likelihood of transitioning from cannabis to opioid use, relative to non-cannabis users, is odds ratio (OR) = 2.76, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.26-3.36, whereas the likelihood of transitioning from opioid use to OUD, abuse or dependence given prior cannabis use is OR = 2.52, 95% CI = 1.65-3.84. While the evidence was determined to be of low quality with moderate risk of bias, E-values suggest that these findings are robust against unmeasured confounding. CONCLUSION: A systematic review and meta-analysis found that while people who use cannabis are disproportionately more likely to initiate opioid use and engage in problematic patterns of use than people who do not use cannabis, the low quality of the evidence must be considered when interpreting these findings."

Objective: To examine the impact of different doses of buprenorphine on depression symptoms in opioid dependent inpatient over a three-day interval, using a randomized clinical trial design (RCT). Design: Patients were randomized and assigned to three groups. Participants: Forty males who were admitted to an inpatient psychiatric unit and who fulfilled the DSM-5 criteria for both opioid dependence and major depressive disorder. Intervention: Patients randomly received 32 mg, 64 mg, or 96 mg of buprenorphine as a single high dose. Out of 40 patients, 11 (27.5%) received 32 mg, 14 (35%) received 64 mg and 15 (37.5%) received 96 mg of buprenorphine. We conducted medical precautional measures, including cardiovascular and respiratory monitoring. Measurements: Depression wasmeasured by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). All patients completed the three-day treatment duration. The results showed a significant reduction in depression symptoms within each of the three groups (p = 0.00), although there was no significant difference in depression outcome across the groups (p = 0.90). Conclusions: The results suggest that a single high dose of buprenorphine could provide a safe, simple and speedy means of depression improvement. A single high dose of buprenorphine can be used as medication that supplies a fast and maintained treatment for major depressive disorder in patients who are opioid dependent. Placebo-controlled trials of longer periods and larger sample sizes are needed to test ability and safety, as well as the physiological and psychological impact of extended exposure to this drug."
"3903","1","Daily oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care: a 28-day open-label proof-of-concept trial.^
BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent and undertreated in patients receiving hospice care. Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted. The findings of the potential efficacy of oral ketamine for depression and the response of anxiety symptoms are novel. Further investigation with randomized, controlled clinical trials is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other subject populations."
"6251","0","Night-time Dexmedetomidine-esketamine Infusion and Sleep Quality With Mechanical Ventilation.^
Sleep disturbances are common in patients with mechanical ventilation during intensive care unit (ICU) stay. Persistent sleep disturbances are associated with negative outcomes, including increased sensitivity to pain, increased risk of delirium and cardiovascular events, and delayed weaning from mechanical ventilation. Dexmedetomidine and ketamine are both suggested for sedation and analgesia in ICU patients. Previous studies showed that night‐time dexmedetomidine infusion may improve sleep quality in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation, the effect is dose‐dependent. However, sedative dose dexmedetomidine increases adverse events inculding bradycardia and hypotension. Recent studies suggest that ketamine/esketamine may also improve sleep quality. But even low‐dose ketamine/esketamine increases adverse events including psychiatric and dissociative symptoms. We suppose that combined use of low‐dose dexmedetomidine and esketamine may produce synergic effects in improving sleep quality in ICU patients with less adverse events. The purpose of this trial is to observe whether night‐time infusion of low‐dose dexmedetomidine‐esketamine combination can improve sleep structure of patients with mechanical ventilation in ICU patients with mechanical ventilation and the safety of this regimen."

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-66698-001[/rid]). Ketamine is an effective intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), including late-in-life (LL-TRD). The proposed mechanism of antidepressant effects of ketamine is a glutamatergic surge, which can be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma oscillations. Yet, non-linear EEG biomarkers of ketamine effects such as neural complexity are needed to capture broader systemic effects, represent the level of organization of synaptic communication, and elucidate mechanisms of action for treatment responders. In a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial, we investigated two EEG neural complexity markers (Lempel-Ziv complexity [LZC] and multiscale entropy [MSE]) of rapid (baseline to 240 min) and post-rapid ketamine (24 h and 7 days) effects after one 40-min infusion of IV ketamine or midazolam (active control) in 33 military veterans with LL-TRD. We also studied the relationship between complexity and Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score change at 7 days post-infusion. We found that LZC and MSE both increased 30 min post-infusion, with effects not localized to a single timescale for MSE. Post-rapid effects of reduced complexity with ketamine were observed for MSE. No relationship was observed between complexity and reduction in depressive symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that a single sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion has time-varying effects on system-wide contributions to the evoked glutamatergic surge in LL-TRD. Further, changes to complexity were observable outside the time-window previously shown for effects on gamma oscillations. These preliminary results have clinical implications in providing a functional marker of ketamine that is non-linear, amplitude-independent, and represents larger dynamic properties, providing strong advantages over linear measures in highlighting ketamine’s effects.

"1415","0","Alcohol consumption in Iran: A systematic review and meta-analysis of the literature.^
Issues Alcohol production, marketing and consumption are illegal in Iran. This systematic review examines the lifetime and last 12-month prevalence of alcohol consumption among the general and young population in Iran. Approach We searched Web of Science, PubMed, Embase, Scopus and Iranian scientific databases (i.e. Scientific Information Database and Magiran) for relevant publications in English and Persian from inception to 12 May 2019. Following a random-effects meta-analysis, we estimated the pooled prevalence of alcohol consumption among the general population and young people (<30 years old). Meta-regression was used to identify potential sources of heterogeneity. Key Findings Of the 2400 identified records, 62 met the inclusion criteria. The overall pooled prevalence of lifetime alcohol consumption among the general population and young people was 13.0% [95% confidence intervals (CI) 10.0, 16.0]. The overall pooled prevalence of last 12-month alcohol consumption was 12.0% (95% CI 7.0, 18.0) for the general population and 15.0% (95% CI 9.0, 22.0) for young people. The prevalence of alcohol consumption varied from 0.03% to 68.0% in different regions, 0.3% to 66.6% among males and 0.2% to 21.0% among females. Implications Our findings highlight the need for public health surveillance of alcohol use in Iran. Conclusion These estimates show that, on average, one in eight people in the general population have ever consumed alcohol in Iran, indicating that alcohol consumption is not an uncommon practice in the country."

Analysis of 17 studies revealed a small to moderate sized effect (mean weighted r=0.211, 95% CI: 0.085-0.336). Random-effects homogeneity testing was non-significant, thus formal moderator analyses were not performed. Moreover, numerical and visual diagnostics suggested that publication bias was not a concern. It is hoped that the present meta-analytic findings and recommendations will encourage investigators to broaden their research methodologies and will stimulate new insights into the association between ecstasy use and risky sexual behavior."

Psychostimulants are known to have a huge impact on different forms of social behaviour. The aim of the present study was to compare the effects of three different psychostimulants [amphetamine, cocaine and 3,4 methylenedimethoxyamphetamine (MDMA)] on social interaction (SI) in adult male rats. The SI test was performed in a familiar arena and under low-stress environmental conditions. Experimental animals received amphetamine (0.5, 1.0, 1.5mg/kg), cocaine (0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.5, 5.0, 10.0mg/kg) or MDMA (2.5, 5.0, 10mg/kg) and control animals received saline (1ml/kg) 45min before the SI test. Time spent in SI (individual patterns of social behaviour) and nonsocial activities (locomotion and rearing) were video recorded and then analysed offline, with the following results: (a) all doses of amphetamine decreased SI. Specifically, all doses of amphetamine decreased mutual sniffing, and the higher doses also decreased allo-grooming and following behaviours. (b) The higher doses of cocaine decreased SI, especially mutual sniffing, allo-grooming and climbing over. Cocaine at the dose of 5.0 mg/kg increased genital investigation compared with lower doses. (c) All doses of MDMA decreased mutual sniffing and climbing over; the two higher doses decreased allo-grooming behaviour, and only the highest dose decreased following. The two higher doses of amphetamine and all the doses of MDMA increased locomotion and rearing; cocaine did not affect locomotion, but increased rearing at higher doses. In conclusion, the results confirm the well-known finding that psychostimulants suppress SI, but also show novel differences in the effects of psychostimulants on specific patterns of SI. © 2015 Wolters Kluwer Health, Inc.

Patients from the two groups received a sub-anesthetic dose of racemic ketamine hydrochloride or midazolam. Suicidal ideation score, measured with the Beck Scale and suicidal part of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, significantly decreased on day 1 and day 3 in ketamine-treated patients when compared to those treated with midazolam. Consistently, overall depression levels measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale indicated a significant relief of overall depression on day 1 in ketamine-treated patients. Collectively, this study provides novel information about the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine on acute depression and suicidal ideation in newly-diagnosed cancer patients."
"6325","1","Ketamine and Other NMDA Antagonists: Early Clinical Trials and Possible Mechanisms in Depression.^
OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution."
"554","0","Tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) predicts escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking in rats.^
Pre-clinical studies of individual differences in addiction vulnerability have been increasing over recent years, but the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) has received relatively little attention in this regard. Previously, we reported large individual differences both in rats' initial behavioral response to experimenter-administered MDMA and their degree of behavioral sensitization to repeated administration. To determine whether these differences could predict subsequent patterns of MDMA-taking or -seeking behaviors we used the self-administration-extinction-reinstatement model to examine addiction-like behavior (i.e., escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking) in rats a priori characterized for either locomotor sensitization or tolerance to MDMA. Rats that developed tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of MDMA had a significantly larger locomotor response to the first MDMA injection relative to rats that developed sensitization. Importantly, rats that developed tolerance subsequently displayed an escalation of MDMA self-administration over days, as well as clear cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking following extinction. Conversely, rats that developed locomotor sensitization to MDMA subsequently maintained relatively stable levels of MDMA self-administration over days and showed no cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking. These results show that differences in the level of psychomotor activation following acute and repeated MDMA administration can reliably predict two important addiction-like behaviors in rats, which may have implications in the prediction of compulsive MDMA use in humans.

"6691","0","MDMA administration attenuates hippocampal IL-β immunoreactivity and subsequent stress-enhanced fear learning: An animal model of PTSD.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a devastating disorder that involves maladaptive changes in immune status. Using the stress-enhanced fear learning (SEFL) paradigm, an animal model of PTSD, our laboratory has demonstrated increased pro-inflammatory cytokine immunoreactivity in the hippocampus following severe stress. Recent clinical trials have demonstrated 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy as an effective novel treatment for PTSD. Interestingly, MDMA has been shown to have an immunosuppressive effect in both pre-clinical and clinical studies. Therefore, we predict MDMA administration may attenuate SEFL, in part, due to an immunosuppressive mechanism. The current studies test the hypothesis that MDMA is capable of attenuating SEFL and inducing alterations in expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), an astrocyte specific marker, and ionized calcium-binding adapter molecule -1 (IBA-1), a microglial specific marker, in the dorsal hippocampus (DH) following a severe stressor in male animals. To this end, experiment 1 determined the effect of MDMA administration 0, 24, and 48 h following a severe foot shock stressor on SEFL. We identified that MDMA administration significantly attenuated SEFL. Subsequently, experiment 2 determined the effect of MDMA administration following a severe stressor on the expression of TNF-α, IL-1β, GFAP, and IBA-1 in the DH. We found that MDMA administration significantly attenuated stress-induced IL-1β and stress-reduced IBA-1 but had no effect on TNF-α or GFAP. Overall, these results support the hypothesis that MDMA blocks SEFL through an immunosuppressive mechanism and supports the use of MDMA as a potential therapeutic agent for those experiencing this disorder. Together, these experiments are the first to examine the effect of MDMA in the SEFL model and these data contribute significantly towards the clinical PTSD findings."
"7263","1","Ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy for depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for depressive disorder. Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic. However, ketamine cautiously needs to be administered in ECT due to the possibility of increased risk of side effects."

A pathophysiological role for inflammation in schizophrenia has been one of the more enduring findings in the field. Recently, increased understanding of complex interactions between inflammation and the brain in other chronic diseases has better informed this relationship in schizophrenia. Several trials have found that treatment with non‐steroidal anti‐inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), in adjunct to antipsychotics, was associated with significant improvement in psychopathology in schizophrenia. Cytokines are key regulators of inflammation that exert effects in the periphery and the brain. Serum cytokine levels predicted response in two studies , and another study found a trend for improved cognition with adjunctive NSAID treatment. These findings provide important empirical support for a pathophysiological role for inflammation in some patients with schizophrenia. Two important limitations of these trials are that: a) the agents investigated have relevant off‐target (i.e., non‐immune) effects, and b) evidence of inflammation in the peripheral blood was not an inclusion criterion, which may have decreased the signal‐to‐noise ratio. Schizophrenia is associated with impaired cognition, which persists despite current treatments, and is an important determinant of quality of life and overall function. Converging lines of evidence suggest that interleukin‐6 (IL‐6) is a promising therapeutic target for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia. IL‐6 is a cytokine produced by peripheral blood leukocytes, and central nervous system (CNS) microglia and astrocytes. The IL‐6 gene is a risk factor for schizophrenia and may impact on serum IL‐6 levels. Blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) IL‐6 levels are altered in schizophrenia. IL‐6 levels are associated with psychopathology and cognition in schizophrenia. Serum IL‐6 levels are also increased in prodromal psychosis, drug‐naïve first‐episode psychosis (FEP) and first‐degree relatives of patients with schizophrenia. In populations outside of schizophrenia, higher serum IL‐6 levels are associated with poorer cognition, cognitive decline, and smaller hippocampal volume. In FEP and chronic schizophrenia, IL‐6 levels are a significant predictor of smaller left hippocampal volume. Evidence from animal studies also supports a putative role for IL‐6 in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. A single maternal injection of IL‐6 during mouse pregnancy caused prepulse and latent inhibition deficits in the adult offspring. In rat prenatal immune activation models, adult offspring have increased serum IL‐6 levels, at an age with homology to the usual age of onset of schizophrenia, that are modulated by antipsychotics. Ketamine‐induced neuronal production of IL‐6 is responsible for the activation of brain N=nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)‐oxidase and dysfunction of fast‐spiking parvalbumin‐expressing interneurons. In the first year following the submission, one clinical trial is planned. The investigators will conduct a 9‐week randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled trial to determine the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of siltuximab as an adjunct to antipsychotic medications in 30 stable outpatients with schizophrenia. Along with our other previous work, our preliminary studies provide strong evidence that IL‐6 is a novel therapeutic target for cognitive impairment in schizophrenia, and demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed trial. Briefly, in 64 patients with schizophrenia, the investigators found higher blood IL‐6 levels were a significant predictor of greater impairment on the Brief Assessment of Cognition in Schizophrenia (BACS) after controlling for multiple potential confounding factors. In an 8‐week open‐label trial in 6 subjects, tocilizumab (an anti‐IL‐6 receptor monoclonal antibody), given in adjunct to antipsychotics, was well tolerated and associated with significant improvement in BACS verbal fluency at 4 weeks, BACS digit symbol coding at 2, 4, and 8 weeks, and BACS composite score at 4 and 8 weeks. Siltuximab has not been used before in the treatment of schizophrenia, and using it this way is experimental. The risks that have been found in people with multicentric Castleman's disease are known, but there may be unknown risks when used in schizophrenia. Clinically significant adverse drug reactions include anaphylaxis, renal failure, and pneumonia. Known side effects of siltuximab that are common include: swelling of the extremities, fatigue, itching, rash, weight gain, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and joint or limb pain. The most common side effect of the drug is nasopharyngitis, which occurs in 63% of subjects with long‐term exposure to Siltuximab. Subjects with schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder will be accessed from outpatient psychiatry clinic at Augusta University or other satellite collaborative sites. The study has 5 visits: screening, baseline, and weeks 3, 6, and 9. Subjects will be randomized equally to either siltuximab (n=15) or placebo (n=15), in adjunct to their current antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications. The study has 5 visits: screening, baseline, and weeks 3, 6, and 9. Subjects will be randomized equally to either siltuximab (n=15) or placebo (n=15), in adjunct to their current antipsychotic and other psychotropic medications. Subjects in the siltuximab group will receive an 11 mg/kg infusion at baseline, and weeks 3 and 6, as per the recommended dosing for multicentric Castleman's disease. Subjects in the placebo group will receive an infusion of normal saline (with the same packaging and volume as the siltuximab group) at baseline, and weeks 3 and 6. Subjects will be monitored for an additional 30 minutes following the completion of the infusion. Dr. Miller will monitor the subject throughout the infusion and the 30 minute post‐infusion period. The investigators will contact the subjects by phone on days 1 and 7 after each infusion to assess for any infusion‐related events. The investigators will assess cognition and psychopathology at baseline, and at weeks 3, 6, and 9. The investigators will also measure a multiplex panel of blood cytokines (including IL‐6) and tryptophan catabolites at baseline, and at weeks 3, 6, and 9. At Screening, all subjects will be administered the evaluation to sign consent, informed consent, and the structured clinical interview for Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) psychosis and affective disorders modules. The investigators will perform a medical history and physical exam, fasting labs (complete blood count [CBC], complete metabolic profile [CMP], hsCRP, lipid panel, urinalysis, and urine drug screen (UDS), hepatitis panel, HIV, rapid plasma reagin [RPR], and human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG] in females), a tuberculin skin test, and a 12‐lead electrocardiogram. At Baseline, the investigators will perform the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), BACS, and Clinical Global Impressions scale (CGI), Calgary Depression Scale (CDS) and Short Form Health Survey (SF‐36) and draw blood for IL‐6 and high‐sensitivity c‐reactive protein (hsCRP). At Week 3, 6, and 9, the investigators will perform an interval history, physical exam, PANSS, BACS, CGI, CDS, SF‐36, and obtain fasting labs (CBC, CMP, lipid panel, hsCRP, urinalysis, UDS, and hCG in females). Different versions of the BACS will be used to avoid practice effects. Patients will be withdrawn if they meet any exclusion criterion at any time point."
"6359","0","Glutamate receptor antagonists as fast-acting therapeutic alternatives for the treatment of depression: ketamine and other compounds.^
The N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapid and potent antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. These effects are in direct contrast to the more modest effects seen after weeks of treatment with classic monoaminergic antidepressants. Numerous open-label and case studies similarly validate ketamine's antidepressant properties. These clinical findings have been reverse-translated into preclinical models in an effort to elucidate ketamine's antidepressant mechanism of action, and three important targets have been identified: mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR), eukaryotic elongation factor 2 (eEF2), and glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3). Current clinical and preclinical research is focused on (a) prolonging/maintaining ketamine's antidepressant effects, (b) developing more selective NMDA receptor antagonists free of ketamine's adverse effects, and (c) identifying predictor, mediator/moderator, and treatment response biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effects."
"2956","1","Magnetoencephalography biomarkers of suicide attempt history and antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant major depression.^
BACKGROUND: This study examined magnetoencephalographic (MEG) correlates of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt history in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD) at baseline and following subanesthetic-dose ketamine infusion. METHODS: Twenty-nine drug-free TRD patients (12 suicide attempters/17 non-attempters) participated in a crossover randomized trial of ketamine. MEG data were collected during an attentional dot probe task with emotional face stimuli at baseline and several hours post-ketamine infusion. Synthetic aperture magnetometry was used to project source power in the theta, alpha, beta, and gamma frequencies for angry-neutral, happy-neutral, and neutral-neutral face pairings during a one-second peristimulus period. Mixed models were used to test for clinical, behavioral, and electrophysiological effects of group, emotion, session, and SI score. RESULTS: Ketamine significantly reduced SI and depression across the sample. Post-ketamine, attempters had improved accuracy and non-attempters had reduced accuracy on the task. SI was positively associated with gamma power in regions of the frontal and parietal cortices across groups. In an extended amygdala-hippocampal region, attempters differed significantly in their emotional reactivity to angry versus happy faces as indexed by theta power differences, irrespective of drug. Ketamine significantly reduced the association between alpha power and SI for angry compared with happy faces in a fronto-insular/anterior cingulate region important for regulating sensory attentiveness. LIMITATIONS: Limitations include a small sample size of attempters. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight key differences in band-limited power between attempters and non-attempters and reinforce previous findings that ketamine has distinct response properties in patients with a suicide history."
"7731","0","Deep brain stimulation for major depression: A prototype of a personalized treatment in psychiatry.^
The need for personalized treatment in psychiatry is obvious: regarding major depression, a third of patients are still not treated effectively, even after several treatment attempts with conventional antidepressant treatments such as pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, or electroconvulsive therapy. A large variety of classes of antidepressants, novel pharmacological approaches such as ketamine, and special psychotherapeutic treatments, for example, cognitive behavioral analysis system of psychotherapy are available for the treatment of depression. In addition, several approved brain stimulation techniques, for example, electroconvulsive therapy, transcranial magnetic stimulation, and vagus nerve stimulation are often used later in the treatment course. Finally, after treatment resistance to conventional approaches, deep brain stimulation (DBS) is currently under research in clinical studies as an experimental and invasive option for some patients. DBS will be presented as a treatment option for severe treatment-resistant patients suffering from depression. DBS can be seen as prototypal of personalized treatment in major depression. Very likely, a combination of different biomarkers and clinical features will be useful to assign patients to a treatment regimen. This chapter provides a brief description about DBS. It discusses current research strategies for the individualized treatment of depression. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5403","0","Glutamate modulators as novel interventions for mood disorders.^
Recent evidence suggests that critical molecules in neurotrophic signaling cascades are long-term targets for currently available monoaminergic antidepressants. As chronic and severe mood disorders are characterized by impairments in neuronal resilience, pharmacological strategies that subserve a neuroprotective function might alter disorder pathophysiology and modify disease progression. Several promising approaches involve modulation of the glutamate neurotransmitter system, via post-synaptic receptor blockade or potentiation and presynaptic vesicular release inhibition. A focused review of the extant scientific literature was conducted, with a discussion of 3 compounds or classes of drugs currently undergoing clinical investigation: ketamine, riluzole, and AMPA receptor potentiators. Recent investigations in mood disordered patients suggest that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine might demonstrate rapid antidepressant properties. Riluzole has been shown to reverse glutamate-mediated impairments in neuronal plasticity and to stimulate the synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor. Open-label trials in treatment-resistant depression have yielded promising results. Likewise, AMPA receptor potentiators favorably impact neurotrophic factors as well as enhance cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological approaches that modulate components of the glutamate system offer novel targets for severe, recurrent mood disorders. Controlled studies are necessary."
"1232","0","Serotonergic Psychedelics: Experimental Approaches for Assessing Mechanisms of Action.^
Recent, well-controlled - albeit small-scale - clinical trials show that serotonergic psychedelics, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, possess great promise for treating psychiatric disorders, including treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, fresh results from a deluge of clinical neuroimaging studies are unveiling the dynamic effects of serotonergic psychedelics on functional activity within, and connectivity across, discrete neural systems. These observations have led to testable hypotheses regarding neural processing mechanisms that contribute to psychedelic effects and therapeutic benefits. Despite these advances and a plethora of preclinical and clinical observations supporting a central role for brain serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors in producing serotonergic psychedelic effects, lingering and new questions about mechanisms abound. These chiefly pertain to molecular neuropharmacology. This chapter is devoted to illuminating and discussing such questions in the context of preclinical experimental approaches for studying mechanisms of action of serotonergic psychedelics, classic and new."
"924","0","Different likelihood ratio approaches to evaluate the strength of evidence of MDMA tablet comparisons.^
Two likelihood ratio (LR) approaches are presented to evaluate the strength of evidence of MDMA tablet comparisons. The first one is based on a more 'traditional' comparison of MDMA tablets by using distance measures (e.g., Pearson correlation distance or a Euclidean distance). In this approach, LRs are calculated using the distribution of distances between tablets of the same-batch and that of different-batches. The second approach is based on methods used in some other fields of forensic comparison. Here LRs are calculated based on the distribution of values of MDMA tablet characteristics within a specific batch and from all batches. The data used in this paper must be seen as examples to illustrate both methods. In future research the methods can be applied to other and more complex data. In this paper, the methods and their results are discussed, considering their performance in evidence evaluation and several practical aspects. With respect to evidence in favor of the correct hypothesis, the second method proved to be better than the first one. It is shown that the LRs in same-batch comparisons are generally higher compared to the first method and the LRs in different-batch comparisons are generally lower. On the other hand, for operational purposes (where quick information is needed), the first method may be preferred, because it is less time consuming. With this method a model has to be estimated only once in a while, which means that only a few measurements have to be done, while with the second method more measurements are needed because each time a new model has to be estimated. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"5494","1","A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ketamine in the rapid treatment of major depressive episodes.^
BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in glutamatergic agents in depression, particularly ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We aimed to assess the efficacy of ketamine in major depressive episodes. METHOD: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Medline from 1962 to January 2014 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post-treatment. Analyses employed a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from seven RCTs employing an intravenous infusion and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 73 subjects in parallel arms and 110 subjects in cross-over designs [n = 34 with bipolar disorder (BD), n = 149 with major depressive disorder (MDD)]. Ketamine was associated with higher rates of clinical remission relative to comparator (saline or midazolam) at 24 h [OR 7.06, number needed to treat (NNT) = 5], 3 days (OR 3.86, NNT = 6), and 7 days (OR 4.00, NNT = 6), as well as higher rates of clinical response at 24 h (OR 9.10, NNT = 3), 3 days (OR 6.77, NNT = 3), and 7 days (OR 4.87, NNT = 4). A standardized mean difference of 0.90 in favor of ketamine was observed at 24 h based on depression rating scale scores, with group comparisons revealing greater efficacy in unipolar depression compared to bipolar depression (1.07 v. 0.68). Ketamine was associated with transient psychotomimetic effects, but no persistent psychosis or affective switches. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that single administrations ketamine are efficacious in the rapid treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression. Additional research is required to determine optimal dosing schedules, route, treatment schedules, and the potential efficacy of other glutamatergic agents."
"1919","0","Human pharmacology of MDMA: pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and disposition.^
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors ""entactogen"" properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme-metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system."
"226","0","Alleviation of Cocaine Withdrawal and Pertinent Interactions between Salvinorin-Based Antagonists and Kappa Opioid Receptor.^
The kappa opioid receptor (KOR) is involved in the regulation of both the reward and mood processes. Recent reports find that the use of drugs of abuse increases the production of dynorphin and the overall activation of KOR. Long-acting KOR antagonists, such as norbinaltorphimine (nor-BNI), JDTic, and 5′-guanidinonaltrindole (GNTI), have been shown to stop depressive and anxiety-related disorders, which are the common side effects of withdrawal that can lead to a relapse in drug use. Unfortunately, these prototypical KOR antagonists are known to induce selective KOR antagonism that is delayed by hours and extremely prolonged, and their use in humans comes with serious safety concerns because they possess a large window for potential drug-drug interactions. Furthermore, their persistent pharmacodynamic activities can hinder the ability to reverse unanticipated side effects immediately. Herein, we report our studies of the lead selective, salvinorin-based KOR antagonist (1) as well as nor-BNI on C57BL/6N male mice for spontaneous cocaine withdrawal. Assessment of pharmacokinetics showed that 1 is a short-acting compound with an average half-life of 3.75 h across different compartments (brain, spinal cord, liver, and plasma). Both 1 (5 mg/kg) and nor-BNI (5 mg/kg) were shown to reduce spontaneous withdrawal behavior in mice, with 1 producing additional anti-anxiety-like behavior in a light-dark transition test (however, no mood-related effects of 1 or nor-BNI were observed at the current dosing in an elevated plus maze or a tail suspension test). Our results support the study of selective, short-acting KOR antagonists for the treatment of psychostimulant withdrawal and the associated negative mood states that contribute to relapse. Furthermore, we identified pertinent interactions between 1 and KOR via computational studies, including induced-fit docking, mutagenesis, and molecular dynamics simulations, to gain insight into the design of future selective, potent, and short-acting salvinorin-based KOR antagonists. © 2023 American Chemical Society."
"3631","1","Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Psilocybin Administration in Healthy Participants.^
Psilocybin is being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Only a few studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of psilocybin and have used body weight-adjusted dosing. Data on PKs and the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of fixed doses that are commonly used are unavailable. The present study characterized the PKs and PK-PD relationship of 15, 25, and 30 mg of orally administered psilocybin in 28, 23, and 28 healthy subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of unconjugated psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) and corresponding subjective effects were repeatedly assessed up to 24 hours. PK parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using PK-PD modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal psilocin concentrations were 11 ng/mL (10-13), 17 ng/mL (16-19), and 21 ng/mL (19-24) after the administration of 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after an average of 2 hours. Elimination half-lives were 1.8 hours (1.7-2.0), 1.4 hours (1.2-1.7), and 1.8 hours (1.6-1.9) for 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Mean (± SD) durations of subjective effects were 5.6 ± 2.2 hours, 5.5 ± 1.6 hours, and 6.4 ± 2.2 hours, and maximal effects (""any drug"" effects) were 58% ± 25%, 73% ± 27%, and 80% ± 18% after 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Psilocin exhibited dose-proportional PKs. The duration and intensity of subjective effects were dose-dependent. Body weight did not influence pharmacokinetics or the response to psilocybin. These data may serve as a reference for future clinical trials."
"7798","1","Urinary excretion kinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and its phase I and phase II metabolites in humans following controlled MDMA administration.^
BACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is excreted inhuman urine as unchanged drug and phase I and II metabolites. Previous urinary excretion studies after controlled oral MDMA administration have been performed only after conjugate cleavage. Therefore, we investigated intact MDMA glucuronide and sulfate metabolite excretion. METHODS: We used LC-high-resolution MS and GC-MS to reanalyze blind urine samples from 10 participants receiving 1.0 or 1.6 mg/kg MDMA orally. We determined median C(max),t(max), first and last detection times, and total urinary recovery; calculated ratios of sulfates and glucuronides; and performed in vitro-in vivo correlations. RESULTS: Phase II metabolites of 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA),4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA),3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (DHA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine were identified, although only DHMA sulfates, HMMA sulfate, and HMMA glucuronide had substantial abundance. Good correlation was observed for HMMA measured after acid hydrolysis and the sum of unconjugated HMMA, HMMA glucuronide, and HMMA sulfate (R(2) = 0.87). More than 90% of total DHMA and HMMA were excreted as conjugates. The analyte with the longest detection time was HMMA sulfate. Median HMMA sulfate/glucuronide and DHMA 3-sulfate/4-sulfate ratios for the first 24 h were 2.0 and 5.3, respectively, in accordance with previous in vitro calculations from human liver microsomes and cytosol experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Human MDMA urinary metabolites are primarily sulfates and glucuronides,with sulfates present in higher concentrations than glucuronides. This new knowledge may lead to improvements in urine MDMA and metabolite analysis in clinical and forensic toxicology, particularly for the performance of direct urine analysis."

"1165","1","Effect of Analgesic Low-Dose Ketamine Infusions on the Cardiovascular Response: A Retrospective Analysis.^
Background: Low-dose ketamine infusion (LDKI) has shown effectiveness for treating acute pain associated with surgical and nonsurgical (traumatic, neuropathic, and acute cancer-related) origin as an adjuvant to opioids. The increasing use of LDKI as an opioid-sparing agent in multimodal analgesia requires a better understanding of its effects on the cardiovascular response, a known dose-dependent side effect of ketamine administration. We investigated the cardiovascular response of acute pain patients treated with LDKI. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the effect of LDKI in hemodynamic variables (blood pressure [BP] and heart rate [HR]) during LDKI analgesia for up to 48 hours of treatment in an acute pain setting. Secondary objectives were to evaluate psychomimetic effects. Study Design: Retrospective unicentric cohort design. Setting: The study was conducted at an academic university hospital. Methods: We conducted a single-center retrospective cohort analysis of adult patients who underwent LDKI to treat surgical and nonsurgical acute pain. We obtained data from the Hospital San Vicente Fundación Health Documentation System database and evaluated the medical records of 318 patients with surgical and nonsurgical pain. Patients received a 0.1 mg/kg/h ketamine infusion as part of a multimodal analgesic plan. Baseline systolic BP (SBP), diastolic BP (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP), and HR values were compared with those measured after 24 and 48 hours of treatment. Pain level and psychomimetic effects were measured at 24 and 48 hours. Cardiovascular complications and treatment duration were also recorded. Patients with a history of psychiatric, cardiovascular, or cognitive disease were excluded from the study. This study was registered in the clinicaltrials.gov database (identifier: NCT03979105). Results: No statistical differences in SBP, DBP, MAP, or HR were observed when baseline and post-LDKI treatment values were compared (P < 0.05). When comparing hemodynamic variables after exposure to LDKI in patients with and without hypertension, we did not observe statistically significant differences in mean HR, systolic arterial pressure, diastolic arterial pressure, or MAP values at 24 and 48 hours. The frequency of severe pain was reduced from 72% on day 0 to 4.4% on day 1 and 6.2% on day 2 post-LDKI. Observed psychomimetic effects were confusion 4.39%, hallucinations 2.51%, and nightmares 1.25%. No major cardiovascular events were observed. Limitations: This study was limited by its retrospective design, the lack of a comparative matching cohort, and the good general condition of the majority of patients included in the study. Conclusions: LDKI (0.1 mg/kg/h) was not associated with significant changes in baseline BP or HR. Our results suggest that as an adjuvant in multimodal analgesia for surgical and nonsurgical acute pain, LDKI has a low impact on the cardiovascular response."

There has been a revival of research that studies the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs on humans. Areas of health science have been studying their possible therapeutic benefits, and psychological measurement instruments are being developed as the studies progress. However, these instruments currently suffer criticism regarding their number and evidence of psychometric quality. This study aims to review which psychometric instruments are available to assess subjective states induced by psychedelics. We systematically searched five databases (Web of Science, Academic Search Premier, EMBASE, CINAHL and PubMed) using psychometrics and psychedelics related terms identifying studies published from 1990 to 2021. Of 857 articles generated from the systematic-search, fifteen met our criteria and were included in the review, evaluating nine instruments: MEQ, 5D-ASC, HRS, PSI, EDI, CEQ, EBI, EDI and PIQ. Eight dealing with phenomenological aspects of the psychedelic experience and one as a screening tool for psychotic or manic episode. The purpose of each instrument, the number of items in each version, the type of scale and their elaboration process were described. The number of instruments used in psychedelic research is growing steadily, but there are still many other parts of the psychedelic experience that lack measurement."
"4708","1","Efficacy of repeated intravenous esketamine in adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious depression.^
BACKGROUND: Patients with anxious major depressive disorder (MDD) are more likely to have poorer outcomes than those with non-anxious MDD. However, the effect of esketamine on adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious MDD has remained unknown. AIMS: We compared the efficacy of esketamine in adolescents with MDD and suicidal ideation, both anxious and non-anxious. METHODS: Fifty-four adolescents with anxious (n=33) and non-anxious (n=21) MDD received three infusions of esketamine 0.25 mg/kg or active-placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg) over 5 days, with routine inpatient care and treatment. Suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Multiple-sample proportional tests were used to compare the differences between groups on treatment outcomes 24 hours after the final infusion (day 6, primacy efficacy endpoint) and throughout the 4-week post-treatment (days 12, 19 and 33). RESULTS: In subjects who received esketamine, a greater number of patients in the non-anxious group than the anxious group achieved antisuicidal remission on day 6 (72.7% vs 18.8%, p=0.015) and day 12 (90.9% vs 43.8%, p=0.013), and the non-anxious group had a higher antidepressant remission rate compared with the anxious group on day 33 (72.7% vs 26.7%, p=0.045). No significant differences in treatment outcomes were observed between the anxious and non-anxious groups at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: Three infusions of esketamine as an adjunct to routine inpatient care and treatment had a greater immediate post-treatment antisuicidal effect in adolescents with non-anxious MDD than in those with anxious MDD; however, this benefit was temporary and was not maintained over time.

"3689","1","Intraoperative ketamine administration to prevent delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive complications are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Ketamine has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects in various settings. This systematic review evaluates the effects of intraoperative ketamine administration on postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). METHODS: Medline, Embase and Central were searched to 4 March 2018 without date or language restrictions. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intraoperative ketamine administration versus no intervention in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD. Non-cognitive adverse events, mortality and length of stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence (GRADE approach) was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration. Risk ratios were calculated for binary outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. We planned to explore the effects of age, specific anaesthesia regimen, depth of anaesthesia and intraoperative haemodynamic events through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included. The incidence of postoperative delirium did not differ between groups (4 trials, 557 patients, RR 0.83, 95% CI [0.25, 2.80]), but patients receiving ketamine seemed at lower risk of POCD (3 trials, 163 patients, RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15, 0.73]). However, both analyses presented limitations. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was deemed low (postoperative delirium) and very low (POCD). CONCLUSION: The effect of ketamine on postoperative delirium remains unclear but its administration may offer some protection towards POCD. Large, well-designed randomised trials are urgently needed to further clarify the efficacy of ketamine on neurocognitive outcomes."
"9484","1","Replication of ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression: a randomized controlled add-on trial.^
BACKGROUND: Currently, no pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression exist that exert rapid (within hours) antidepressant or antisuicidal effects. We previously reported that intravenous administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The present study sought to replicate this finding in an independent sample. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 15 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar I or II depression maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, which was used to rate overall depressive symptoms at baseline; at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes postinfusion; and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postinfusion. RESULTS: Within 40 minutes, depressive symptoms, as well as suicidal ideation, significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo (d = .89, 95% confidence interval = .61-1.16, and .98, 95% confidence interval = .64-1.33, respectively); this improvement remained significant through day 3. Seventy-nine percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 0% responded to placebo at some point during the trial. The most common side effect was dissociative symptoms, which occurred only at the 40-minute time point. CONCLUSIONS: This study replicated our previous finding that patients with bipolar depression who received a single ketamine infusion experienced a rapid and robust antidepressant response. In addition, we found that ketamine rapidly improved suicidal ideation in these patients."
"5458","0","(+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine ('Ecstasy')-induced serotonin neurotoxicity: clinical studies.^
(+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') is a brain serotonergic neurotoxin in experimental animals, including nonhuman primates. It is also an increasingly popular recreational drug of abuse, and doses of MDMA that are used recreationally overlap with those that produce serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxicity in animals. Studies in human MDMA users probing for evidence of brain serotonergic neurotoxicity indicate that some MDMA users may incur MDMA-related 5-HT neural injury and, possibly, functional sequelae. In particular, MDMA users have selective decrements in cerebrospinal fluid 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid and brain 5-HT transporters, similar to nonhuman primates with documented MDMA-induced neurotoxicity. Functional abnormalities seen in MDMA users that may be related to 5- HT injury include cognitive deficits, altered sleep architecture, altered neuroendocrine function, altered behavioral responses to 5-HT selective drugs, and increased impulsivity. Additional studies in animals, as well as longitudinal and epidemiological studies in MDMA users, are required to confirm and extend the present data, and to determine whether MDMA users are at increased risk for developing neuropsychiatric illness as they age."
"2361","0","Chronic cocaine but not chronic amphetamine use is associated with perseverative responding in humans.^
Rationale Chronic drug use has been associated with increased impulsivity and maladaptive behaviour, but the underlying mechanisms of this impairment remain unclear. We investigated the ability to adapt behaviour according to changes in reward contingencies, using a probabilistic reversal-learning task, in chronic drug users and controls. Materials and methods Five groups were compared: chronic amphetamine users (n = 30); chronic cocaine users (n = 27); chronic opiate users (n = 42); former drug users of psychostimulants and opiates (n = 26); and healthy non-drug-taking control volunteers (n = 25). Participants had to make a forced choice between two alternative stimuli on each trial to acquire a stimulus-reward association on the basis of degraded feedback and subsequently to reverse their responses when the reward contingencies changed. Results Chronic cocaine users demonstrated little behavioural change in response to the change in reward contingencies, as reflected by perseverative responding to the previously rewarded stimulus. Perseverative responding was observed in cocaine users regardless of whether they completed the reversal stage successfully. Task performance in chronic users of amphetamines and opiates, as well as in former drug users, was not measurably impaired. Conclusion Our findings provide convincing evidence for response perseveration in cocaine users during probabilistic reversal-learning. Pharmacological differences between amphetamine and cocaine, in particular their respective effects on the 5-HT system, may account for the divergent task performance between the two psychostimulant user groups. The inability to reverse responses according to changes in reinforcement contingencies may underlie the maladaptive behaviour patterns observed in chronic cocaine users but not in chronic users of amphetamines or opiates."
"1792","1","Chronic ecstasy (MDMA) use is associated with deficits in task-switching but not inhibition or memory updating executive functions.^
The study aimed to establish whether prior ecstasy (MDMA) use caused impairments in tasks which targeted specific executive functions and whether the magnitude of impairments were correlated with the level of drug use. Subjects who had used ecstasy and cannabis (N = 33), subjects who had used cannabis but not ecstasy (N = 17) and subjects who had used neither drug (N = 18) were tested on a standard and modified form of the Stroop Colour-Word test to look for impairments in inhibition and in task-switching, respectively. A Keep Track Task was used to assess working memory updating ability. Ecstasy users, but neither of the other groups were significantly impaired (slower reaction times) on the task-switching version of the Stroop test (p < .05), but not on the standard version or on the Keep Track Task. Regression analysis showed a significant correlation between level of lifetime ecstasy use and magnitude of the switching-impairment. The findings are interpreted in line with recent theoretical views which regard executive function as composed of multiple independent cognitive components such as inhibition, switching and memory updating, only some of which may be affected by drug use or other factors. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"1551","1","Acute effects of MDMA on autonomic cardiac activity and their relation to subjective prosocial and stimulant effects.^
MDMA is a stimulant with unique ""prosocial"" effects, the physiological and pharmacological mechanisms of which are unknown. Here, we examine the relationship of measures of parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous system activity to the prosocial effects of MDMA. Parasympathetic activity was measured using respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) and sympathetic activity using pre-ejection period (PEP). Over three sessions, 33 healthy volunteers received placebo, 0.75 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg MDMA under counterbalanced, double-blind conditions, while we measured subjective feelings, RSA, and PEP. RSA and PEP data were available for 26 and 21 participants, respectively. MDMA increased prosocial and stimulated feelings, decreased RSA, and decreased PEP. At 1.5 mg/kg, subjective prosocial effects correlated with stimulated feelings and PEP, but not RSA. This suggests sympathetic, rather than parasympathetic, effects relate to the prosocial effects of MDMA."
"6879","1","Microdosing as a Response to the Meaning Crisis: A Qualitative Analysis.^
The use of psychedelic substances in both humanistic and mainstream clinical research has been increasing in the last decade. In particular, the practice of microdosing-ingesting sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics-has been increasing in popularity, but large-scale qualitative analyses are still uncommon. This study attempted to recognize emergent themes in qualitative reports regarding the experience of microdosing to enrich the theoretical landscape in psychedelic research and propose future research directions for both basic and clinical research. Participants were people who reported microdosing at least once in the last year; they described their experiences using an online survey. Data from 118 informative responses suggested four main emergent themes: reasons for microdosing, the practice of microdosing itself, outcomes linked to microdosing, and meta-commentary about microdosing. We use meaning-making theory and propose that, even at low doses, psychedelic substances can provide a sense of meaning. Our results suggest that many of the reported benefits occur regardless of motivation to microdose and are likely due to the enhanced psychological flexibility and a sense of connectedness made possible due to the use of psychedelics. Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments are required to substantiate these reports."
"422","1","Psychedelic use is associated with reduced daily opioid use among people who use illicit drugs in a Canadian setting.^
BACKGROUND: Research into the therapeutic and naturalistic uses of psychedelics for improving outcomes related to mental health disorders has generated increasing interest in recent years. While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD). METHODS: Data (2006-2018) were drawn from three harmonized prospective cohorts of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM) to estimate the independent association between psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use. RESULTS: Among 3813 PWUD at baseline, 1093 (29%) reported daily use of illicit opioids and 229 (6%) reported psychedelic use in the past six months. Over study follow-up after adjusting for a range of potential confounders, psychedelic use remained independently associated with a significantly reduced odds of subsequent daily opioid use (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.45; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.29 to 0.70). CONCLUSION: While confirmation in other settings is required, these findings align with growing evidence that psychedelic use may be associated with detectable reductions in subsequent substance use including illicit opioid use."
"502","1","Neuropsychological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) in recreational users.^
While neuropsychological studies on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) users have been emerging, results have been inconsistent, possibly due to methodological issues. The current study examined the performance of 22 recreational MDMA users compared to 28 age, education, and IQ comparable normal control subjects on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Results revealed no significant differences in cognitive functioning between the MDMA users and normal controls. However, greater use of MDMA was associated with poorer scores on several measures of nonverbal memory, and greater frequency users (> or = 50 times) evidenced significantly lower scores on 2 of 3 nonverbal memory tests compared to lesser frequency users (< 50 times). Our results suggest that a subgroup of MDMA patients, specifically heavy MDMA users, evidence declines in nonverbal (visual) memory, however, other cognitive areas appear to be spared."
"8706","1","The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating, neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^
Recently, much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) in sensory gating, such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential (ERP). Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores ""thinking disorder"" and ""withdrawal/retardation"" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further."
"2825","1","Ketamine-based anesthesia improves electroconvulsive therapy outcomes: a randomized-controlled study.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating condition that can be challenging to treat. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is currently the therapeutic gold standard for treatment-resistant MDD. We tested our hypothesis that ketamine-based anesthesia for ECT results in superior improvement in treatment-resistant MDD outcomes compared with propofol-based anesthesia. METHODS: Patients with treatment-resistant MDD were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with assignment to ketamine- or propofol-based anesthesia arms. Using a modified intention-to-treat analysis, we compared the median number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50% reduction (primary outcome) and a score ≤ 10 (secondary outcome) on the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) between anesthesia groups. RESULTS: The study was terminated as significant results were found after the first planned interim analysis with 12 patients in each of the ketamine (intervention) and propofol (control) groups. All ketamine patients achieved at least a 50% MADRS reduction after a median of two ECT treatments whereas ten propofol patients (83%) achieved the same outcome after a median of four ECT treatments. All ketamine patients and seven propofol patients (58%) achieved MDD remission (MADRS ≤ 10). Log rank tests showed that both time-to-50% reduction and remission differed significantly between groups. Adverse events and recovery time were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this early-terminated small-sized study, ketamine-based anesthesia compared with propofol-based anesthesia provided response and remission after fewer ECT sessions.

"2151","1","Antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of ayahuasca: A systematic literature review of animal and human studies.^
Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review of animal and human studies reporting anxiolytic or antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or some of its isolated alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline). Methods: Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection. Results: Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression. Conclusion: Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated."
"403","1","Personality Traits in Former Spanish Substance Users Recovered with Ayahuasca.^
Ayahuasca is a psychoactive brew that contains N,N-dimethyltryptamine and monoamine oxidase-inhibiting alkaloids. It is originally from the Amazon rainforest, but since the 1990s it has expanded worldwide. The compound is used in different religious, spiritual, and therapeutic settings. One of its common applications is for the treatment of addiction. The current study is an assessment of the impact of ayahuasca on personality traits in former substance users from Catalonia and surrounding areas. When compared with a control group, the ayahuasca group had statistically significantly higher scores in the dimensions Novelty Seeking and Self-Transcendence, and in the traits Attachment, Impulsivity, Compassion, and Spiritual Acceptance. Results suggest that recovery could be related less to a reduction of Impulsivity and Novelty Seeking, main features of substance use disorder (SUD), and more to an increase of Character dimensions and traits, especially Self-Transcendence and Cooperativeness. Those changes could be triggered by self-reflective, prosocial, and transcendental ayahuasca ritual experiences, which in the qualitative part of the research were described by the participants as being of great importance for their recovery, helping with the reconstruction of personal goals, gratifications, social bonds, and the general life's projection."
"9400","1","Symptoms of ecstasy dependence and correlation with psychopathology in Taiwanese adolescents.^
This study aimed at examining the spectrum and frequency of symptoms of ecstasy dependence and their correlation with psychopathology by controlling polysubstance use in Taiwanese adolescents. Two hundred adolescents who had used ecstasy were recruited into this study. Symptoms of ecstasy dependence that had occurred in the preceding year were determined by an interview using the Kiddie epidemiologic version of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia. The adolescents' psychopathology was examined using the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised Scale. The proportion of participants who had symptoms of ecstasy dependence was calculated. The association between the number of symptoms of ecstasy dependence and psychopathology was examined by using stepwise multiple regression analysis. The results indicated that ""continuing ecstasy use despite knowledge of having a problem related to ecstasy use,"" ""spending a great deal of time in activities related to ecstasy use or to recover from its effects,"" and ""ecstasy use tolerance"" were the 3 most prevalent symptoms of dependence, and ""withdrawal"" was the symptom least reported. Heavy ecstasy use led to more symptoms of ecstasy dependence than light use. Symptoms of ecstasy dependence independently increased the risk of severe psychopathology after controlling the effects of polysubstance use. The results of this study indicated that adolescents were aware of the adverse effects of ecstasy use and that repeated ecstasy use would result in dependence on it. Screening the dependence symptoms of adolescent ecstasy users may help clinicians more thoroughly understand their psychopathology. © 2007 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."

The authors found that striatal levels of serotonin and those of its metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid were severely depleted by 50 to 80% in brain of a chronic user of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) whereas concentrations of dopamine were within the normal control range. Our data suggest that MDMA exposure in the human can cause decreased tissue stores of serotonin and therefore some of the behavioral effects of this drug of abuse could be caused by massive release and depletion of brain serotonin."

"1095","1","Quantitation of N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and its major metabolites in human plasma by high-performance liquid chromatography and fluorescence detection.^
A HPLC method has been developed for the analogue of Ecstasy MDE and its major metabolites N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HME) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) in human plasma. In the course of our investigations we found that the methylenedioxyamphetamines and HME exhibit fluorescence at 322 nm. Therefore the detection could be carried out with a fluorescence (FL) detector. Solid-phase extraction was used for sample preparation and yielded high recovery rates greater than 95%. The limit of quantitation for MDE and its metabolites in the extracts was between 1.5 and 8.9 ng/ml and the method standard deviations were less than 5%. This sensitive, rapid and reliable analytical method has been used successfully in the quantitation of the substances in plasma samples obtained from 14 volunteers in two clinical studies after p.o. administration of 100 to 140 mg MDE*HCI. The maximum plasma concentrations were 235-465 ng/ml (MDE), 67-673 ng/ml (HME) and 7-33 ng/ml (MDA), respectively. Pharmacokinetic parameters have been investigated using the plasma concentration curves."
"6685","0","Antidepressant, anxiolytic and procognitive effects of subacute and chronic ketamine in the chronic mild stress model of depression.^
Ketamine is the prototype of a new generation of antidepressant drugs, which is reported in clinical studies to be effective in treatment-resistant patients, with an effect that appears within hours and lasts for a few days. Chronic mild stress (CMS) is a well-established and widely used animal model of depression, in which anhedonia, anxiogenesis and cognitive dysfunction can be observed reliably. Studies using acute or brief ketamine treatment following withdrawal from CMS have replicated the clinical finding of a rapid onset of antidepressant action. However, there have been no CMS studies of chronic daily ketamine treatment or continued stress following ketamine treatment, which would have greater translational potential in relation to the long-term maintenance of antidepressant effects. Wistar rats were drug treated following an initial 2 weeks of CMS exposure, which continued alongside daily drug treatment. A first experiment tested a range of chronic (5 weeks) ketamine doses (5–30 mg/kg); a second compared the effects of subacute (3–5 days) and chronic (5 weeks) treatment. CMS-induced anhedonic, anxiogenic and dyscognitive effects, as measured, respectively, by decreased sucrose intake, avoidance of open arms in the elevated plus maze and loss of discrimination in the novel object recognition test. A sustained antidepressant-like effect of ketamine in the sucrose intake test was observed in both experiments, with an onset at around 1 week, faster than imipramine, and an optimum dose of 10 mg/kg. Anxiogenic and dyscognitive effects of CMS, in the elevated plus maze and novel object recognition test, respectively, were fully reversed by both subacute and chronic ketamine treatment. Daily treatment with ketamine in the CMS model causes sustained long-term antidepressant, anxiolytic and procognitive effects. The demonstration of a procognitive effect of ketamine may have particular translational value. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8798","1","Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library. RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted."
"5690","1","MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.^
This multi-site, randomized, double-blind, confirmatory phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) versus placebo with identical therapy in participants with moderate to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n = 53) or placebo with therapy (n = 51). Overall, 26.9% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95% confidence interval (CI)) was -23.7 (-26.94, -20.44) for MDMA-AT versus -14.8 (-18.28, -11.28) for placebo with therapy (P < 0.001, d = 0.7). LS mean change in SDS score (95% CI) was -3.3 (-4.03, -2.60) for MDMA-AT versus -2.1 (-2.89, -1.33) for placebo with therapy (P = 0.03, d = 0.4). Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n = 5 (9.4%); placebo with therapy, n = 2 (3.9%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs. These data suggest that MDMA-AT reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD and was generally well tolerated.

"5110","0","Impulsivity in Hong Kong-Chinese club-drug users.^
To investigate the relationship between personality, club-drug use and high-risk drug-related behaviour, 360 club-drug users and 303 non-drug users in Hong Kong were assessed on measures of two impulsivity dimensions, reward drive and rash impulsivity, and a related trait of punishment sensitivity. The most frequently used drugs were ketamine, ecstasy, and cannabis, with the majority of participants using two or more drugs on any one occasion. Club-drug users were more rash-impulsive and reward-driven, and less punishment-sensitive than non-drug users (p < 0.001). Rash impulsivity, but not reward drive or punishment sensitivity, was significantly (p < 0.001) associated with risky drug-related behaviour. There was no association between any personality traits and preferred drug. These findings suggest that, while those who use club drugs are generally more impulsive and less punishment-sensitive, some discrete facets of impulsivity are associated with differing patterns of drug-use behaviour. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"5759","1","Updating of working memory in ecstasy polydrug users: Findings from fNIRS.^
Aims/Objectives: Cognitive deficits are now well documented in ecstasy (MDMA) users with type and relative demand of task emerging as important factors. The updating component of executive processes appears to be particularly affected. The study reported here used functional near infrared spectroscopy imaging to investigate changes in cortical haemodynamics during memory updating. Method: Twenty ecstasy users and 20 non-users completed verbal and spatial memory updating tasks and brain blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Results: There was no interaction between group and difficulty on the updating tasks, though there was a significant main effect of difficulty on both tasks. The effects of group approached significance on the verbal updating task. There were significant differences in blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change at optodes centred over the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with ecstasy users showing greater blood oxygenation than the other groups. Discussion: The lack of a behavioural difference on both tasks but presence of blood oxygenation and deoxygenation changes in letter updating provides support for the notion that ecstasy-polydrug users are investing more effort to achieve the same behavioural output. Total lifetime dose was high, and recency of use was significantly related to most changes, suggesting that heavy and recent use may be particularly detrimental."
"3315","0","Recent advances in the neuropsychopharmacology of serotonergic hallucinogens.^
Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline, are somewhat enigmatic substances. Although these drugs are derived from multiple chemical families, they all produce remarkably similar effects in animals and humans, and they show cross-tolerance. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the primary site of hallucinogen action. The 5-HT2A receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of hallucinogens in human subjects, as well as in animal behavioral paradigms such as drug discrimination, head twitch response, prepulse inhibition of startle, exploratory behavior, and interval timing. Many recent clinical trials have yielded important new findings regarding the psychopharmacology of these substances. Furthermore, the use of modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques is beginning to help unravel how hallucinogens work in the brain. Evidence is also emerging that hallucinogens may possess therapeutic efficacy."
"625","1","Facing death, returning to life: A qualitative analysis of MDMA-assisted therapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness.^
Anxiety associated with life-threatening illness (LTI) is a pervasive mental health issue with a wide impact. A spectrum of traditional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are available, but offer varying success in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. We explore a novel therapy for this condition by assessing prominent thematic elements from participant narrative accounts of a pilot phase 2 clinical trial of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-Assisted Therapy (MDMA-AT) for treating anxiety associated with LTI. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of adult participants 3 months following completion of this trial. This qualitative analysis sought to complement, clarify, and expand upon the quantitative findings obtained from the clinical trial to further understand the process and outcomes of the treatment. Interviews were coded and analyzed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodological framework. Participants described in detail their experiences from before, during and after the trial, which were analyzed and categorized into thematic clusters. Specifically, participants explored what they felt were important elements of the therapeutic process including processing trauma and grief, exploring mystical and existential experiences, engaging with the present moment with reduced physiological activation, and facing illness and existential fears. Outcomes of the treatment included increased ability to cope with LTI, reduced psychological symptoms, improved vitality and quality of life, and feeling more resourced. Participant narratives also showed a reconnection to life and greater emotional resilience in response to trauma and medical relapse. These findings are compared to similar treatments for the same indication. Limitations and challenges encountered in conducting this study are discussed along with implications for theory and clinical treatment."
"7463","1","Psilocybin Assisted Therapy for Treatment-Resistant Depression: a Phase II, Randomized, Feasibility Study.^
Background: Emerging preliminary evidence suggests that psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be associated with rapid, robust and potentially enduring antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD). Given several challenging regulatory and logistical barriers, there have been no investigator‐initiated psilocybin trials in Canada for several decades. Our study aimed to assess the feasibility, safety, and efficacy of single and repeat doses of psilocybin (25 mg) in persons with treatment‐resistant depression (including both MDD and bipolar II disorder). The primary objective was to evaluate the feasibility of repeated high‐doses of psilocybin in adults with treatment‐resistant depression. The secondary objectives were to assess the antidepressant efficacy and tolerability of psilocybin‐assisted therapy in a real‐world, complex patient population with minimal exclusion criteria and no upper limit for degree of treatment resistance. Exploratory objectives of this pilot trial were to determine the effects of psilocybin on quality of life, wellbeing, functioning, disability, cognitive function, anxiety, anhedonia and mystical experiences. Methods: In this phase 2 randomized, wait‐list controlled clinical trial, participants were randomized to immediate (n = 15) or delayed treatment (n = 15). Participants in the delayed treatment group (waitlist control condition) waited two weeks after enrolment before commencing the study interventions. The study intervention combines up to three high dose of oral synthetic psilocybin (25 mg; supplied by Usona) with psychotherapy over a 6‐month period. With considerations for costeffectiveness and scalability in mind, an ultra‐brief four‐session therapy model was evaluated (i.e., four sessions total for each psilocybin dose, including preparation, dosing and integration sessions). Within the four‐session model, psychotherapy consists of one 2 hour preparatory session (one week before dosing session), one 6‐8 hour supportive psilocybin dosing session and two integration therapy sessions (2 hours each session; one day after and one week after the dosing session). Participants received a single 25 mg dose of psilocybin with accompanying psychotherapy and were assessed weekly for six weeks and then biweekly for 18 weeks. Participants who responded and then relapsed could receive up to two repeated doses (e.g., maximum of three doses total, including first dose) of psilocybin over the course of the 6‐month trial. Eligibility Criteria: Male and female outpatients, between the ages of 18 and 70, who met DSM‐5‐defined criteria for a current major depressive episode as part of major depressive or bipolar II disorder. Participants were required to have previously failed two or more first‐line treatments with no upper limit to failed treatment trials. Personal and family history of psychosis, active suicidality requiring admission and moderate/severe substance use disorders were key exclusion criteria. Personality disorders, passive suicidality and history of hypomania were NOT exclusion criteria. Primary Outcome: The primary outcome of the study was feasibility. Feasibility was judged based on meeting regulatory requirements, recruitment, retention, safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy. This trial received Health Canada and research ethics board approval and was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05029466. Results: At the time of abstract submission, 22/30 participants (100% MDD to date) were enrolled and randomized with the trial to be completed by December 2022 (final trial results to be presented at ACNP). To date, feasibility results have been positive with all federal and local regulatory requirements met, rapid recruitment (159 patients referred for screening in first 6 weeks) and adequate retention (21/22 retained to primary endpoint). The safety and tolerability profile was positive, with zero serious adverse events (SAEs), zero suicide attempts, one dropout due to acute psychedelic effects, no psychedelic effects pers sting past 12 hours and no emergency medications required during dosing sessions. 19/22 requested to receive a second dose believing benefits outweighed side effects. Preliminary efficacy testing was positive with statistically and clinically significant antidepressant effects observed with psilocybin treatment, as measured by the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) (p < 0.01 at all time points compared to baseline and wait list control). Significant reductions of suicidal thoughts and anxiety were also observed with subjective improvements in overall function, quality of life and wellbeing. Mean MADRS scores reduced by 8.9 points (SD = 7) 2‐weeks after the first psilocybin dose (primary endpoint), as compared to 3.7 (5.1) in the waitlist control group, with a significant between group difference (p < 0.01). Greater reductions were observed 2‐weeks after the second dosing session with an overall mean MADRS reduction of 17.5 (7.9), significantly greater than the MADRS reduction with the first dose (p < 0.01). Analysis of third dose effects are still pending. Conclusions: Interim results supported feasibility with adequate recruitment, retention and safety. Preliminary efficacy results suggest that the ultra‐brief psilocybin‐assisted therapy intervention was beneficial in an ultra‐refractory patient population. Two‐doses were associated with greater reduction in depressive symptoms than a single dosing session."

"8198","1","Assessment of ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter in humans with positron emission tomography.^
Background: Comprehensive description of ketamine’s molecular binding profile becomes increasingly pressing as use in real-life patient cohorts widens. Animal studies attribute a significant role in the substance’s antidepressant effects to the serotonergic system. The serotonin transporter is a highly relevant target in this context, because it is central to depressive pathophysiology and treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding in vivo in humans. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects were assessed twice using [¹¹C]DASB positron emission tomography. A total of 0.50 mg/kg bodyweight ketamine was administered once i.v. prior to the second positron emission tomography scan. Ketamine plasma levels were determined during positron emission tomography. Serotonin transporter nondisplaceable binding potential was computed using a reference region model, and occupancy was calculated for 4 serotonin transporter-rich regions (caudate, putamen, thalamus, midbrain) and a whole-brain region of interest. Results: After administration of the routine antidepressant dose, ketamine showed < 10% occupancy of the serotonin transporter, which is within the test-retest variability of [¹¹C]DASB. A positive correlation between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy was shown. Conclusions: Measurable occupancy of the serotonin transporter was not detectable after administration of an antidepressant dose of ketamine. This might suggest that ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter is unlikely to be a primary antidepressant mechanism at routine antidepressant doses, as substances that facilitate antidepressant effects via serotonin transporter binding (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) show 70% to 80% occupancy. Administration of high-dose ketamine is widening. Based on the positive relationship we find between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy, there is a need for investigation of ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding at higher doses.

"3779","1","Effects of the α₂-adrenergic agonist clonidine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in healthy volunteers.^
The mechanism of action of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) involves the carrier-mediated and potentially vesicular release of monoamines. We assessed the effects of the sympatholytic α₂-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine (150 μg p.o.), which inhibits the neuronal vesicular release of norepinephrine, on the cardiovascular and psychotropic response to MDMA (125 mg p.o.) in 16 healthy subjects. The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design with four experimental sessions. The administration of clonidine 1 h before MDMA reduced the MDMA-induced increases in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and blood pressure but only to the extent that clonidine lowered norepinephrine levels and blood pressure compared with placebo. Thus, no interaction was found between the cardiovascular effects of the two drugs. Clonidine did not affect the psychotropic effects or pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The lack of an interaction of the effects of clonidine and MDMA indicates that vesicular release of norepinephrine, which is inhibited by clonidine, does not critically contribute to the effects of MDMA in humans. Although clonidine may be used in the treatment of stimulant-induced hypertensive reactions, the present findings do not support a role for α₂-adrenergic receptor agonists in the prevention of psychostimulant dependence."
"2206","0","Augmenting the Treatment of PTSD with Ketamine—a Review.^
Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 6.1% in the general adult population. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of PTSD suggest the use of trauma-focused psychotherapies such as prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). As a second-level intervention, these guidelines suggest the use of psychotropic medications, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). To date, however, studies have shown that both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments have limited efficacy, with remission rates around 40–70% and dropout rates of up to 50%. This paper reviews a new and emerging treatment approach of medication-augmented psychotherapy for PTSD, with an emphasis on augmenting prolonged exposure therapy (PE) with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion. Based on animal and human research on fear extinction and memory reconsolidation, neurobiological changes that emerge following a ketamine infusion can enhance learning and thus benefit exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD. Summary: Medication-augmented exposure-based psychotherapies represent a promising direction for the treatment of PTSD, with some positive results in small-scale studies. More studies (phase 2 and 3) should be performed to determine if this multimodal treatment approach may help mitigate PTSD symptoms in trauma-exposed individuals who do not respond to standard monotherapeutic approaches. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."
"8064","1","Comparison of postoperative delirium within 24 hours between ketamine and propofol infusion during cardiopulmonary bypass machine: A randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Postoperative delirium (POD) is a common complication in cardiac surgery especially in elderly population which can lead to a delay of weaning from ventilator and extubation. Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB)-induced inflammation is related to POD. Anti-inflammatory effect of anesthetic agent might attenuate POD. AIMS: The present study was primarily aimed to compare within-24-h POD between ketamine-based anesthesia and propofol-based anesthesia during CPB. The secondary objective was to identify risk factors associated with within-24-h POD. SETTING AND DESIGN: Our study was a randomized controlled trial in patients undergoing cardiac surgery with CPB. Enrolling patients were aged >65 years, and able to comprehensive communication. Exclusion criteria were aortic surgery, cognitive disorders, cerebrovascular and carotid disease, and positive result of preoperative CAM-ICU. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to group Ketamine infusion of 1 mg/kg/h and group Propofol infusion of 1.5-6 mg/kg/h during CPB. POD was evaluated by validated Thai version CAM-ICU at 8-24 hour after ICU arrival. STATISTICS: Chi-square, Fisher exact and t-test tests, univariate analysis and multivariate logistic regression were utilized. Results: Total 82 patients entered this study and 64 patients remained after exclusion (Group Ketamine = 32 and Group Propofol = 32). Within-24-h POD were 31.25% and 56.25% (P = 0.04) and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were 71.45 and 65.53 mmHg (P = 0.01) respectively in Ketamine and Propofol group. Postoperative leukocytosis was a significant risk to POD (adjusted OR 124.5). CONCLUSION: With limitations of the study, prevention of 24-h POD in general by ketamine was inconclusive. In comparison with propofol, ketamine leaded to less events of 24-h POD and kept higher MAP. Severity of postoperative inflammation was a significant prediction of 24-h POD."

Background: Ecstasy/MDMA has been one of the most prevalent party drugs for decades, and powder ecstasy recently increased in popularity. We examined trends in use to determine who to best target for prevention and harm reduction. Methods: Secondary analysis of the 2007–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative probability sample, was conducted. Linear trends in past-year ecstasy use and trends in demographic and other past-year substance use characteristics among ecstasy users were examined among participants ages 12–34 (N = 332,560). Results: Past-year prevalence of ecstasy use was stable across years at 2% (P = 0.693). Over time, the proportion of ecstasy users with a college degree increased from 11.5% in 2007/08 to 24.5% in 2013/14 (P < 0.001). The proportion of users who were age 12–17 decreased, as did proportions of users who are non-Hispanic black, and reported income <$20,000/year (Ps < 0.001). Prevalence of past-year use of marijuana, LSD, ketamine, and DMT/AMT/Foxy increased among ecstasy users (Ps < 0.05); DMT/AMT/Foxy use increased more than four-fold from 2.1% in 2007/08 to 8.7% in 2013/14. Perception of great risk associated with LSD use decreased among users and ease of obtaining LSD increased (Ps < 0.05). Past-year use of 5 or more other substances also increased over time (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Ecstasy use in the US appears to be increasing among those with college degrees and use of other substances among ecstasy users is growing—particularly use of otherwise rare substances such as tryptamines. Results inform prevention and harm reduction strategies in this increasingly shifting group of ecstasy users."
"603","1","Efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of depressive symptoms in palliative care: A systematic review.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine has a fast onset of action that may offer a paradigm change for depression management at the end of life. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of ketamine in depression treatment within a broad palliative care concept. METHODS: We searched seven databases and included studies on the safety and efficacy of ketamine for depression treatment in patients diagnosed with any life-threatening disease. We also conducted a narrative review of the evidence. RESULTS: Among 2,252 screened titles and abstracts, we included 32 studies in our final synthesis: 14 case reports, two case series, two quasi-experimental studies, and seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs), as well as data from three unpublished clinical trials and seven cases from four larger case series. Most case reports reported a robust effect; however, the larger studies reported conflicting findings. Five RCTs reported positive outcomes; however, four of them were focused on a perioperative setting. Two negative studies did not primarily focus on depression and did not apply severity cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Although ketamine is generally safe and potentially useful, its efficacy in palliative care settings remains unclear. It may be a reasonable alternative for perioperative depression in oncological patients."

This paper presents original research on prevalence, user characteristics and effect profile of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent hallucinogenic which acts primarily through the serotonergic system. Data were obtained from the Global Drug Survey (an anonymous online survey of people, many of whom have used drugs) conducted between November and December 2012 with 22,289 responses. Lifetime prevalence of DMT use was 8.9% (n=1980) and past year prevalence use was 5.0% (n=1123). We explored the effect profile of DMT in 472 participants who identified DMT as the last new drug they had tried for the first time and compared it with ratings provided by other respondents on psilocybin (magic mushrooms), LSD and ketamine. DMT was most often smoked and offered a strong, intense, short-lived psychedelic high with relatively few negative effects or ""come down"". It had a larger proportion of new users compared with the other substances (24%), suggesting its popularity may increase. Overall, DMT seems to have a very desirable effect profile indicating a high abuse liability that maybe offset by a low urge to use more. © The Author(s) 2013."

The incidence of depression among adolescents has been rapidly increasing in recent years. Environmental and genetic factors have been identified as important risk factors for adolescent depression. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of adolescent depression that are triggered by these risk factors are not well understood. Clinical and preclinical studies have focused more on adult depression, and differences in depressive symptoms between adolescents and adults make it difficult to adequately diagnose and treat adolescent depression. Brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is known to play a critical role in the pathophysiology of many psychiatric disorders, including depression. However, there are still few studies on adolescent depression. Therefore, in this review paper, the causes and treatment of adolescent depression and the function of BDNF are investigated."
"559","0","Assessing measures of suicidal ideation in clinical trials with a rapid-acting antidepressant.^
Rapid reduction of suicidal thoughts is critical for treating suicidal patients. Clinical trials evaluating these treatments require appropriate measurement. Key methodological issues include: 1) the use of single or multi-item assessments, and 2) evaluating whether suicidal ideation measures can track rapid change over time. The current study presents data from two randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trials evaluating ketamine in individuals with treatment-resistant depression (n = 60). Participants were assessed for suicidal thoughts using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D), Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI) at eight time points over three days. Assessments were compared using correlational analyses and effect sizes at 230 min and three days after ketamine infusion. Linear mixed models evaluated change in ideation across all time points. The HAM-D and MADRS suicide items demonstrated correlations of r > .80 with the first five items of the SSI (SSI5). On linear mixed models, an effect for ketamine was found for the HAM-D, MADRS, BDI items, and SSI5 (p < .001), but not for the full SSI (p = .88), which suggests a limited ability to assess change over time in patients with low levels of suicidal thoughts. Taken together, the results suggest that repeated suicidal assessments over minutes to days appear to detect improvement in suicidal thoughts after ketamine infusion compared to placebo. The MADRS suicide item, BDI suicide item, and SSI5 may be particularly sensitive to rapid changes in suicidal thoughts. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"2807","1","Prospective memory deficits in illicit polydrug users are associated with the average long-term typical dose of ecstasy typically consumed in a single session.^
Rationale: Neuroimaging evidence suggests that ecstasy-related reductions in SERT densities relate more closely to the number of tablets typically consumed per session rather than estimated total lifetime use. To better understand the basis of drug related deficits in prospective memory (p.m.) we explored the association between p.m. and average long-term typical dose and long-term frequency of use. Method: Study 1: Sixty-five ecstasy/polydrug users and 85 nonecstasy users completed an event-based, a short-term and a long-term time-based p.m. task. Study 2: Study 1 data were merged with outcomes on the same p.m. measures from a previous study creating a combined sample of 103 ecstasy/polydrug users, 38 cannabis-only users, and 65 nonusers of illicit drugs. Results: Study 1: Ecstasy/polydrug users had significant impairments on all p.m. outcomes compared with nonecstasy users. Study 2: Ecstasy/polydrug users were impaired in event-based p.m. compared with both other groups and in long-term time-based p.m. compared with nonillicit drug users. Both drug using groups did worse on the short-term time-based p.m. task compared with nonusers. Higher long-term average typical dose of ecstasy was associated with poorer performance on the event and short-term time-based p.m. tasks and accounted for unique variance in the two p.m. measures over and above the variance associated with cannabis and cocaine use. Conclusions: The typical ecstasy dose consumed in a single session is an important predictor of p.m. impairments with higher doses reflecting increasing tolerance giving rise to greater p.m. impairment. © 2013 American Psychological Association."
"3592","1","The rapid anti-suicidal ideation effect of ketamine: A systematic review.^
In many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years-presenting a public health crisis. Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness, usually a depressive disorder. Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA-approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks-thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [SI] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome. A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] criteria. PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline. One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post-dose. Further research is warranted into: optimal dosing strategy, including number and frequency; and long-term efficacy and safety. Ultimately, it remains to be shown that ketamine's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior."
"8240","1","MDMA-assisted psychotherapy; Inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people in the frontiers of PTSD treatment trials.^
INTRODUCTION: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people experience stigma, discrimination, trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at higher rates compared to the general population; however, TGD people have been underrepresented in PTSD research. Clinical trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy demonstrate promising safety and efficacy for the treatment of PTSD. Issues related to equitable access, power imbalances in the therapeutic relationship, and vulnerable states of consciousness occasioned by MDMA are magnified when working with people affected by structural vulnerabilities and health disparities, and community engagement in research planning and implementation is essential. To inform the inclusion and safety of TGD people in future MDMA-assisted psychotherapy research, the aims of the current study were to: characterize TGD experiences with trauma-related mental health care, assess openness of TGD people to participate in experimental PTSD research, and to gather specific feedback on protocol design for conducting MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with TGD people. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted three virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 5-6 participants each (N = 17). Eligible TGD participants had a history of receiving trauma-related mental health care. Each FGD was facilitated by two licensed clinicians who identified as TGD. Qualitative data analysis was conducted via an iterative process of identification of recurrent patterns and themes. RESULTS: We have identified several key issues TGD people face when seeking and engaging in trauma-related mental health care, including barriers to receiving adequate gender-affirming and trauma-informed mental health care and frustration with providers lacking cultural humility. Suggested amendments to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy protocols include: routine collection of trans-inclusive gender identity data, implementing an explicit gender-affirming treatment approach, ensuring a culturally safe setting, and diversifying co-therapy dyads. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of TGD voices in early conversations about emerging experimental PTSD interventions promotes equitable access, in the context of health and healthcare disparities, and helps researchers understand the needs of the community and tailor research to meet those needs. Through an ongoing conversation with the TGD community, we aim to incorporate a gender-affirming approach into existing research protocols and inform future applications of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in addressing the effects of minority stress and boosting resilience."
"2833","0","Comparison of simultaneously recorded [H215O]-PET and LORETA during cognitive and pharmacological activation.^
The complementary strengths and weaknesses of established functional brain imaging methods (high spatial, low temporal resolution) and EEG-based techniques (low spatial, high temporal resolution) make their combined use a promising avenue for studying brain processes at a more fine-grained level. However, this strategy requires a better understanding of the relationship between hemodynamic/metabolic and neuroelectric measures of brain activity. We investigated possible correspondences between cerebral blood flow (CBF) as measured by [H2O]-PET and intracerebral electric activity computed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA) from scalp-recorded multichannel EEG in healthy human subjects during cognitive and pharmacological stimulation. The two imaging modalities were compared by descriptive, correlational, and variance analyses, the latter carried out using statistical parametric mapping (SPM99). Descriptive visual comparison showed a partial overlap between the sets of active brain regions detected by the two modalities. A number of exclusively positive correlations of neuroelectric activity with regional CBF were found across the whole EEG frequency range, including slow wave activity, the latter finding being in contrast to most previous Studies Conducted in patients. Analysis of variance revealed an extensive lack of statistically significant correspondences between brain activity changes as measured by PET vs. EEG-LORETA. In general, correspondences, to the extent they were found, were dependent on experimental condition, brain region, and EEG frequency. © 2004 Wiley-Liss, Inc."

Oral treatment of phantom limb pain in five males and two females ranging in age from 25 to 78 years with subhallucinogenic doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) resulted in improvement in pain in five patients and reduction in use of analgesics. In two of the five patients improvement was striking and in the other three, pain and analgesic use were reduced moderately. LSD treatment was ineffective in two patients. Intravenous infusion or bolus injection of LSD-25, 10 ng/ml at 0.5 ml/min. resulted in facilitation of 5-HT venospasm. The findings suggest that LSD-25 facilitation of 5-HT activity occurs centrally consistent with the hypothesis of the central nature of phantom limb pain."

The 30-item revised Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) was previously developed within an online survey of mystical-type experiences occasioned by psilocybin-containing mushrooms. The rated experiences occurred on average eight years before completion of the questionnaire. The current paper validates the MEQ30 using data from experimental studies with controlled doses of psilocybin. Data were pooled and analyzed from five laboratory experiments in which participants (n=184) received a moderate to high oral dose of psilocybin (at least 20 mg/70 kg). Results of confirmatory factor analysis demonstrate the reliability and internal validity of the MEQ30. Structural equation models demonstrate the external and convergent validity of the MEQ30 by showing that latent variable scores on the MEQ30 positively predict persisting change in attitudes, behavior, and well-being attributed to experiences with psilocybin while controlling for the contribution of the participant-rated intensity of drug effects. These findings support the use of the MEQ30 as an efficient measure of individual mystical experiences. A method to score a ""complete mystical experience"" that was used in previous versions of the mystical experience questionnaire is validated in the MEQ30, and a stand-alone version of the MEQ30 is provided for use in future research."

Despite long-standing concern over the sexuaL heaLth of the popuLation there has been LittLe work undertaken in the UK investigating sexuaL risk taking and sexuaL behaviours in the context of substance use. To investigate this further, 270 non-drug treatment seeking members of the pubLic aged between 18 and 66 were administered a questionnaire containing the ALcohoL Use Disorders Identification Test (AUDIT), the Drug Abuse Screening Test (DAST), the Severity of Dependence ScaLe (SDS), the SexuaL Risks ScaLe and Attitudes toward condom use (SRSA), the SexuaL Sensation Seeking ScaLe (SSSS); the HospitaL Anxiety and Depression ScaLe (HADS), and questions pertaining to sexuaL episodes proximaL to substance use. The popuLation reported a varied history of substances and despite there not being seLf-awareness of probLematic drug use, 39.4% reported above the cut-off mark of six on the DAST. An even greater percentage (57.8%) reported a score above eight on the AUDIT indicating hazardous or harmfuL drinking behaviour. The substance most often associated with sexuaL episodes was aLcohoL, foLLowed by cannabis and ecstasy, and aLL were most frequentLy consumed in private houses. SexuaL activity after drug use was most frequentLy circumstantiaL (i.e. the individuaL hadn't taken the substance for the specific purposes of sex), and was significantLy associated with use of cannabis and ecstasy. The second most frequentLy reported association between drug use and sex was faciLitation of a sexuaL encounter (i.e. to Lower sexuaL inhibitions, increase seLf esteem and confidence), which was associated with use of aLcohoL, cannabis, cocaine and ecstasy. ALthough it was not possibLe to identify differences in subjective sexuaL changes after use of particuLar drugs, subjects reported that compared to sex after aLcohoL, sex on other drugs was more pLeasurabLe and satisfying, with a greater perception of interpersonaL contact with the partner and a greater wiLLingness to sexuaLLy experiment. However, this Latter change was not associated with changes in the type of sexuaL activity engaged in. Regression anaLysis reveaLed that the greatest subjective changes in sexuaL experiences were reported by younger participants who had ingested either ecstasy or cannabis prior to the sexuaL episode.

Objective: Whether for spiritual, recreational, or potential therapeutic use, interest in ayahuasca has grown remarkably. Ayahuasca’s main active substances are N,N-dimethyltryptamine and certain mono-amine oxidase inhibitor b-carbolines. Possible drug interactions are a major concern, and research is lacking in this area. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety of ritual ayahuasca use regarding adverse effects and risk factors. Methods: In this cross-sectional study, ayahuasca users from a religious institution answered an online questionnaire about its safety. Adverse effects, safety measures, and possible risk factors (psychiatric diagnosis and medications) were investigated. Results: The most frequent adverse effects among the 614 participants were transient gastrointestinal effects (nausea and vomiting). Fifty participants self-reported a psychiatric diagnosis (depression and anxiety were the most prevalent), and these participants experienced adverse effects more frequently. Psychiatric medication use was reported by 31 participants. No indication of increased adverse effects due to drug-drug interactions was found. Conclusion: A minority of participants reported being very negatively affected by persistent adverse effects. Psychiatric medication use while participating in ayahuasca rituals was not associated with increased adverse effects. For the most part, the institution’s practices seem sufficient to prevent exacerbated reactions. Future studies may focus on negatively affected users."
"8498","1","AUD Readmission Risk Lower With Pre-Discharge Ketamine Infusion or Naltrexone Injection.^
Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans [1], leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million inpatient admissions [2]. Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to initiate addiction recovery, and two single‐dose, adherenceindependent, pharmacologic interventions ‐ intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone ‐ are well‐suited to administer before discharge. However, their feasibility and effectiveness at reducing re‐admissions among AUD inpatients are not well established. Methods: Our open‐label pilot trial randomized participants to 1) IM naltrexone injection, 2) IV ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced‐linkage alone. Adult (age 18‐65), hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past‐year hospital encounter were recruited through an addiction consultation service at an urban, safety‐net hospital. Exclusion criteria included psychiatric instability, severe hepatic or cardiac disease, chronic or planned opioid use, and other severe substance use disorders. The primary aim was to test feasibility, and the primary clinical outcome was 30‐day, all‐cause re‐admission rate. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30‐day emergency department (ED) visit rate and 14‐day outpatient addiction clinic follow‐up rate. Results: Participants (n = 44) were mean 45.1 years‐old, 20.5% female, 56.8% white/Caucasian, 34.1% Hispanic, 61.4% stably housed. All interventions were feasible, with approximately 3.8 participants recruited per month, no serious adverse events reported, and 90.9% with complete inpatient protocol adherence. For the linkage‐alone (LA), naltrexone (NTX), and ketamine (KET) arms, the thirty‐day readmission rates were 41.2, 21.4, and 15.4% respectively. Thirty‐day emergency department rates were 70.6, 57.1, and 53.9% respectively. Fourteen‐day follow up rates were 41.2, 50.0, and 61.5% respectively. Comparing the KET arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission was 0.37 (P = 0.17). Comparing the NTX arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission 0.52 (P = 0.27) DISCUSSION: A single ketamine infusion or naltrexone injection given pre‐discharge, combined with enhanced treatment linkage, are feasible and may reduce readmission rates among medically hospitalized patients with AUD, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with Dakwar et al. [3] who demonstrated beneficial effects with a single ketamine infusion compared to their active control, midazolam, among a lower‐acuity AUD population. IM naltrexone ‐ representing an aspirational standard of care ‐ also demonstrated favorable outcomes compared to the LA arm. A lack of blinding may have introduced expectancy effects for the two pharmacologic interventions. Moreover, despite randomization, the linkage alone arm appeared to be more housing insecure, male, and predisposed to care utilization than the other arms. The ketamine arm had a lower baseline daily quantity of alcohol than the other arms. Next steps include further dissemination of results and planning a larger, blinded trial. If effective in recovery initiation, IV ketamine and/or IM naltrexone could represent a novel addition to the inpatient standard of care for AUD. Conclusions: In this randomized pilot trial among hospitalized AUD patients, both the ketamine infusion and naltrexone injection arms showed lower readmission rates and higher outpatient follow‐up rates compared to the linkage alone arm, though results were not statistically significant."

BACKGROUND: The Duration of Untreated Psychosis (DUP) is the time between the first-episode psychosis (FEP) and the initiation of antipsychotic treatment. It is an important predictor of several disease-related outcomes in psychotic disorders. The aim of this manuscript is investigating the influence of cannabis on the DUP and its clinical correlates. METHODS: During years 2014-2019, sixty-two FEP patients with and without cannabis use disorder (CUD) were recruited from several Italian psychiatric hospitals. The subjects were then divided into two groups based on the duration of the DUP and assessed at the beginning of the antipsychotic treatment and after 3 and 6 months, using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, and the Dissociative Experiences Scale (DES-II). RESULTS: As expected, a longer DUP was associated with worse symptoms and cannabis use did not seem to affect the DUP, but both were related with more dissociative symptoms at onset and over time. DISCUSSION: According to our study, cannabis use can be a predictor of FEP and DUP, and of disease outcome. However, several factors might influence the relationship between cannabis use and DUP. Preventing cannabis use and early diagnosis of psychotic disorders might impact the disease by reducing the persistence of symptoms and limiting dissociative experiences."

In order to improve the extraction efficiency, experimental parameters on the extraction, including extraction solvent and its volume, pH value of sample, extraction time and temperature were investigated. Under the optimal conditions, the average recoveries of MA, MDA and MDMA were 92.25, 85.94 and 91.50%, respectively. And the intra-day and inter-day relative standard deviations were not greater than 6.9%. The results indicate that the developed method is rapid, accurate and sensitive, and can be used for the simultaneous determination of MA, MDA and MDMA in urine for forensic application. © 2009 Vieweg+Teubner | GWV Fachverlage GmbH."
"7723","0","The Potential of Psychedelics for the Treatment of Episodic Migraine.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review presents the existing literature of and a framework for how psychedelic drugs might be applied as therapeutic agents in episodic migraine. RECENT FINDINGS: The therapeutic effects of psychedelics in headache disorders have been reported for decades and controlled investigations are now beginning. In the first and only clinical trial of a psychedelic drug in migraine, the single administration of low-dose psilocybin reduced weekly migraine days and pain intensity for the following 2 weeks in episodic subjects. These transitional effects, along with abortive effects in two subjects and additional findings in cluster headache, offer insight into the potential medicinal use of this and other psychedelic drugs in episodic migraine. The existing evidence supports the continued investigation of psilocybin and other psychedelics as transitional treatments in episodic migraine. Acute and preventive effects also exist, but the risks may outweigh benefits with these applications. Future research of psychedelics in episodic migraine should be tailored for this condition and not modeled after protocols used in other medical or psychiatric conditions."
"6986","1","A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics.^
The phenomenon of 'microdosing', that is, regular ingestion of very small quantities of psychedelic substances, has seen a rapid explosion of popularity in recent years. Individuals who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a systematic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naïve and experienced microdosers, so as to gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers. Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed."
"1169","0","NMDA receptor antagonist rodent models for cognition in schizophrenia and identification of novel drug treatments, an update.^
Negative and cognitive deficit symptoms in schizophrenia remain an unmet clinical need. Improved understanding of the neuro- and psychopathology of cognitive dysfunction in the illness is urgently required to enhance the development of new improved therapeutic strategies. Careful validation of animal models that mimic the behaviour and pathology of complex psychiatric disorders is an essential step towards this goal. Non-competitive NMDAR (N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor) antagonists e.g. phencyclidine (PCP), ketamine and dizocilpine (MK-801) can effectively replicate certain aspects of negative and cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia in animals. In 2010 we reviewed the effects of NMDAR antagonism in tests for domains of cognition affected in schizophrenia, social behaviour and neuropathology, and in 2014, in tests for negative symptoms. In this update, we evaluate the most recent pharmacological strategies for restoring cognition in schizophrenia using NMDAR antagonist models, published since our original review in 2010 (cited over 225 times, excluding self-citations). Tests reviewed are, novel object recognition for visual recognition memory, attentional set shifting for executive function, and operant tests incorporating recent touchscreen technology for a range of domains including working memory, problem solving and attention, all impaired in schizophrenia. Moreover, we include an update on parvalbumin (PV)-expressing GABAergic interneurons and review, for the first time, the effects of NMDAR antagonists on gamma oscillations, circuitry integral for effective cognition. Data summarized in this review strongly confirm the reliability and usefulness of NMDAR antagonist animal models for evaluating novel therapeutic candidates, and for improving our understanding of the pathophysiology of cognitive deficits in schizophrenia.

"1379","0","Frequency of substances use in young cohorts of university students.^
Understanding the etiology of alcoholism and drug addiction requires knowledge of the frequency of substance use in young cohorts, as well as the role of specific vulnerabilities that may explain the later development of these disorders. In the public health domain, efficient programs of prevention depend on the understanding of substance use in general population. The present study examined these issues in a large sample of university students, with particular attention to the risk factor of comorbid psychopathology. A two-phase sampling plan was used with post-stratification on substances use. In the first stage, an initial sample of 1 517 students was pre-selected based on responses to a battery of self-questionnaires, including information concerning recent consumption of substances (alcohol, cannabis, cocaine, heroin, acid, solvents...). 224 subjects were then selected in the second phase to compose four groups of substance users: infrequent consumers (those who did not use any substance during the last month; N = 80); frequent consumers of alcohol only (with a consumption of alcohol of several times a week to several times a day, regardless of tobacco use but with no other substance use; N = 44), frequent consumers of cannabis (consumption of cannabis of several times a week to several times a day, regardless of tobacco and alcohol use but with no other substance use; N = 54) and consumers of other illicit substances (consumption of hallucinogens, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, or other illicit substance at least once during the last month; N = 46). These representative subgroups of infrequent and frequent users were then administered a psychiatric diagnostic interview (Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview; MINI, version 5.0) to assess affective and mood disorders and substance use disorders. At the end of the study, all participants received 75 € ($100). The findings indicate maintenance of trends observed in France since 2000 for the stabilisation of alcohol use, a decrease in tobacco use, and an increase in cannabis among this age cohort. Nevertheless, it's important to note that these frequencies are based on frequent use of substances and, even if most of users do not fulfil criteria for abuse or dependence, such levels of consumption may have serious consequences for daily functioning and physical or mental health. In examining this issue, the percentage of comorbid psychopathology was found to be generally higher in substance using groups than in the control group, but these differences were significant only for consumers of illicit drugs. The findings are discussed in terms of consequences for the overall psychosocial functioning of young substance users and relative to the increased risk of developing a substance use disorder. © 2007 Elsevier Masson SAS.

"6388","0","Targeting inflammation in depression: Ketamine as an anti-inflammatory antidepressant in psychiatric emergency.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder with multifactorial aetiology and complex pathophysiology. Despite availability of various pharmacological and non-pharmacological therapeutic strategies, treatment resistant depression (TRD) remains a significant challenge with specific concern for those patients with severe depressive symptoms in particular suicidal ideations who require immediate and effective intervention. Inflammation has been widely studied for its association with MDD and treatment response. Ketamine known as a dissociative anaesthetic has a novel rapid-acting antidepressant effect at lower doses. Anti-inflammatory actions of ketamine appear to play a role in mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects. Considering the rapid antidepressant action of ketamine, this review provides a brief overview of antidepressant properties of ketamine as well as its effects on peripheral and central inflammation to better understand the mechanisms underlying the therapeutic action of ketamine as an anti-inflammatory antidepressant target in psychiatric emergency. Development of effective medications, which act rapidly with dual effect on both inflammation and MDD would be of a significant clinical importance for a successful and personalised treatment of inflammatory-induced TRD and suicidal thoughts and behaviour."

Articles in English were taken from 2019 to January 2023 focused on microdosing with psilocybin and mainly from the field of health sciences that studied its effects on mental health, well-being and on cognitive and psychomotor neurological processes, as well as the role of expectations in the clinical application of psilocybin or psychedelics in general. The objective was to understand where the scientific evidence points and what factors should continue to be considered for clinical research. Other articles were included because of their relevance to the topic. The studies that most reflect the positive effects are anecdotal reports, but there is difficulty in replicating these results in controlled studies. The systematic review does not specify the results in relation to psilocybin, but an overall improvement in mental health was found, In relation to anxiety and stress the results were mixed: positive outcomes were found in creativity and well-being. The difficulty is perceived in isolating the influence of expectations and placebo. Samples are too small to be significant in laboratory studies. Sociological studies can contribute to a better understanding of qualitative aspects. The current state of research on psilocybin microdosing can inform future research scenarios both in the preclinical and clinical phases with attention to confounding factors as well as qualitative and specific aspects of this practice.

"6967","0","An update on NMDA antagonists in depression.^
Introduction: Current antidepressant therapies exhibit low therapeutic efficiency and delayed onset of antidepressant action. Thus, the search for better acting agents is a continuous process. One of the primary targets for the development of new antidepressant drugs is the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. Areas covered: The present review aims to summarize and provide an update on published preclinical data evaluating the antidepressant efficacy of various NMDA antagonists and their mechanisms of action. The review also provides an update on the clinical efficacy of ketamine and esketamine as well as other NMDA receptor antagonists based on published results from clinical studies. Expert opinion: The recent approval of esketamine by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) culminates the almost 30 years of research focused on the NMDA receptor as a target for the development of antidepressants. This action gives hope to patients who do not respond to currently available pharmacotherapy. While knowledge of the mechanism of action of ketamine/esketamine will pave the way for the creation of a new class of antidepressants, recent results have shown that several issues regarding the use of these compounds or other NMDA receptor antagonists must be clarified."
"1277","1","The Effects of Acutely Administered 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Spontaneous Brain Function in Healthy Volunteers Measured with Arterial Spin Labeling and Blood Oxygen Level-Dependent Resting State Functional Connectivity.^
BACKGROUND: The compound 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a potent monoamine releaser that produces an acute euphoria in most individuals. METHODS: In a double-blind, placebo-controlled, balanced-order study, MDMA was orally administered to 25 physically and mentally healthy individuals. Arterial spin labeling and seed-based resting state functional connectivity (RSFC) were used to produce spatial maps displaying changes in cerebral blood flow (CBF) and RSFC after MDMA administration. Participants underwent two arterial spin labeling and two blood oxygen level-dependent scans in a 90-minute scan session; MDMA and placebo study days were separated by 1 week. RESULTS: Marked increases in positive mood were produced by MDMA. Decreased CBF only was observed after MDMA, and this was localized to the right medial temporal lobe (MTL), thalamus, inferior visual cortex, and the somatosensory cortex. Decreased CBF in the right amygdala and hippocampus correlated with ratings of the intensity of global subjective effects of MDMA. The RSFC results complemented the CBF results, with decreases in RSFC between midline cortical regions, the medial prefrontal cortex, and MTL regions, and increases between the amygdala and hippocampus. There were trend-level correlations between these effects and ratings of intense and positive subjective effects. CONCLUSIONS: The MTLs appear to be specifically implicated in the mechanism of action of MDMA, but further work is required to elucidate how the drug's characteristic subjective effects arise from its modulation of spontaneous brain activity."

In a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew's disease, Parkinson's disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice."

Indicated for treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation, esketamine (ESK) is self-administered under supervision at certified treatment centers. Our study was to determine if social determinants of health and distance were associated with ESK utilization. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 308 US adults initiating ESK between October 11, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and 1540 propensity-score matched controls with treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation. Adjusting for demographics, prior health care utilization and comorbidities, social determinant variables and distance were regressed separately on each outcome: ESK initiation, failure to complete induction (8 treatments in 45 days), and discontinuation within 6 months. ESK initiation was associated with higher population density (odds ratio [OR]: 2.12), American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander (OR: 3.19), and mental health (OR: 1.55) and primary care providers (OR: 1.55) per capita. Lower likelihood of ESK initiation was associated with living > 7.2 miles from a treatment center (OR: 0.75), living in rural areas (OR: 0.64), and percent non-Hispanic African American (OR: 0.58) and Hispanic (OR: 0.40). Health care providers should tailor patient engagement strategies to mitigate potential barriers to initiating and continuing appropriate treatment. Failing to complete induction was associated with substance use disorder and longer distance to treatment center was associated with discontinuation (hazard ratio: 1.48), as was percent Asian population (hazard ratio: 1.37). Prior psychiatric care and residence in counties with high rates of primary care providers per capita, unemployment, and high school graduation were associated with both higher likelihood of completing induction and lower likelihood of discontinuation."
"1433","1","Maintenance of antidepressant and antisuicidal effects by D-cycloserine among patients with treatment-resistant depression who responded to low-dose ketamine infusion: a double-blind randomized placebo-control study.^
Increasing evidence supports a rapid antidepressant and antisuicidal effect of a single subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Maintaining the initial clinical response after ketamine infusion in TRD is a crucial next-step challenge. D-cycloserine (DCS), a partial agonist of the glycine co-agonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor, is potentially effective as a depression augmentation treatment. However, whether DCS maintains the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine infusion remains unknown. In all, 32 patients with TRD (17 with major depression and 15 with bipolar depression) who responded to ketamine infusion with an average 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD) score of 9.47 ± 4.11 at baseline were randomly divided to 6-week DCS treatment (250 mg for 2 days, 500 mg for 2 days, 750 mg for 3 days, and 1000 mg for 5 weeks) and placebo groups. Depression symptoms were rated at timepoints of dose titration and weekly. During the 6-week treatment, the total scores of HAMD did not differ between the DCS and placebo groups. The results remained consistent when stratified by disorder. A mixed model analysis indicated that the DCS group exhibited lower scores of HAMD item 3 (suicide) compared with the placebo group throughout the follow-up period (p = 0.01). A superior maintenance of the antisuicidal effect of ketamine was observed in the DCS group than in the placebo group. DCS may be therapeutically beneficial for patients with TRD who responded to ketamine infusion but have a residual suicidal risk."

RATIONALE: Psychedelic research continues to garner significant public and scientific interest with a growing number of clinical studies examining a wide range of conditions and disorders. However, expectancy effects and effective condition masking have been raised as critical limitations to the interpretability of the research. OBJECTIVE: In this article, we review the many methodological challenges of conducting psychedelic clinical trials and provide recommendations for improving the rigor of future research. RESULTS: Although some challenges are shared with psychotherapy and pharmacology trials more broadly, psychedelic clinical trials have to contend with several unique sources of potential bias. The subjective effects of a high-dose psychedelic are often so pronounced that it is difficult to mask participants to their treatment condition; the significant hype from positive media coverage on the clinical potential of psychedelics influences participants' expectations for treatment benefit; and participant unmasking and treatment expectations can interact in such a way that makes psychedelic therapy highly susceptible to large placebo and nocebo effects. Specific recommendations to increase the success of masking procedures and reduce the influence of participant expectancies are discussed in the context of study development, participant recruitment and selection, incomplete disclosure of the study design, choice of active placebo condition, as well as the measurement of participant expectations and masking efficacy. CONCLUSION: Incorporating the recommended design elements is intended to reduce the risk of bias in psychedelic clinical trials and thereby increases the ability to discern treatment-specific effects of psychedelic therapy."

Comments on an article by A. L. McInnes et al. (see record [rid]2016-18596-021[/rid]). The read with great interest a recent correspondence by McInnes et al. (1) regarding a possible switch from depression to mania/ mixed state in a woman with bipolar disorder type I. The potential of subanesthetic doses of ketamine to alleviate depressive mood rapidly has gained considerable attention in the scientific community in recent years. As ketamine moves closer to more widespread application and clinical trials, its drawbacks and limitations are becoming increasingly obvious, including cognitive, psychological, and addiction-related adverse effects. One potential serious side effect is the ability of ketamine to induce transient psychotomimesis that has been hypothesized to facilitate mania/psychosis. This potential side effect is the reason why susceptible patients, such as patients with psychotic forms of depression, have so far been excluded, with the exception of the study by Da Frota Ribeiro et al., from clinical studies. This case suggests that possible interactions of ketamine and other substances, especially affecting drug metabolizing pathways, should be closely monitored in future studies. The evidence presented in this case report cannot conclusively rule out the possibility that the development of psychosis/ mania was primarily caused by cannabis intoxication (but likely facilitated by ketamine) as an alternative explanation, which would also be consistent with results from larger studies showing that ketamine is not associated with affective switches in patients with bipolar disorder (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"

Background: Shivering after surgery is one of the common problems following general anesthesia and may lead to multiple complications. This study was performed to find out a suitable alternative for pethidine in prevention of post-anesthetic shivering. Methods: In this randomized Triple-blind prospective study, 160 patients with the age of 20-50 years and ASA class I- II for elective laparascopic cholecystectomy were classified into five equal groups. Anesthesia was induced equivalently for all. Patients were observed in terms of vital signs, side effects and shivering. Results: The four groups were not different regarding age, gender, weight and the physical status class based on the American Society of Anesthesiologists score. Shivering after surgery was observed in 37.596 of patients in the pethidine group, 42.5% of patients in the ketannin group and 40% of patients in the ondansetron group that was significantly lower than the controls 57.5%. Changes in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate and temperature were similar in all four groups. Also the incidence of nausea and vomiting in the ondansetron group was significantly less than other groups (P value <0.05). Discussion: Due to the significant decrease in shivering in the treatment group compared to the control group, and the stability of hemodynamic changes in all groups, with regard to a significant reduction in nausea and vomiting using ondansetron, this drug can be a good alternative to reduce shivering after general anesthesia."
"1953","1","Bidirectional relations between MDMA and social context: crosstalk between drug response and social interaction.^
Many drugs of abuse are used in social settings, i.e., in the presence of others. Yet, little is known about the effects of drugs in social contexts, including how they affect social interactions, or conversely, how social conditions affect responses to drugs. Ecstasy, or methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in particular, is known for its prosocial effects, and it is typically used in groups. MDMA is thought to facilitate feelings of social connectedness. However, most controlled studies of the psychopharmacology of this and other abused drugs is that the effects of drugs are typically studied in a socially isolated setting, rather than in a social context. Thus, the full spectrum of drug effects may not be detected. To address this gap, we have conducted controlled, double blind laboratory studies to examine the effects of MDMA on measures of social function, including the ability to detect emotions in others, reactivity to positive and negative social images, and sensitivity to social rejection. We have also studied the effects of social context on responses to the drug, by testing participants in the presence of other subjects, including those who did or did not also receive the drug. Taken together, we have established that MDMA dampens reactivity to negative emotional expressions in others, that it reduces feelings of social rejection, and that its effects are enhanced in the presence of others. This line of research will help to understand the basis of recreational use of MDMA, as well as its potential therapeutic use."
"7524","1","Psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar mood disorders: a systematic review.^
Unipolar mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), confer high rates of disability and mortality and a very high socioeconomic burden. Current treatment is suboptimal in most cases and there is little of note in the pharmaceutical development pipeline. The psychedelic drugs, including lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, were used extensively in the treatment of mood disorders, and other psychiatric conditions, before their prohibition in the late 1960s. They are relatively safe when used in medically controlled environments, with no reported risk of dependence. Here, we present a systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics in patients with broadly defined UMD, and consider their place in psychiatry. Whilst all of the included studies have methodological shortcomings, of 423 individuals in 19 studies, 335 (79.2%) showed clinician-judged improvement after treatment with psychedelics. A recently completed pilot study in the UK favours the use of psilocybin with psychological support in treatment resistant depressive disorder. The evidence overall strongly suggests that psychedelics should be re-examined in modern clinical trials for their use in unipolar mood disorders and other non-psychotic mental health conditions."

However, to date, there have been several study limitations (e.g., small sample sizes, blinding, limited follow-up, highly screened treatment populations) and some health/political issues, including practitioners' experience, lack of standardized protocols, psychedelics' legal status, ethical concerns, and potential psychological/psychopathological/medical untoward effects. The focus here is on a range of clinical and methodological issues, also aiming at outlining some possible suggestions.

Adverse events such as dizziness and somnolence reported in clinical studies suggest that ESL has detectable central nervous system (CNS) effects in addition to its antiepileptic effects. This Phase I study evaluated the abuse liability of ESL compared with that of alprazolam (ALP) and placebo (PBO) in recreational CNS depressant users. METHODS: In this single-dose, randomized, double-blind, PBO- and active-controlled crossover study, healthy recreational CNS depressant users who could discern between ALP 2mg and PBO received single oral doses of each of the following treatments with a washout interval of ≥7days between each treatment: ESL (800mg, 1600mg, 2000mg, and 2400mg); ALP (1.5mg and 3.0mg); and PBO. Subjective measures, including visual analog scales (VASs) e.g., Drug-Liking (primary endpoint), and Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) Morphine-Benzedrine Group (MBG), Pentobarbital Chlorpromazine Alcohol Group (PCAG), and Lysergic Acid Diethylamide Group scales were evaluated at multiple time points up to 24h postdose. Cognitive effects were evaluated using the Choice Reaction Time (CRT), Divided Attention (DAT) and Hopkins Verbal Learning Task-Revised tests. PRINCIPAL RESULTS: Peak scores for Drug-Liking VAS (maximum effect [Emax]) were significantly higher for both ALP doses than for PBO (p<0.0001), thereby confirming study validity. Drug-Liking VAS Emax was significantly lower for all ESL doses than both ALP doses (p<0.0001). Drug-Liking VAS Emax for ESL 800mg was similar to that for PBO (least squares [LS] mean difference: 3.6; p=0.19). At the three higher ESL doses (1600mg and the supratherapeutic doses of 2000mg and 2400mg), Drug-Liking VAS Emax was significantly higher than for PBO, although the differences were minimal (LS mean difference: 9.3-13.3 out of 100). For most secondary subjective endpoints (i.e., Good Effects VAS and High VAS, ARCI-MBG, Take Drug Again VAS, Overall Drug-Liking VAS, and ARCI-PCAG; p<0.05), the effect of ESL (all doses) was significantly less than that of ALP (both doses). On most secondary measures, the dose-response relationship was relatively flat or showed saturation at higher ESL doses. Although significant differences were observed for ESL compared with those for PBO for some specific CRT and DAT endpoints (i.e., reaction time, manual tracking, hit latency), ALP demonstrated significant and dose-dependent impairment on the majority of cognitive endpoints when compared with PBO and ESL. Mean plasma concentrations of the active metabolite of ESL, eslicarbazepine, increased with increasing ESL dose. Pharmacokinetic parameters estimated for eslicarbazepine were generally comparable with results from previous studies in healthy volunteers. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that single doses of ESL may have less abuse liability than ALP in recreational sedative users. Although ESL had detectable subjective effects and showed some drug-'liking' at higher doses, the magnitude of these effects was small."
"6303","1","A Gratuitous Grace: The Influence of Religious Set and Intent on the Psychedelic Experience.^
Psychedelic drugs, or entheogens, have been used for religious purposes among various cultures for thousands of years. Recently, these substances have caught the attention of Westerners for many reasons, including their propensity to induce mystical experiences. This study examined the relationship between religion and having mystical experiences. A total of 119 participants were drawn from psychedelic-related websites and asked to complete an anonymous online questionnaire containing items regarding history of psychedelic use, set and setting for psychedelic use, and a measure for mystical experiences. A majority of respondents were White males who displayed at least some level of post-secondary education. The findings indicated that respondents who used psychedelics for specifically religious purposes, as well as those who identified with a religion, were more likely to score higher on the Mysticism Scale than those who did not."
"184","1","The subjective experience of acute, experimentally-induced Salvia divinorum inebriation.^
This study examined the overall psychological effects of inebriation facilitated by the naturally-occurring plant hallucinogen Salvia divinorum using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty healthy individuals self-administered Salvia divinorum via combustion and inhalation in a quiet, comfortable research setting. Experimental sessions, post-session interviews, and 8-week follow-up meetings were audio recorded and transcribed to provide the primary qualitative material analyzed here. Additionally, post-session responses to the Hallucinogen Rating Scale provided a quantitative groundwork for mixed-methods discussion. Qualitative data underwent thematic content analysis, being coded independently by three researchers before being collaboratively integrated to provide the final results. Three main themes and 10 subthemes of acute intoxication emerged, encompassing the qualities of the experience, perceptual alterations, and cognitive-affective shifts. The experience was described as having rapid onset and being intense and unique. Participants reported marked changes in auditory, visual, and interoceptive sensory input; losing normal awareness of themselves and their surroundings; and an assortment of delusional phenomena. Additionally, the abuse potential of Salvia divinorum was examined post hoc. These findings are discussed in light of previous research, and provide an initial framework for greater understanding of the subjective effects of Salvia divinorum, an emerging drug of abuse."

After participating in this activity, learners should be better able to:• Identify the effects of dysregulated opioid signalling in depression• Evaluate the use of opioid compounds and ketamine in patients with depression ABSTRACT: Major depressive disorder (MDD) remains one of the leading causes of disability and functional impairment worldwide. Current antidepressant therapeutics require weeks to months of treatment prior to the onset of clinical efficacy on depressed mood but remain ineffective in treating suicidal ideation and cognitive impairment. Moreover, 30%-40% of individuals fail to respond to currently available antidepressant medications. MDD is a heterogeneous disorder with an unknown etiology; novel strategies must be developed to treat MDD more effectively. Emerging evidence suggests that targeting one or more of the four opioid receptors-mu (MOR), kappa (KOR), delta (DOR), and the nociceptin/orphanin FQ receptor (NOP)-may yield effective therapeutics for stress-related psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, the effects of the rapidly acting antidepressant ketamine may involve opioid receptors. This review highlights dysregulated opioid signaling in depression, evaluates clinical trials with opioid compounds, and considers the role of opioid mechanisms in rapidly acting antidepressants."
"3211","0","Validation of an LC-MS/MS method for the quantitative analysis of 1P-LSD and its tentative metabolite LSD in fortified urine and serum samples including stability tests for 1P-LSD under different storage conditions.^
A variety of hallucinogens of the lysergamide type has emerged on the drug market in recent years and one such uncontrolled derivative of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is 1-propionyl-LSD (1P-LSD). Due to the high potency of LSD and some of its derivatives (common doses: 50–200 μg), sensitive methods are required for the analysis of biological samples such as serum and urine. The occurrence of an intoxication case required the development of a fully validated, highly sensitive method for the quantification of 1P-LSD and LSD in urine and serum using LC-MS/MS. Given that LSD is unstable in biological samples when exposed to light or elevated temperatures, we also conducted stability tests for 1P-LSD in urine and serum under different storage conditions. The validation results revealed that the analysis method was accurate and precise with good linearity over a wide calibration range (0.015-0.4 ng mL−1). The limit of detection (LOD) and the lower limit of quantification (LLOQ) of 1P-LSD and LSD in serum and urine were 0.005 ng mL−1 and 0.015 ng mL−1, respectively. The stability tests showed no major degradation of 1P-LSD in urine and serum stored at −20 °C, 5 °C or at room temperature for up to five days, regardless of protection from light. However, LSD was detected in all samples stored at room temperature showing a temperature-dependent hydrolysis of 1P-LSD to LSD to some extent (up to 21% in serum). Serum samples were particularly prone to hydrolysis possibly due to enzymatically catalyzed reactions. The addition of sodium fluoride prevented the enzymatic formation of LSD. The method was applied to samples obtained from the intoxication case involving 1P-LSD. The analysis uncovered 0.51 ng mL−1 LSD in urine and 3.4 ng mL−1 LSD in serum, whereas 1P-LSD remained undetected. So far pharmacokinetic data of 1P-LSD is missing, but with respect to the results of our stability tests and the investigated case rapid hydrolysis to LSD in-vivo seems more likely than instabilities of 1P-LSD in urine and serum samples."
"2748","0","Further observations on primary modes of perception: The Use of a Masking Technique for Subliminal Visual Stimulation.^
1. This study had as its purpose the validational testing of an observation of Urbantschitsch; namely, that a visual stimulus rendered invisible by covering it with sheets of paper still registered through the paper upon the perceptual apparatus. hlethodology was based upon the possible recovery of transformations of this stimulus through the images of a group of subjects. Experimental controls, an a priot-i system of quantification, statistical applications, and ‘blind’ scorers were part of the experimental design. The results supported this hypothesis of Urbantschitsch to a significant degree. 2. A subsidiary hypothesis, that the use of an ‘ego-impairing’ drug (LSD-25) in subhallucinatory doses would increase the degree of delivery of percepts into subsequent imagery, was also tested and confirmed. The research techniques for tliis corollary experiment were the same as for the main study and used part of its research sample. 3. Experimental images under LSD showed certain qualitative differences from those obtained in the main experiment. These differences were an increase in color, light, and inanimate movements, and a decrease in the importance of the shapes of the image objects. It was speculated that these findings indicate the presence of an archaic level of perception that might precede the developmental pliase dominated by primary-process transformations. In this archaic stage, visual perception would be Gestalt-free and dominated by color, light, and movement sensations. 4. Note was taken of certain similarities between the Urbantschitsch phenomenon and certain parapsychological findings. A review of the literature devoted to the psi-phenomenon led to the interpretation that some of the results claimed for parapsychology may be based, instead, upon subliminal registration. 5. Individual differences in degree of utilization of subliminal stimuli were noted. The need for studies of individual differences was stressed. The markedly enhanced delivery of the subliminal stimulus following ingestion of LSD was interpreted as indicating that regression of the ego's perceptual apparatus is related to such increased utilization. © 1960, SAGE Publications.

The discovery of ketamine as a rapid and robust antidepressant marks the beginning of a new era in the treatment of psychiatric disorders. Ketamine is thought to produce rapid and sustained antidepressant effects through restoration of lost synaptic connections. We investigated this hypothesis in humans for the first time using positron emission tomography (PET) and [11C]UCB-J—a radioligand that binds to the synaptic vesicle protein 2A (SV2A) and provides an index of axon terminal density. Overall, we did not find evidence of a measurable effect on SV2A density 24 h after a single administration of ketamine in non-human primates, healthy controls (HCs), or individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) and/or posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), despite a robust reduction in symptoms. A post-hoc, exploratory analysis suggests that patients with lower SV2A density at baseline may exhibit increased SV2A density 24 h after ketamine. This increase in SV2A was associated with a reduction in depression severity, as well as an increase in dissociative symptoms. These initial findings suggest that a restoration of synaptic connections in patients with lower SV2A at baseline may underlie ketamine’s therapeutic effects, however, this needs replication in a larger sample. Further work is needed to build on these initial findings and further establish the nuanced pre- and post-synaptic mechanisms underpinning ketamine’s therapeutic effects."
"6887","1","Prevalence and impact of recreational drug use in patients with acute cardiovascular events.^
OBJECTIVE: While recreational drug use is a risk factor for cardiovascular events, its exact prevalence and prognostic impact in patients admitted for these events are not established. We aimed to assess the prevalence of recreational drug use and its association with in-hospital major adverse events (MAEs) in patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units (ICCU). METHODS: In the Addiction in Intensive Cardiac Care Units (ADDICT-ICCU) study, systematic screening for recreational drugs was performed by prospective urinary testing all patients admitted to ICCU in 39 French centres from 7 to 22 April 2021. The primary outcome was prevalence of recreational drug detection. In-hospital MAEs were defined by death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or haemodynamic shock. RESULTS: Of 1499 consecutive patients (63±15 years, 70% male), 161 (11%) had a positive test for recreational drugs (cannabis 9.1%, opioids 2.1%, cocaine 1.7%, amphetamines 0.7%, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 0.6%). Only 57% of these patients declared recreational drug use. Patients who used recreational drugs exhibited a higher MAE rate than others (13% vs 3%, respectively, p<0.001). Recreational drugs were associated with a higher rate of in-hospital MAEs after adjustment for comorbidities (OR 8.84, 95% CI 4.68 to 16.7, p<0.001). After adjustment, cannabis, cocaine, and MDMA, assessed separately, were independently associated with in-hospital MAEs. Multiple drug detection was frequent (28% of positive patients) and associated with an even higher incidence of MAEs (OR 12.7, 95% CI 4.80 to 35.6, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of recreational drug use in patients hospitalised in ICCU was 11%. Recreational drug detection was independently associated with worse in-hospital outcomes.

"9122","0","Psilocybin in Palliative Care: An Update.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes clinically and socially relevant developments over the past five years in the therapeutic use of the classical tryptamine psychedelic substance psilocybin, with respect to the common challenges faced by palliative care patients and their care teams. Psilocybin is available in whole fungal and isolated forms but is not yet approved for therapeutic use in the United States. Using targeted database and gray literature searches, and author recall, key sources were identified, reviewed, and synthesized as to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in palliative care. RECENT FINDINGS: Life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses and faced by palliative care patients are comorbid with emotional and spiritual distress. Research and field reports reviewed suggest that psilocybin has significant and in some cases, sustained anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects with a favorable safety profile. Limitations of the research include the risk for selection bias toward healthy, white, financially privileged individuals, and in general, follow-up timelines too short to appropriately evaluate durability of outcomes in psychospiritual benefits and quality of life. SUMMARY: While more research is needed for palliative care populations specifically, reasonable inferences can be made regarding the potential for benefit to palliative care patients from psilocybin's demonstrated anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects. However, major legal, ethical and financial barriers to access exist for the general population; obstacles which are likely worsened for geriatric and palliative care patients. Empiric treatment and large-scale controlled trials of psilocybin should be conducted to further investigate the findings of the smaller studies reviewed here across a variety of populations, for a greater understanding of therapeutic benefit and clinically relevant safety criteria, and to support thoughtful legalization and medical access."
"1948","1","A prospective cohort study on sustained effects of low-dose ecstasy use on the brain in new ecstasy users.^
It is debated whether ecstasy use has neurotoxic effects on the human brain and what the effects are of a low dose of ecstasy use. We prospectively studied sustained effects (>2 weeks abstinence) of a low dose of ecstasy on the brain in ecstasy-naive volunteers using a combination of advanced MR techniques and self-report questionnaires on psychopathology as part of the NeXT (Netherlands XTC Toxicity) study. Outcomes of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and questionnaires on depression, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were compared in 30 subjects (12M, 21.8+/-3.1 years) in two sessions before and after first ecstasy use (1.8+/-1.3 tablets). Interval between baseline and follow-up was on average 8.1+/-6.5 months and time between last ecstasy use and follow-up was 7.7+/-4.4 weeks. Using 1H-MRS, no significant changes were observed in metabolite concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), and creatine (Cr), nor in ratios of NAA, Cho, and mI relative to Cr. However, ecstasy use was followed by a sustained 0.9% increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in frontoparietal white matter, a 3.4% decrease in apparent diffusion (ADC) in the thalamus and a sustained decrease in relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) in the thalamus (-6.2%), dorsolateral frontal cortex (-4.0%), and superior parietal cortex (-3.0%) (all significant at p<0.05, paired t-tests). After correction for multiple comparisons, only the rrCBV decrease in the dorsolateral frontal cortex remained significant. We also observed increased impulsivity (+3.7% on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and decreased depression (-28.0% on the Beck Depression Inventory) in novel ecstasy users, although effect sizes were limited and clinical relevance questionable. As no indications were found for structural neuronal damage with the currently used techniques, our data do not support the concern that incidental ecstasy use leads to extensive axonal damage. However, sustained decreases in rrCBV and ADC values may indicate that even low ecstasy doses can induce prolonged vasoconstriction in some brain areas, although it is not known whether this effect is permanent. Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings."
"7748","1","Mismatch negativity encoding of prediction errors predicts S-ketamine-induced cognitive impairments.^
Psychotomimetics like the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine and the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) agonist psilocybin induce psychotic symptoms in healthy volunteers that resemble those of schizophrenia. Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) may underlie the expression of psychotic symptoms. This study used a roving mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to investigate whether the encoding of PE is affected by pharmacological manipulation of NMDAR or 5-HT(2A)R, and whether the encoding of PE under placebo can be used to predict drug-induced symptoms. Using a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design, S-ketamine and psilocybin, respectively, were administrated to two groups of healthy subjects. Psychological alterations were assessed using a revised version of the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC-R) questionnaire. As an index of PE, we computed changes in MMN amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding standards (MMN memory trace effect) during a roving paradigm. S-ketamine, but not psilocybin, disrupted PE processing as expressed by a frontally disrupted MMN memory trace effect. Although both drugs produced positive-like symptoms, the extent of PE processing under placebo only correlated significantly with the severity of cognitive impairments induced by S-ketamine. Our results suggest that the NMDAR, but not the 5-HT(2A)R system, is implicated in PE processing during the MMN paradigm, and that aberrant PE signaling may contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments. The assessment of the MMN memory trace in schizophrenia may allow detecting early phases of the illness and might also serve to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments, in particular of cognitive impairments."
"5184","0","Psychedelics action and schizophrenia.^
Psychedelics are compounds acting by serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT)(2A) receptor activation and induce several behavioral responses. They are of special interest because of their positive effects on neuropsychiatric disorders (depression and posttraumatic stress disorder). However, several findings revealed that some psychedelic actions are similar to symptoms observed in schizophrenia (psychosis, sensorimotor gating impairments, attention, and working memory deficits) which might limit their clinical applications. Psychedelics activate some neurotransmitters, i.e., serotonergic, and glutamatergic, that are also impaired in schizophrenia. Therefore, the neurobiological background of psychedelics and schizophrenia is partially similar. Another important aspect to discuss is the perspective of using psychedelics in schizophrenia therapy. Postmortem studies showed a loss of synapses in schizophrenia, and the positive effects of psychedelics on neuroplasticity (synaptogenesis, neurogenesis, and neuritogenesis) might be essential in the context of schizophrenia therapy. However, because of psychedelics' psychotic action, the recommended doses of psychedelics in schizophrenia treatment are not established, and subpsychedelic dosing or microdosing are considered. Exploratory studies are needed to determine the tolerability of treatment and appropriate dosing regimen. Another therapeutic option is using non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogs that also induce neuroplastic outcomes but do not have psychotogenic effects. Further preclinical and clinical studies are needed to recognize the potential effectiveness of 5-HT(2A) agonists in schizophrenia therapy."

Ecstasy is one of the most popular amusing drugs among young people. Documents indicate some effects of Ecstasy on hippocampus and close relations between dopaminergic functions with reward learning. Therefore, the aim of this study was evaluation of the chronic effects of Ecstasy on memory in male Wistar rats and determination of dopamine receptors' gene expression in hippocampus. Forty adult male Wistar rats randomly distributed in five groups: Control, sham (received 1 ml/kg 0.9% saline) and three experimental groups were: Exp. 1 (2.5 mg/kg), Exp. 2 (5 mg/kg), and Exp. 3 (10 mg/kg) received MDMA intraperitoneally once every 7 days (3 times a day, 3 hours apart) for 4 weeks. Before the first injection animals trained in Shuttle Box memory and tested after the last injection. 24 hours after the final testing, brains of rats were dissected and hippocampus was removed and homogenized. After total RNA extraction and cDNA synthesis, expression of dopamine receptor genes in the hippocampus determined with Real-Time PCR. Our results showed that 2.5 and 5 mg/kg MDMA-treated groups had memory impairment. Also we found that MDMA increased the mRNA expression of dopamine receptors in hippocampus and the highest increase found in dopamine D1 receptors in the 5 mg/kg experimental group. We concluded that low doses of Ecstasy could increase Dopamine takers gene expression in hippocampus and disorder avoidance memory. But in high doses the increase in Dopamine takers gene expression was not as much as that in low doses and avoidance memory disorder was not observed."

Upon further review, we identified two suicidality-related events that were not described in the original manuscript. Both of these events were deemed not attributable to the administration of a psychedelic by the authors of the primary outcome trials. One completed suicide was reported by Griffiths et al. (2016) 11 days following the administration of a very low dose (placebo-like) of psilocybin (1 mg/70 kg psilocybin). Importantly, this individual was not administered an “active” dose of psilocybin during the course of the study.1 One suicide attempt was reported by Anderson et al. (2020) approximately 2 months after the administration of an active dose of psilocybin (21−25.2 mg/70 kg).2 For further details, see the supporting information of the respective manuscripts. Although these events are likely not attributable to psychedelic therapy itself, they point to the importance of closely attending to safety within psychedelic therapy and research."

Desire and satisfaction were moderately to profoundly increased by MDMA in more than 90% of subjects. Orgasm was delayed but perceived as more intense. Erection was impaired in 40% of the men. It seems that MDMA impairs sexual performance, in spite of enhancement of sexual desire and the perception of greater satisfaction. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS."

Overall, attitudes were neutral but self-rated knowledge of Psilocybin was low. The term used in the survey, ‘Psilocybin’ or ‘Magic Mushrooms’, did not significantly affect their responses. Some variables (i.e., gender, attitudes towards medical cannabis, and personal history of psychedelic usage) were associated with ratings of Psilocybin.

"8271","1","Impact of Cytochrome P450 2D6 Function on the Chiral Blood Plasma Pharmacokinetics of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and Its Phase I and II Metabolites in Humans.^
3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) metabolism is known to be stereoselective, with preference for S-stereoisomers. Its major metabolic step involves CYP2D6-catalyzed demethylenation to 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA), followed by methylation and conjugation. Alterations in CYP2D6 genotype and/or phenotype have been associated with higher toxicity. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 function on the plasma pharmacokinetics of MDMA and its phase I and II metabolites was tested by comparing extensive metabolizers (EMs), intermediate metabolizers (IMs), and EMs that were pretreated with bupropion as a metabolic inhibitor in a controlled MDMA administration study. Blood plasma samples were collected from 16 healthy participants (13 EMs and three IMs) up to 24 h after MDMA administration in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period, cross-over design, with subjects receiving 1 week placebo or bupropion pretreatment followed by a single placebo or MDMA (125 mg) dose. Bupropion pretreatment increased the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve from 0 to 24 h (AUC24) of R-MDMA (9% and 25%, respectively) and S-MDMA (16% and 38%, respectively). Bupropion reduced the Cmax and AUC24 of the CYP2D6-dependently formed metabolite stereoisomers of DHMA 3-sulfate, DHMA 4-sulfate, and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA sulfate and HMMA glucuronide) by approximately 40%. The changes that were observed in IMs were generally comparable to bupropion-pretreated EMs. Although changes in stereoselectivity based on CYP2D6 activity were observed, these likely have low clinical relevance. Bupropion and hydroxybupropion stereoisomer pharmacokinetics were unaltered by MDMA co-administration. The present data might aid further interpretations of toxicity based on CYP2D6-dependent MDMA metabolism."
"7192","1","Dose-related behavioral, subjective, endocrine, and psychophysiological effects of the κ opioid agonist Salvinorin A in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Salvia divinorum (Salvia) is an increasingly popular recreational drug amongst adolescents and young adults. Its primary active ingredient, Salvinorin A (SA)-a highly selective agonist at the κ opiate receptor-is believed to be one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. However, there is little experimental data on the effects of SA in humans. METHODS: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy individuals who had previously used Salvia. RESULTS: SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations, including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood. SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects. The perceptual altering effects and lack of euphoric effects would explain its intermittent use pattern. Such a profile would also suggest a low addictive potential similar to other hallucinogens and consistent with κ opiate receptor agonism. Further work is warranted to carefully characterize a full spectrum of its effects in humans, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved, and to explore the basis for individual variability in its effects."

Leveraging ~10 years of prospective longitudinal data on 704 participants, we examined the effects of adolescent versus young adult cannabis initiation on MRI-assessed cortical thickness development and behavior. Data were obtained from the IMAGEN study conducted across eight European sites. We identified IMAGEN participants who reported being cannabis-naïve at baseline and had data available at baseline, 5-year, and 9-year follow-up visits. Cannabis use was assessed with the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Drugs. T1-weighted MR images were processed through the CIVET pipeline. Cannabis initiation occurring during adolescence (14–19 years) and young adulthood (19–22 years) was associated with differing patterns of longitudinal cortical thickness change. Associations between adolescent cannabis initiation and cortical thickness change were observed primarily in dorso- and ventrolateral portions of the prefrontal cortex. In contrast, cannabis initiation occurring between 19 and 22 years of age was associated with thickness change in temporal and cortical midline areas. Follow-up analysis revealed that longitudinal brain change related to adolescent initiation persisted into young adulthood and partially mediated the association between adolescent cannabis use and past-month cocaine, ecstasy, and cannabis use at age 22. Extent of cannabis initiation during young adulthood (from 19 to 22 years) had an indirect effect on psychotic symptoms at age 22 through thickness change in temporal areas. Results suggest that developmental timing of cannabis exposure may have a marked effect on neuroanatomical correlates of cannabis use as well as associated behavioral sequelae. Critically, this work provides a foundation for neurodevelopmentally informed models of cannabis exposure in humans."

Thus, ANS activity was derived from electrocardiogram recordings after intake of placebo, LSD or ketanserin, and LSD by calculating R-peak-based measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Repeated measure ANOVA and partial correlation for HRV measures and subjective experience questionnaires were performed. LSD predominantly increased sympathetic activity, while ketanserin counteracted this effect on the ANS via an increase of parasympathetic tone. Sympathetic activity was positively and parasympathetic activity negatively associated with psychedelic effects of LSD. Furthermore, Placebo HRV measures predicted subjective experiences after LSD intake. The association between trait ANS activity and LSD-induced subjective experiences may serve as a candidate biomarker set for the effectiveness of LSD in the treatment of psychopathological conditions."
"3719","1","Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^
BACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data."
"8955","1","A longitudinal study of self-reported psychopathology in early ecstasy and amphetamine users.^
Aims: It still remains unclear whether psychopathological abnormalities described in human 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine users (MDMA users) and d-amphetamine users (AMPH users) existed before the beginning of regular use or if they develop with ongoing use. Objectives: The present study was conducted in order to assess this relationship and to overcome previous methodological shortcomings. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study in 96 beginning MDMA and d-amphetamine users between 2006 and 2011 with a follow-up duration of 24 months. In order to explore the impact of MDMA and AMPH use on self-reported psychopathology (measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), mixed models for repeated measures were fitted. In order to examine the impact of previous psychopathology on subsequent use, partial correlation analyses and linear regression analyses were applied. Results: Over the course of the 2-year follow-up period, 31 subjects used neither MDMA nor AMPH (non-users); 65 subjects used both MDMA and AMPH: 37 subjects used between 1 and 14 tablets of MDMA and 28 subjects used 15 or more tablets of MDMA. Thirty-three subjects used between 1 and 14 g of AMPH, and 32 subjects used 15 g or more. No associations concerning MDMA/AMPH use and development of self-reported psychopathology were found. However, there was a significant relationship between globally increased self-reported psychopathology - particularly psychoticism - at the beginning of the study and subsequent AMPH use. Conclusions: The data of the present study suggest that a certain psychopathological profile could form a risk factor for later use of amphetamines."
"668","1","Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy treatment of chronic pain and comorbid depression: a pilot study of two approaches.^
Chronic pain and depression diagnoses are skyrocketing. There is an urgent need for more effective treatments. Ketamine was recently established to alleviate pain and depression, but many gaps remain in the scientific literature. This paper reports the findings of an observational preliminary study that explored the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAPT) for chronic pain/major depressive disorder (MDD) comorbidity. Researchers evaluated two KAPT approaches to determine optimal route of administration/dose. Ten individuals diagnosed with a chronic pain disorder and MDD receiving KAPT were recruited: five individuals pursuing the psychedelic approach (high doses administered intramuscularly 24 h before therapy) and five individuals pursuing the psycholytic approach (low doses administered sublingually via oral lozenges during therapy). To evaluate differences between altered states of consciousness each approach induces, participants completed the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ30) after their first (T-1), third (T-2) and sixth/final (T-3) treatment sessions. Primary outcomes were change in Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) scores and Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) Short Form scores from baseline (T0) to (T-1)-(T-3). Secondary outcomes were changes in Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-7) Scale scores and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder Checklist (PCL-5) scores at each timepoint. Statistically significant differences between each approach were not observed, but the small sample's limited statistical power makes changes seen worth noting. All participants' symptoms declined throughout treatment. Psychedelic treatment participants saw a larger, more consistent decrease. Researchers conclude that KAPT may be effective for treating chronic pain/MDD comorbidity, anxiety and Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Findings imply that the psychedelic approach may be more effective. This pilot study serves as a basis for more extensive research that will inform how clinicians administer treatment to optimize outcomes."
"5832","1","Risks and benefits of psilocybin use in people with bipolar disorder: An international web-based survey on experiences of 'magic mushroom' consumption.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin, the primary psychoactive component of psychedelic 'magic mushrooms', may have potential for treating depressive symptoms, and consequent applications for bipolar disorder (BD). Knowledge of the risks and benefits of psilocybin in BD is limited to case studies. AIM: To support the design of clinical trials, we surveyed experiences of psilocybin use in people with BD. METHODS: An international web-based survey was used to explore experiences of psilocybin use in people with a self-reported diagnosis of BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses, with a focus on positive experiences of psilocybin use. RESULTS: A total of 541 people completed the survey (46.4% female, mean 34.1 years old). One-third (32.2%; n = 174) of respondents described new/increasing symptoms after psilocybin trips, prominently manic symptoms, difficulties sleeping and anxiety. No differences in rates of adverse events overall were observed between individuals with BD I compared to BD II. Use of emergency medical services was rare (n = 18; 3.3%), and respondents (even those who experienced adverse effects) indicated that psilocybin use was more helpful than harmful. Quantitative findings elaborated on perceived benefits, as well as the potential for psilocybin trips to contain both positively and negatively received elements. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective benefits of psilocybin use for mental health symptoms reported by survey participants encourage further investigation of psilocybin-based treatments for BD. Clinical trials should incorporate careful monitoring of symptoms, as data suggest that BD symptoms may emerge or intensify following psilocybin use."
"7354","1","Ketamine dysregulates the amplitude and connectivity of high-frequency oscillations in cortical–subcortical networks in humans: Evidence from resting-state magnetoencephalography-recordings.^
Hypofunctioning of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) has been prominently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (ScZ). The current study tested the effects of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic and NMDA-R antagonist, on resting-state activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers. In a single-blind cross-over design, each participant (n = 12) received, on 2 different sessions, a subanesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.006 mg/Kg) and saline injection. MEG-data were analyzed at sensor- and source-level in the beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (30–90 Hz) frequency ranges. In addition, connectivity analysis at source-level was performed using transfer entropy (TE). Ketamine increased gamma-power while beta-band activity was decreased. Specifically, elevated 30–90 Hz activity was pronounced in subcortical (thalamus and hippocampus) and cortical (frontal and temporal cortex) regions, whilst reductions in beta-band power were localized to the precuneus, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, temporal and visual cortex. TE analysis demonstrated increased information transfer in a thalamo-cortical network after ketamine administration. The findings are consistent with the pronounced dysregulation of high-frequency oscillations following the inhibition of NMDA-R in animal models of ScZ as well as with evidence from electroencephalogram-data in ScZ-patients and increased functional connectivity during early illness stages. Moreover, our data highlight the potential contribution of thalamo-cortical connectivity patterns towards ketamine-induced neuronal dysregulation, which may be relevant for the understanding of ScZ as a disorder of disinhibition of neural circuits.

"6037","1","Ketamine in the Treatment of Suicidal Depression.^
Patients currently taking psychiatric medications may continue them during the study. However, if a patient is taking a benzodiazepine (such as Ativan, Klonopin, or Xanax), they will be able to take up to 2mg per day of Lorazepam during the week before the infusion, but none will be permitted in the 24 hours pre‐infusion. Also, Zolpidem (Ambien) will not be permitted in the 24 hours pre‐infusion. If a person chooses to participate, their dose of benzodiazepine may need to be reduced so that they can do without it during the 24 hours pre‐infusion. Depressed participants are randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Ketamine(0.5 mg/kg) or Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg), which is given slowly, in a vein, over about 40 minutes. The study is ""double‐blind,"" meaning patients and study staff will not know which medication is in the infusion. If a patient does not respond to the first infusion, and s/he received Midazolam, then s/he will be offered the option of a second infusion, this time with Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). S/he will then start treatment with a standard antidepressant, unless s/he is not already taking one. After the infusion(s), participants will have weekly research interviews for 6 weeks to monitor response. If a patient does have a sufficient infusion response, and s/he is not already taking an antidepressant, then s/he will receive 6‐weeks antidepressant research treatment with Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, or Escitalopram, followed by open clinical treatment. However, if s/he is already taking an antidepressant, then s/he will receive open treatment. If s/he does not have a sufficient infusion response, then s/he will receive open treatment. Participation in this study requires a brief inpatient stay, at no cost, at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). Eligible participants enrolled in this study will be offered medication management visits at no cost for a total of up to 6 months from the date of enrollment combining inpatient and outpatient treatment. Study medications (Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Lorazepam, Zolpidem) will be at no cost during the 6 months. The study will not provide other medications at no cost."
"3148","1","Acute Experiences During Infusions Cause Extra-Pharmacological Antidepressant Effects in Ketamine Treatment: evidence From Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials.^
Background: Studies of rapid‐acting, psychoactive antidepressants like serotonergic‐psychedelics report that qualities like anxiety and positive‐affect during psychoactive experiences mediate clinical response. However, whether such non‐dissociative experiences are related to antidepressant responses following sub‐anesthetic infusions of the glutamate‐modulator ketamine has been minimally investigated using proper controls and sample‐sizes. Using 86 participants with treatment‐resistant unipolar or bipolar depression enrolled in double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover ketamine trials, we tested the hypothesis that self‐reported euphoria, fear or anxiety during ketamine’s psychoactive period mediates antidepressant response. We predicted that greater euphoria and lower anxiety and fear would predict reduced depressive symptom‐severity one (D1) and seven (D7) days following infusion. Methods: We administered a standard adverse events (AE) questionnaire (scored from zero‐three) that included “euphoria,” “fearful,” and “anxiety” items measured immediately after 40‐minute infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and saline. Our primary outcome was the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We used drug*AE‐interactions from mixed models to test mediation hypotheses. Covariates included diagnosis and baseline MADRS. Results: We did not detect any drug*AE interactions associated with D1 MADRS‐scores. While greater anxiety was associated with higher D1 MADRS for ketamine and placebo, (p= 0.007), main effects of fear (p=0.062) and euphoria (p=0.059) were weaker. We did not detect D7 interactions or main effects. Conclusions: Our results do not support a role for peri‐infusion, psychoactive experiences in ketamine’s antidepressant mechanism. Short‐lasting associations between experiences and response observed with ketamine and placebo is consistent with extra‐pharmacological effects. Further research is warranted since this analysis is post‐hoc and had limited measures of psychoactive experiences.

Fluoxetine has been shown to provide protection from MDMA induced long term neurotoxicity. The purpose of this investigation is to evaluate the pharmacokinetic drug interaction between MDMA and fluoxetine and also to determine the role of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) on mediating drug-drug interactions with MDMA. Bi-directional transport studies were conducted across MDCK-MDR1 and Caco-2 monolayers. MDMA brain and plasma levels were measured in P-gp deficient [mdr1a(-/-)] and normal [mdr1a(+/+)] mice after a 5 mg/kg i.p. dose of MDMA. Sprague-Dawley rats were pretreated with fluoxetine (4 days, 10 mg/kg, i.p.) or saline followed by MDMA (10 mg/kg, p.o.) and brain and plasma samples were collected over 10 h. MDMA and its active metabolite MDA were quantified using a HPLC method with fluorescence detection. In transport studies MDMA exhibited high permeability with essentially unpolarized transport. No significant difference in MDMA and MDA brain levels were seen in P-gp deficient versus normal mice. Pretreatment of rats with fluoxetine resulted in an increase in MDMA (1.4-fold) and MDA (1.5-fold) exposure in both brain and plasma. Elimination half-life was increased for MDMA (2.4 vs. 4.9 h) and MDA (1.8 vs. 8.2 h) with fluoxetine pretreatment. P-gp does not play a physiologically relevant role in absorption and distribution of MDMA, hence this transporter may not have a role in drug - drug interactions with MDMA. Fluoxetine pretreatment to provide protection from MDMA induced long term neurotoxicity decreases elimination of MDMA and MDA and may lead to enhanced risk of MDMA acute toxic effects. Overall, our results indicate that caution need to be practiced when recommending fluoxetine as an agent to provide protection from MDMA induced long term neurotoxicity. © 2007 Wiley-Liss, Inc. and the American Pharmacists Association."

Background: Depression and use of antidepressants are more common among patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) compared to the general population, but the relation of psychiatric comorbidity to use of different disease-modifying therapies (DMTs) is less clear. Objective: To determine whether risk of incident depression or antidepressant use differed across DMTs, and to assess whether depression and antidepressants affected risk of DMT discontinuation and MS relapses. Methods: We prospectively followed for 8 years a register-based nationwide cohort of 3803 relapsing-remitting MS patients. Results: Patients on rituximab had a lower risk of being diagnosed with depression or initiating antidepressants compared with the reference group treated with interferons (hazard ratio (HR) = 0.72, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.54–0.96). Patients diagnosed with depression discontinued interferon treatment to a higher extent than patients without depression (HR = 1.51; 95% CI = 1.15–1.98), as did patients on fingolimod initiating an antidepressant compared to patients who did not initiate an antidepressant (HR = 1.47; 95% CI = 1.04–2.08). Conclusions: Our results indicate that the choice of DMT is associated with subsequent risk of depression in MS, but further studies are needed to establish whether there is a causal link. Overall, depression and use of antidepressants displayed limited associations with DMT discontinuation and MS relapse."

An extended battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to three groups of college seniors (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]/mescaline users; marihuana/hashish users; and controls) who were matched on predrug usage intellectual and personality dimensions. The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references)."

"67","0","KETAMINE'S MECHANISM OF ACTION: A PATH TO RAPID-ACTING ANTIDEPRESSANTS.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating psychiatric disorder. Traditional antidepressants are of limited efficacy and take weeks to months to yield full therapeutic effects. Thus, there is a clear need for effective rapid-acting antidepressant medications. The N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) antagonist, ketamine, has received a great deal of attention over the last 20 years due to the discovery that a single subanesthetic dose leads to a rapid antidepressant effect in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. Animal and human research suggest that ketamine's antidepressant effects are mediated by a glutamate surge that leads to a cascade of events that result in synaptogenesis and reversal of the negative effects of chronic stress and depression, particularly within the prefrontal cortex (PFC). Preclinical and clinical data have provided compelling insights into the mechanisms underlying the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine. This review discusses stress-related neurobiology of depression and the safety, tolerability, and efficacy of ketamine for MDD, along with a review of ketamine's mechanism of action and prospective predictors of treatment response. Research limitations and future clinical prospects are also discussed."
"3478","0","Alcohol hangover has detrimental impact upon both executive function and prospective memory.^
The alcohol hangover (AH) is a state of general malaise following an evening of heavy episodic drinking when the blood alcohol concentration of the person reaches/approaches zero. The aim of the current study was to investigate what impact the AH has upon both executive function (EF) and prospective memory (PM). Previous research has shown that the AH has a detrimental effect upon cognitive abilities, including attention, working memory, and PM. The current study focused upon what impact AH might have upon both EF and related PM in the same cohort, both of which underpin everyday remembering. The current study compared an AH group (AHG) with a non-hangover group (NHG) on both EF and PM measures. Forty-one participants aged 18–29 years were tested; 19 comprised the AHG and 22 of whom made up the NHG (individuals who reported no heavy drinking the day before and did not report any significant hangover symptoms). A Verbal Fluency task measured EF and the Prospective Remembering Video Procedure measured PM. The Acute Hangover Rating Scale measured AH symptoms and severity, and a Digital Breath Analyzer Test measured their blood alcohol concentration (BAC). A Recreational Drug Use Questionnaire measured alcohol and other drug use. Anyone reporting having used an illicit substance across their lifetime (e.g., cannabis, ecstasy) or who smoked heavily were omitted from the study. Two univariate analyses of covariance compared the AHG and NHG groups on Verbal Fluency and Prospective Remembering Video Task scores (controlling for age, total alcohol units consumed per week, and the number of years spent drinking). The AHG recalled significantly fewer items on the Verbal Fluency task [F(1, 36) = 7.42, p < 0.01] and on the Prospective Remembering Video Task NHG [F(1, 36) = 14.9, p < 0.001] when compared with the NHG. Overall, it appeared that a state of AH significantly impaired both EF and PM. Given the importance of EF and PM to everyday remembering, these findings may have farther-reaching implications."

Amphetamine and related derivatives are widely abused central- and psychostimulants. Detection of certain derivatives, such as methcathinone, by commonly available immunoassay screening techniques is insufficient. Multi-analyte confirmations for amphetamine type stimulants are therefore required, but traditional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods necessitate lengthy analytical procedures with prolonged sample turn-around times. A validated rapid GC-MS assay for urinary confirmation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, ephedrine, norephedrine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine and N-methyl-1-(3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-butanamine is reported. The method entailed in situ derivatization of urine specimens by extractive acylation with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, followed by rapid chromatography on a microbore capillary column. Analytes were separated in less than 3 min and quantified simultaneously by selected-ion monitoring using stable isotope substituted internal standards. The total instrument cycle-time was 6 min per sample. The limits of detection were between 1.5 ng/mL and 6.25 ng/mL for the various analytes. Intermediate precision and accuracy were in the range of 6.3-13.8% and 90.5-107.3% for the respective analytes at the lower limit of quantitation, and between 5.8-12.6% and 95.4-103.1% for the high control. Long-term storage of methcathinone positive specimens at -20 °C proved insufficient stability of this analyte. The proposed assay is precise and accurate for confirmation of amphetamine and derivatives in urine. The complementary approach of extractive-derivatization and fast GC-MS analysis is especially applicable in routine clinical settings where reduced sample turn-around times are required. Further investigation of cathinone as a possible metabolite of methcathinone is warranted, based on results from analyzed authentic urine samples. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"7261","1","Prevention of psychedelic side effects associated with low dose continuous intravenous ketamine.^
Objective. Continuous low dose infusion of intravenous ketamine for postoperative analgesia was often associated with frightening acute psychodysleptic experiences in our patients. We hypothesized they were due to boluses of ketamine accumulated in the infusion line. We evaluated on two successive groups the impact of perfusion line modifications on psychodysleptic side effects occurrence. Methods. We compared a reference historic group (in which ketamine line was connected to perfusion line) to a second prospective group (in which ketamine line was connected to the venous catheter via an unidirectional valve). Results. Psychodysleptic experiences occurrence decreased from 4 patients of 26 (15%) to 2 of 116 (2%, p = 0.01). Moreover, these experiences were no longer associated with severe anxious symptoms like near death experiences. Conclusion. An unidirectional valve must be considered to limit the occurrence of low dose intravenous ketamine infusion associated psychedelic side effects, during postoperative analgesia. © 2008 Société Française de Pharmacologie et de Thérapeutique."
"8294","1","Evidence for a hallucinogen dependence syndrome developing soon after onset of hallucinogen use during adolescence.^
This study uses latent class methods and multiple regression to shed light on hypothesized hallucinogen dependence syndromes experienced by young people who have recently initiated hallucinogen use. It explores possible variation in risk. The study sample, identified within public-use data files of the 1999 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA), consists of 1186 recent-onset hallucinogen users, defined as having initiated hallucinogen use within 24 months of assessment (median elapsed time since onset of use ∼12 to 13 months). The recent-onset users in this sample were age 12 to 21 at the time of assessment and were between the ages of 10 and 21 at the time of their first hallucinogen use. The NHSDA included items to assess seven clinical features often associated with hallucinogen dependence, which were used in latent class modelling. Latent class analysis, in conjunction with prior theory, supports a three-class solution, with 2% of recent-onset users in a class that resembles a hallucinogen dependence syndrome, whereas 88% expressed few or no clinical features of dependence. The remaining 10% may reflect users who are at risk for dependence or in an early stage of dependence. Results from latent class regressions indicate that susceptibility to rapid transition from first hallucinogen use to onset of this hallucinogen dependence syndrome might be influenced by hallucinogenic compounds taken (for example, estimated relative risk, RR = 2.4, 95% CI = 1.6, 7.6 for users of MDMA versus users of LSD). Excess risk of rapid transition did not appear to depend upon age, sex, or race/ethnicity. Copyright © 2006 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

"455","0","Psychedelics, Psychotherapy and Symbolization: A Literature Review Focusing on Major Depressive Disorders.^
Aim: This article proposes a literature review focused on the so-called “classic” psychedelics (LSD, psilocybin, DMT, and mescaline) and, more specifically, on their use in the psychotherapy of major depressive disorders and the way they affect symbolization processes. Method: After some introductory remarks on psychedelics and depressive disorders, we describe some modern clinical trials, and then explore the peculiar phenomenology occurring in the psychedelic experience, as well as its therapeutic effects on depressive symptoms. The underlying mechanisms are discussed from a perspective at the crossroads of cognitive neurosciences and psychoanalysis. We conclude with some reflections on the crucial role of the setting. Results: The results already obtained suggest that a single dose, taken in a supportive environment, may be sufficient to produce significant and immediate therapeutic effects, which are still present six months after the dose, although less so for some patients. Clinical response depends on the subjective aspects of the individual experience. More specifically, it seems correlated with the ability to “let go” and to allow autobiographical memories to emerge, along with the intense emotions they carry. It also relies on the presence and intensity of mystical-type experiences, characterized by feelings of “ego dissolution,” unity with everything, transcendence of space and time, and ineffability. Discussion: Psychedelic-assisted therapy seems to promote the emergence of primary processes and the lifting of defense mechanisms. Psychedelics would thus catalyze the resumption of symbolization processes, favoring in particular the integration of unconscious conflicts as well as the remodeling of pathogenic object relationships. On the neurobiological level, these processes would be underpinned by a decrease in the activity of the default mode network – sometimes considered the primary biologic substrate of the Freudian ego –, associated with an increase in brain entropy and in neuroplasticity. These different elements entail a decrease in depressive symptomatology, particularly ruminations. Common factors identified as the cause of positive changes in classical psychotherapies appear naturally amplified in the psychedelic experience, which requires the containing function of a therapist and a supportive clinical setting to allow a resumption of symbolic processes. To ensure the perpetuation of the observed transformations, which often exceed the simple withdrawal of symptoms, an extended psychotherapeutic monitoring would be appropriate. Conclusion: The psychedelic substance acts as a catalyst, allowing an access to otherwise inaccessible unconscious materials, which can then be processed both spontaneously and within the therapeutic relationship. Considering the data discussed in this review, we emphasize the need for further research exploring the potential of this treatment, which also offers the hope of a renewed dialogue between psychiatry and psychology, neurosciences and psychoanalysis."

"7956","1","Side-effects associated with ketamine use in depression: a systematic review.^
This is the first systematic review of the safety of ketamine in the treatment of depression after single and repeated doses. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases and identified 288 articles, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. After acute dosing, psychiatric, psychotomimetic, cardiovascular, neurological, and other side-effects were more frequently reported after ketamine treatment than after placebo in patients with depresssion. Our findings suggest a selective reporting bias with limited assessment of long-term use and safety and after repeated dosing, despite these being reported in other patient groups exposed to ketamine (eg, those with chronic pain) and in recreational users. We recommend large-scale clinical trials that include multiple doses of ketamine and long-term follow up to assess the safety of long-term regular use."
"7415","1","Ketamine as augmentation for the treatment of major depression and suicidal risk in advanced cancer: Case report.^
OBJECTIVE: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is common in patients diagnosed with advanced cancer (AC), with a prevalence of 16.5%. It is associated with great disability and worsened quality of life, increased number and intensity of physical symptoms, and lower survival. It is the main factor for the presence of suicidal ideation. Antidepressants show modest efficacy, and response requires several weeks. Ketamine has demonstrated a fast and robust antidepressant effect in subanesthetic doses. This effect may prove useful in patients with AC, MDD, and suicidal risk. METHOD: We report a case of a patient with advanced cervical cancer who presented with uncontrollable pain, MDD, and a suicide attempt. RESULT: A 39-year-old woman diagnosed with cervical cancer stage IVB presented to the Emergency Department after a suicide attempt by hanging. Upon evaluation by the palliative care psychiatrist, she reported intense pain, unresponsive to analgesics, and had a history of persistent suicidal ideation. Antidepressant treatment was started (sertraline 50mg/d) after a single dose of ketamine hydrochloride IV (0.5 mg/kg) was administered. Treatment response was measured using the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale before and after the intervention. The depressive symptoms decreased by 17% on day 1, 39% on day 3, and 72% on day 17. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This case report shows ketamine's efficacy as an augmentation agent alongside conventional antidepressant treatment in patients with AC. Moreover, it shows rapid response in suicidal ideation that has not been achieved with treatment as usual. More clinical trials are needed to support the potential benefit and safety of ketamine in patients with AC, MDD, and persisting suicidal ideation."
"7219","1","An association between the regular use of 3,4 methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (Ecstasy) and excessive wear of the teeth.^
Aims. This study was established to determine if users of ecstasy had greater tooth wear than a comparison group of non-users. Design. The study involved a direct comparison between two groups of young people gathered by a peer information network and divided by the response to the question 'Do you take ecstasy?' Setting. The information network was established at the Maryland Centre in Liverpool (UK). Besides offering advice on drug and sex-related problems this centre distributes free condoms and is therefore visited by many young people who would not consider themselves to have these problems. Participants. There were 30 users and 28 non-users with no significant difference in the gender ratio. Age was not recorded to maintain absolute confidentiality, but all the participants appeared to be of student age. Measurements. Tooth wear was measured using the index of Smith and Knight. The social and drug-taking profile of the two groups was ascertained by questionnaire. Findings. It was found that the mean (± STD) tooth wear score for the back teeth was 0.96 ± 0.16 in the users compared with 0.12 ± 0.08 for the comparison group. These values were significantly different (p < 0. 001). The values for the front teeth were not significantly different. Many users were aware of clenching their teeth 12 or even 24 hours after taking the drug. Conclusion. Taking ecstasy results in an increased likelihood of tooth wear on the back teeth. This is likely to result from clenching the teeth in the acidic environment caused by carbonated (fizzy) drinks."
"4106","0","Sensitivity and Validity of Psychometric Tests for Assessing Driving Impairment: Effects of Sleep Deprivation.^
Objective To assess drug induced driving impairment, initial screening is needed. However, no consensus has been reached about which initial screening tools have to be used. The present study aims to determine the ability of a battery of psychometric tests to detect performance impairing effects of clinically relevant levels of drowsiness as induced by one night of sleep deprivation. Methods Twenty four healthy volunteers participated in a 2-period crossover study in which the highway driving test was conducted twice: once after normal sleep and once after one night of sleep deprivation. The psychometric tests were conducted on 4 occasions: once after normal sleep (at 11 am) and three times during a single night of sleep deprivation (at 1 am, 5 am, and 11 am). Results On-the-road driving performance was significantly impaired after sleep deprivation, as measured by an increase in Standard Deviation of Lateral Position (SDLP) of 3.1 cm compared to performance after a normal night of sleep. At 5 am, performance in most psychometric tests showed significant impairment. As expected, largest effect sizes were found on performance in the Psychomotor Vigilance Test (PVT). Large effects sizes were also found in the Divided Attention Test (DAT), the Attention Network Test (ANT), and the test for Useful Field of View (UFOV) at 5 and 11 am during sleep deprivation. Effects of sleep deprivation on SDLP correlated significantly with performance changes in the PVT and the DAT, but not with performance changes in the UFOV. Conclusion From the psychometric tests used in this study, the PVT and DAT seem most promising for initial evaluation of drug impairment based on sensitivity and correlations with driving impairment. Further studies are needed to assess the sensitivity and validity of these psychometric tests after benchmark sedative drug use."
"1901","0","d-Lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and other classic hallucinogens: Mechanism of action and potential therapeutic applications in mood disorders.^
Depression and anxiety are psychiatric diagnoses commonly associated with low quality of life and low percentage of responsiveness by patients treated with currently available drugs. Thus, research into alternative compounds to treat these disorders is essential to guarantee a patient's remission. The last decade has witnessed a revamped interest for the application of psychedelic medicine for the treatment of mental disorders due to anecdotal reports and clinical studies which show that low doses of d-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin may have antidepressant effects. LSD and psilocybin have demonstrated mood-modulating properties likely due to their capacity to modulate serotonergic (5-HT), dopaminergic (DA) and glutamatergic systems. LSD, belonging to the category of ""classic halluginogens,"" interacts with the 5-HT system through 5HT(1A), and 5HT(2A) receptors, with the DA system through D(2) receptors, and indirectly also the glutamatergic neurotransmission thought the recruitment of N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors. Randomized clinical studies have confirmed its antidepressant and anxiolytic effects in humans. Thus, in this chapter, we will review the pharmacology of psychedelic drugs, report the most striking clinical evidence which substantiate the therapeutic potentials of these fascinating compounds in mood disorders, and look into the horizon of where psychedelic medicine is heading."
"3009","0","Predictors of outcomes in drug abuse treatment - A prospective study about 257 patients of the Cassini center in Paris.^
Assessing the effectiveness of treatment is one of the main conceens of any medical process. The different ways proposed for assuming the responsibility of drug addicts and their efficacy are greatly heterogeneous since drug-abusing takes on diverse forms. Thus, in order to closely target the request of drug addicts and adjust their follow-up, we undertook to study prospectively, for 3 months, a population of drug addicts taking medical advice for the first time at the Cassini center in Paris, with the assumption that some predictors may forecast outcomes. Method : Data were obtained at the admission with a structured interview about socio-economic and demographic status, psychiatric disorders (assessed clinically according to DSM III-R and with HAD and MADRS scales), substance use and prior treatment history, environmental data (as well as familial substance use or support lending). Medical and paramedical referents have been interviewed after their first contact with the patient about his expectations and his motivation. Familial attendance at this first contact was noted as well as its implication in the programm. At the end of the study, we noted length of stay, regularity of follow up and clinical changes with a last interview of the staff. Results : Half the time, patients' follow up doesn't last a month, drug abuse doesn't change in 6 out of 10 cases, and we only note 14% of durable abstinence. Polydrug abuse (over 80%) is not linked, here, with pejorative outcomes, in opposition to the usual literature. Heroin is the main substance used by our population (over 80%), other opiates, sedatives and alcohol are associated by more than 30% of these patients ; cocain is associated in a quarter of the cases. More than 10% of the patients are concerned by ecstasy and LSD. Cannabis use is common. Medical complaint (mainly viral diseases) at the begining, of the programm, concerns one of two patients. Only a few are initialy known as being HIV positive, suggesting a great lack of information. Over forty percent of the patients are given a DSM III-R diagnosis at the end of the first medical advice, when a doubt subsists for a third of the other patients. Major depressive disorder for the first axis and borderline personality disorder for the second axis are the main disorders we founded. We also noted a large ratio (n = 13, 5%) of schizophrenic disorders. Univariate analysis: Length and regularity of the programms are key factors of their efficacy. A long follow-up is also required to improve patients' socio-economical status. Initial psychiatric disorders are linked, in our study as well as in literature, with longer stays in therapeutic programms. By revenge, psychiatric disorders at the third month (over 10%) are linked with poorer outcomes. We noted with interest that, in our sample, neither imprisonment in the past (over 40%, but we noted several imprisonments in a case out of two), or intraveinous route at any moment of the patient's life time (40%), or else a programm caused by a court (a quarter of the patients) are of wrong prognosis. Relatives' implication in the programm is linked with favorable outcomes. Multivariate analysis draws 3 independant clusters about the length of stay. One concerns patient's motivation as assessed by medical staff. An other one concerns patient's relatives' implication in the care. A third one is about the begining of the treatment: an initial medical prescrition and a psychological help are linked with favorable outcomes. About the efficacy, multivariate analysis isolates 4 independant clusters. Prior drug abuse programms (one out of three patients) are associated with poorer outcomes, when, by revenge, familial relationship initialy seen by the patient as (very) satisfaying, patient's motivation, and, again, an initial medical prescription are linked with better outcomes. The study of those of the patients whose programm lasted more then 3 months but without any appreciable benefit shows that a long follow-up is successfull when iris regular, when it provides a socio-economical status improvement and when the patient is given access to insight. For these patients, the (old) age is associated with better outcomes. By revenge, such a 3 months follow-up is not able to reduce drug abuse when a psychiatric disorder exists at the third month. Patients whose treatment was refered by a court don't differ from the others: their length of stay and outcomes are the same. Discussion: Our study confirms our initial hypothesis according to witch subgroups in our population of drug abusers should be isolated and that some predictors of outcomes should be described. Three points seem important to be discussed. First, a medical presciption appears to be important to initiate the relationship between the patient and his practicioner. We have never see any report about this particular point. Second, our study proves the importance of the patient's relatives' implication in the programm. Finaly, a programm ordered by a court is not pejorative per se. According to the literature, the other results we obtained corroborate some factors detected by other studies, and emphasize the priority of subjective contingents, especially psychopathological ones, over socio-demographical elements. The main limit of this study holds in the fact that our sample only concerns 78% of the population we could include in the study, according to the well known difficulties of such studies. It should be of interest to complete this study, especially to confirm these predictors on a longer term, in other centers and cities. Conclusion: According to the literature, this study accounts for the necessary global and sustained work with drug abusers. We have to answer to these patients' multiple requests, that don't just concern drug abuse, but also (and sometimes merely) psychiatric suffering, social isolation, or medical disease."
"4100","1","Perspectives on the therapeutic potential of MDMA: A nation-wide exploratory survey among substance users.^
Background: Alcohol and other substance use disorders are commonly associated with post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and the presence of these comorbidities is associated with worse treatment outcomes. Additionally, disparities in substance and PTSD prevalence have been associated with minority races and ethnicities, and minorities have been shown to be less likely to engage in treatment. Psychedelic-assisted treatments, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), have shown preliminary trans-diagnostic effectiveness, however it is unknown how individuals with substance use disorders view the therapeutic potential of MDMA therapy. Previous studies have also shown that minority races and ethnicities are under-represented in the MDMA trials, leading to concerns about inequitable access to clinical treatment. Methods: To explore demographic characteristics related to patient-level perspectives on the therapeutic potential of MDMA-assisted therapy, this study describes data from a nationwide, cross-sectional survey of 918 individuals self-reporting criteria consistent with alcohol or substance use disorders. Results: Overall, a majority of individuals reported support for medical research of MDMA (68.1%), belief that MDMA-assisted therapy might be a useful treatment (70.1%), and willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy if it were determined to be an appropriate treatment for them (58.8%). No race or ethnicity differences were found in support for further research or belief in effectiveness, however there were small disparities in terms of willingness to try MDMA-assisted therapy and concerns related to use of this treatment approach. Conclusion: These results provide insights and future directions as the field of psychedelic-assisted therapy seeks to provide equitable access to clinical care and to diversify research participation."
"6705","0","Human research on MDMA (3,4-methylene- dioxymethamphetamine) neurotoxicity: cognitive and behavioural indices of change.^
Laboratory animals can develop serotonergic neurotoxicity after repeated doses of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or 'Ecstasy'. If similar neural damage occurs in humans, this may be evident in cognitive or behavioural impairments. In a review of the behavioural skills shown by drug-free recreational Ecstasy users, three aspects of cognitive performance are often affected: reduced memory for new information (Rivermead Behavioral Memory, supraspan word recall), impaired higher executive processing (Wisconsin Card Sort, Tower of London), and heightened impulsivity (Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness and Empathy Questionnaire, Matching Familiar Figures test). Performance on other more basic cognitive functions is generally unimpaired (simple reaction time, choice reaction time, number vigilance, Stroop, trail making). Some Ecstasy users also complain of poor memories and/or concentration difficulties, which they attribute to MDMA use. There are many methodological problems and uncertainties with research in this field: non-random allocation of subjects to drug conditions, the deleterious effects of other psychoactive drugs, and the possibility that these adverse profiles reflect pre-existing personality characteristics in Ecstasy users. However, this particular pattern of cognitive decrements in humans, is consistent with the animal data on those brain areas showing serotonergic damage following MDMA: the frontal cortex (impulsivity and higher cognitive impairments), and hippocampus (memory deficits). Finally, this profile of cognitive deficits is also consistent with a hypothetical integrative construct: namely reduced cortical inhibition."
"7701","1","Overview of amphetamine-type stimulant mortality data - UK, 1997-2007.^
Background/Aims: Despite being amphetamine derivatives, MDMA and its analogues show a number of clinical pharmacological differences with respect to both amphetamine (AMP) and methylamphetamine (METH). We aimed here at reporting and analysing information relating to the socio-demographics and clinical circumstances of the AMP-type stimulant-related deaths for the whole of the UK. Methods: Data (1997-2007) were taken from the National Programme on Substance Abuse Deaths (np-SAD) database, collecting information from UK coroners/procurators fiscal. To calculate rates of fatalities per 100,000 users, appropriate AMP/METH and ecstasy users' numbers were taken from the 2001-2007 British Crime Survey. Results: Overall, 832 AMP/METH- and 605 ecstasy (mostly MDMA and methylenedioxyamphetamine/MDA)-related deaths were respectively identified. In comparison with AMP/METH victims, the ecstasy ones were more likely to be younger (28.3 vs. 32.7 years; p < 0.0001) and less likely to be known as drug users (PR = 1.9; CI 1.5-2.6). Ecstasy was more likely to be identified on its own than AMP/METH (p = 0.0192). Contributory factors were more frequently mentioned by coroners in the 'AMP/METH-only' (106 cases) group than in the 'ecstasy-only' (104 cases) one (p = 0.0043). Both poly- and monodrug AMP/METH fatalities per 100,000 16- to 59-year-old users were significantly more represented than ecstasy fatalities (respectively 17.87 ± 4.77 deaths vs. 10.89 ± 1.27; p = 0.000; 2.09 ± 0.88 vs. 1.75 ± 0.56; p = 0.0096). However, mono-intoxication ecstasy fatalities per 100,000 16- to 24-year-old users were significantly more represented than AMP/METH fatalities (1.67 ± 0.52 vs. 0.8 ± 0.65; p = 0.0007). Conclusion: With respect to AMP/METH, ecstasy was here more typically identified in victims who were young, healthy, and less likely to be known as drug users. AMP/METH high mortality rates may be explained by users' high levels of physical co-morbidity; excess ecstasy-related fatality rates in young users may be a reason for concern. Although the coroners' response rate was of 90-95%, study limitations include both reporting inconsistency over time and lack of routine information on drug intake levels prior to death.

"1442","1","Antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine on the functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex-related circuits in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, longitudinal resting fMRI study.^
BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that infusion of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine exerts antidepressant and antisuicidal effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). AIMS: In this investigation, we used the resting functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to determine the effects of ketamine on the functional connectivity (FC) of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related circuits in patients with TRD. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with TRD were recruited and randomly divided into three groups on the basis of ketamine infusion dose: 0.5 mg/kg (standard dose), 0.2 mg/kg (low dose), or normal saline (a placebo infusion). Resting functional MRI data and clinical data were recorded at the baseline and on the third day after ketamine infusion treatment. RESULTS: The standard-dose group showed a reduction in the FC of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right dorsolateral (dl)PFC with the other frontal regions. The low-dose group demonstrated a more pervasive reduction of FC in the bilateral dACC with other frontal and parietal regions. A negative correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the reduction in the FC between the left dACC and right ACC regions in the standard-dose group, whereas a positive correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the increase in the FC between the right dlPFC and left superior parietal region in the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that PFC-related circuit modulation is crucial to the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of the ketamine infusion treatment."

High drug related mortality has been registered in Norway. Although comparison between countries relies on a standard international coding system of diseases, different practices in verifying cause of death and applying codes could lead to variation. The comparison gives no information on drug findings or drug patterns underlying the cause of deaths. To evaluate deaths involving illicit drugs in Norway, we examined drug patterns in 2735 forensically examined post-mortem samples collected from 15-64 year-old individuals from 2000 to 2009. There were four times as many men as women among the deceased illicit drug users, and the majority were in the age group 25-44 years. The number of deceased showing signs of illicit drug use has gradually declined during the study period. The decline was found among younger individuals, while a larger proportion of the deceased were above 45 years of age in 2009, compared to 2000. Cases positive for heroin, ethanol, ecstasy and flunitrazepam were fewer in 2009, while the prevalence of amphetamine, cannabis, methadone and other opioids has increased. The prevalence of methamphetamine has increased ten fold, and the prevalence of benzodiazepines doubled. Thus, the drug pattern and age of the deceased has changed markedly during the last 10 years. Heroin and ethanol use has partly been substituted by use of amphetamines, cannabis, benzodiazepines and other opioids. This change could possibly be explained by the prolonged survival of drug users on substitution treatment and by the reduced toxicity of consumed drugs."
"6570","0","Comparison of the effects of alcohol and cannabis on visual function and driving performance. Does the visual impairment affect driving?.^
BACKGROUND: Alcohol and cannabis are the most widely consumed psychoactive substances worldwide. This study compared the effects of alcohol and cannabis on visual function and driving performance, as well as self-perceived effects. Also, the relationship between visual effects under the influence and driving performance was studied. METHODS: Sixty-four young drivers, with a history of alcohol and/or cannabis use were included. Of these, 33 were allocated to the alcohol group and 31 to the cannabis group. All participants were evaluated in a baseline session. The alcohol group underwent two sessions: after drinking 300 ml and 450 ml of red wine (A1 and A2). The cannabis group attended one session after smoking cannabis (C). Visual function was evaluated at the contrast sensitivity, stereoacuity, and intraocular straylight level. Participants drove a driving simulator. A general score (overall visual score, OVS; overall driving performance score, ODPS) was obtained for both visual functioning and driving performance. RESULTS: The evaluation of visual function demonstrated a significant impairment in OVS for all conditions studied (A1, p = 0.005; A2, p < 0.001; C, p < 0.001) with respect to the baseline session. General driving performance (ODPS) demonstrated a significant worsening for the A2 condition (p = 0.003). Finally, a significant relationship between driving performance and visual function was found (rho=0.163, p = 0.039 and χ(2) = 4.801, p = 0.028). CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis and alcohol use negatively impact visual function. However, driving performance was only significantly affected by the higher alcohol dose. This impairment in visual function was significantly associated with worse driving performance."

Methamphetamine use disorder is a chronic relapsing condition associated with substantial mental, physical, and social harms and increasing rates of mortality. Contingency management and psychotherapy interventions are the mainstays of treatment but are modestly effective with high relapse rates, while pharmacological treatments have shown little to no efficacy. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy is emerging as a promising treatment for a range of difficult-to-treat conditions, including substance use disorders; however, no studies have yet been published looking at psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy in the treatment of methamphetamine use disorder. Here we review the rationale for psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy as a potential treatment for this indication, and describe practical considerations based on our early experience designing and implementing four separate clinical trials of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy for methamphetamine use disorder."

Objective: To investigate associations between reported eating disorder (ED) diagnosis and substance use disorder (SUD) diagnosis, substance misuse, and illicit drug use among US college students. Method: Data consisting of n = 414,299 students' responses to the National College Health Assessment survey conducted by the American College Health Association between fall 2015 and spring 2019 were utilized for this study. Unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios were used to determine the association of reported ED diagnosis with reported SUD diagnosis, misuse of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine/methamphetamine, sedatives, hallucinogens, opiates, inhalants, MDMA, and other club drugs, as well as illicit use of prescription pain killers, prescription sedatives, and prescription stimulants. A sensitivity analysis investigating associations between reported anorexia nervosa (AN), bulimia nervosa (BN), and each substance use outcome was also conducted. Results: Among all in our analytic cohort, 7.15% reported receiving an ED diagnosis or being treated for an ED in the last 12 months. Students with ED indications were significantly more likely to report each of the substance use outcomes investigated in this study, including SUD diagnosis (aOR: 7.43; 95% CI: 6.98, 7.92; p <.0001), opiate misuse (aOR: 8.35; 95% CI: 7.38, 9.45; p <.0001), and misuse of other club drugs (aOR: 10.37; 95% CI: 9.10, 11.81; p <.0001) than peers without reported EDs. Both AN and BN were associated with an increased likelihood of SUD diagnosis. Discussion: These findings demonstrate strong associations between EDs and the most extensive list of substance use outcomes explored in the context of college setting ED research to date."

Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were measured for 24 h. Analgesic effects were evaluated in a cold pressor test and psychomotor effects were followed for 12 h. Results: Clarithromycin increased the mean Cmax of ketamine by 3.6-fold (p < 0.001) and the mean AUC0–1 of ketamine by 2.6-fold (p = 0.001). The relative amount of the CYP3A dependent metabolite norketamine was decreased by 54% by clarithromycin (p = 0.004). Self-rated drug effect of S-ketamine was enhanced by clarithromycin (p < 0.05) but other behavioral effects or cold pain scores were not affected. Conclusions: Clarithromycin strongly increases plasma concentrations of oral S-ketamine probably by inhibiting its CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation. This increase is reflected as modest changes in behavioral effects of oral S-ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"4970","1","Acute psychological and physiological effects of MDMA (""Ecstasy"") after haloperidol pretreatment in healthy humans.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") releases serotonin and dopamine. The role for dopamine in mediating the effects of MDMA has not yet been examined in humans. We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the dopamine D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg i.v.) on psychological and physiological responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design. Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales. The physiological effects measured were blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Side effects were assessed during the session, and after 1 and 3 days. Haloperidol attenuated MDMA-induced positive and mania-like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects. Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA. In contrast, dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA, indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine."

"8146","0","The death-implicit association test and suicide attempts: a systematic review and meta-analysis of discriminative and prospective utility.^
Suicide risk assessment involves integrating patient disclosure of suicidal ideation and non-specific risk factors such as family history, past suicidal behaviour, and psychiatric symptoms. A death version of the implicit association test (D-IAT) has been developed to provide an objective measure of the degree to which the self is affiliated with life or death. However, this has inconsistently been associated with past and future suicidal behaviour. Here, we systematically review and quantitatively synthesize the literature examining the D-IAT and suicide attempts. We searched psychINFO, Medline, EMBASE, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) from inception until 9 February 2021 to identify publications reporting D-IAT scores and suicide attempts (PROSPERO; CRD42020194394). Using random-effects models, we calculated standardized mean differences (SMD) and odds ratios (ORs) for retrospective suicide attempts. We then calculated ORs for future suicide attempts. ORs were dichotomized using a cutoff of zero representing equipoise between self-association with life and death. Eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria (n = 9551). The pooled SMD revealed higher D-IAT scores in individuals with a history of suicide attempt (SMD = 0.25, 95% CI 0.15 to 0.35); however, subgroup analyses demonstrated heterogeneity with acute care settings having lower effect sizes than community settings. Dichotomized D-IAT scores discriminated those with a history of suicide attempt from those without (OR 1.38 95% CI 1.01 to 1.89) and predicted suicide attempt over a six-month follow-up period (OR 2.99 95% CI 1.45 to 6.18; six studies, n = 781). The D-IAT may have a supplementary role in suicide risk assessment; however, determination of acute suicide risk and related clinical decisions should not be based solely on D-IAT performance."

"3722","1","Neural Correlates of the Shamanic State of Consciousness.^
Psychedelics have been recognized as model interventions for studying altered states of consciousness. However, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness, which is anecdotally similar to the psychedelic state, exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by an assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals in a previous study under the influence of psychedelics. Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered states of consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Furthermore, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenal traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state."
"3398","1","A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, but the time profile of ketamine's anxiolytic effect is ill-defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the anxiolytic effect of ketamine at different time points across a range of clinical settings. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to capture randomised control trials measuring the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in contexts including mood disorders, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. The correlations between (1) improvements in mean anxiety and depression scores, and (2) peak dissociation and improvements in mean anxiety scores were also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 11 studies. Ketamine significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to placebo at acute (<12 h; standard mean difference (SMD): -1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.89, -0.44], p < 0.01), subacute (24 h; SMD: -0.44, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.22], p < 0.01) and sustained (7-14 days; SMD: -0.40, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.17], p < 0.01) time points. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms correlated at both subacute (R(2) = 0.621, p = 0.035) and sustained time points (R(2) = 0.773, p = 0.021). The relationship between peak dissociation and improvement in anxiety was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine appears to offer rapid and sustained anxiety symptom relief across a range of clinical settings, with anxiolytic effects occurring within the first 12 h of administration and remaining effective for 1-2 weeks. Future studies could explore the effects of ketamine maintenance therapy on anxiety symptoms."
"5383","0","The Bright Side of Psychedelics: Latest Advances and Challenges in Neuropharmacology.^
The need to identify effective therapies for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is a particularly important issue in modern societies. In addition, difficulties in finding new drugs have led pharmacologists to review and re-evaluate some past molecules, including psychedelics. For several years there has been growing interest among psychotherapists in psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide for the treatment of obsessive-compulsive disorder, of depression, or of post-traumatic stress disorder, although results are not always clear and definitive. In fact, the mechanisms of action of psychedelics are not yet fully understood and some molecular aspects have yet to be well defined. Thus, this review aims to summarize the ethnobotanical uses of the best-known psychedelic plants and the pharmacological mechanisms of the main active ingredients they contain. Furthermore, an up-to-date overview of structural and computational studies performed to evaluate the affinity and binding modes to biologically relevant receptors of ibogaine, mescaline, N,N-dimethyltryptamine, psilocin, and lysergic acid diethylamide is presented. Finally, the most recent clinical studies evaluating the efficacy of psychedelic molecules in some psychiatric disorders are discussed and compared with drugs already used in therapy."

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), also known as ecstasy, is a popular drug often taken in environments rich in audio and visual stimulation, such as clubs and dance parties. The present experiments were conducted to test the notion that auditory stimulation influences the rewarding effects of MDMA. In Experiment 1, a conditioned place preference (CPP) procedure was conducted in which rats received MDMA (1.5 mg/kg, s.c.) in a distinctive environment accompanied by music (65-75 dB), white noise (70 dB), or no added sound. Animals were pretreated with saline on alternating days in an alternate environment. Results revealed CPP in animals exposed to white noise during MDMA trials. For Experiment 2, rats from Experiment 1 had access to operant levers that delivered intravenous MDMA (0.5 mg/kg/inj) or saline (0.1 ml) on alternate days in the presence or absence of the same types of auditory stimuli as previously experienced. After three each of MDMA and non-reinforced (saline) sessions, animals were tested for NAcc DA and 5-HT responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) or saline under the same stimulus conditions. Findings revealed that NAcc DA and 5-HT increased after an MDMA injection, and both DA and 5-HT were significantly highest in animals exposed to music during the test session. These results indicate that paired sensorial stimuli can engage the same systems activated during drug use and enhance neurochemical and behavioral responses to MDMA administration.

Psychotomimetic emergence phenomena following general anesthesia with ketamine are well documented, and affect 5-30% of patients. The psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been less well studied. We administered ketamine or saline in single blinded, crossover fashion to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using a computer-assisted continuous ketamine infusion that achieved a stepwise series of 5 constant plasma levels of ketamine, at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 jug/ml. After approximately 20 min at each level, to allow for equilibration with the biophase, the volunteer completed a visual analog rating of 13 psychotic and dissociative symptom scales involving color, reality, sounds, body parts, ideas of reference, surroundings, time, euphoria, out-of-control thoughts, anxiety, drowsiness and suspiciousness. Target ketamine levels were verified by measuring actual plasma concentration. Ketamine produced marked psychotomimetic effects that were doserelated in a highly linear fashion for all scales (r 0.92; p 0.03). Effects on anxiety, suspiciousness, and ideas of reference were weakest, attaining less than 22% of the maximum possible effect. For all other scales, 37-89% of the maximum possible effect was attained."

Purpose: The aim of the present study was to determine the acute effects of the 'Ecstasy' analogue MDE (3, 4-methylendioxyethamphetamine) on the cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers. Method: In a randomised double-blind trial, 16 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with 18-FDG PET 110120 minutes after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n=8) or placebo (n=8). Beginning two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, a constant cognitive stimulation was maintained for 32 minutes using a word repetition paradigm in order to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral 18-FDG uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using T1-weighted 3D flash MRI, followed by manual regionalisation into 108 regions-of-interest and PET/MRI overlay. Absolute quantification of rMRGlu and comparison of glucose metabolism under MDE versus placebo were performed using Mann-Whitney U- test. Results: Absolute global MRGlu was not significantly changed under MDE versus placebo (MDE: 41.8 ± 11.1 μmol/min/100 g, placebo: 50.1 ± 18.1 μmol/min/100 g, p=0.298). The normalised regional metabolic data showed a significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, p<0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, p<0.05). On the other hand, rMRGlu was significantly increased in the bilateral cerebellum (right: +10.1%, p<0.05; left: +7.6%, p<0.05) and in the right putamen (+6.2%, p<0.05). Conclusions: The present study revealed acute neurometabolic changes under the 'Ecstasy' analogon MDE indicating a fronto- striato-cerebellar dysbalance with parallels to other psychotropic substances and various endogenous psychoses respectively."
"4725","0","Novel harmala-ocudelic tuning (HOT) for ocular disorders.^
The eye contains serotonin, and possesses serotonergic receptors and modulators. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may impair ocular function, while other serotonin receptor-binding drugs might improve it. A putative vision-improving drug must be safe at therapeutic doses, most preferably with long-lasting benefits from a single or very few administration(s). One drug potentially satisfying these criteria is the common, botanically-occurring indole alkaloid and ""major hallucinogen,"" harmine. Harmine is prominent in the leaves of the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Passiflora, and in Peganum and Banisteriopsis, the two preeminent ""sacred"" medicinal plants of India/pre-Islamic Persia/modern Iran and the Amazon respectively. Though the possibility of drug-drug or herb-drug interactions exists, especially with SSRIs, at correct patient-individualized dosages, these plants, used alone, are minimally hallucinogenic, well tolerated, potentially exerting profound therapeutic effects on vision from a single or few administration(s) lasting months or years. The hypothesized mechanism for this extraordinary action is tuning of the serotonergic receptors in the eye in their binding affinity for serotonin, a putative neurochemical ""ocudelic"" homologue to the psychedelic phenomenon, likely potentiated, according to clinical experience with classical hallucinogens, by therapeutic music, positive psychological ""set,"" and conducive environmental ""setting."" Blinded research with harmala alkaloid-containing plants in ocular patients using psychedelic therapy accoutrements, viz. eyeshades, high fidelity classical music, headphones, two guides, pre-dosing preparation, and post-dosing integration, could non-invasively assess visual acuity in presbyopia. Significant results would stimulate further exploration of this novel approach to ocular disorders. Deeper benefit, particularly when the retina is compromised, might follow co-ingestion of the harmala alkaloid-containing plants with plants containing dimethyltryptamine."

We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and odds of hopelessness, suicidality, and co-occurring substance use among adolescent hallucinogen users. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 2001–2019 data that nationally represents school-going US adolescents. We identified hallucinogen use based on the survey questions, exploring the use of hallucinogens (LSD, PCP, mescaline, and mushrooms). (3) Results: Out of a total of 125,550 respondents, 8.4% reported using hallucinogens. Overall, the trend of hallucinogen use decreased from 13.3% (2001) to 7.0% (2019) (pTrend < 0.0001). Hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad and hopeless (aOR: 1.40; 95%CI: 1.21–1.61; p < 0.0001), considering suicide (aOR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.08–1.70; p = 0.009), and planning suicide (aOR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.19–1.86; p = 0.001). Additionally, adolescent hallucinogen users had a higher prevalence of alcohol, cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, synthetic marijuana, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy use.

Serotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769)."
"2431","1","Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder Measured Up to 10 Days After Ketamine Administration.^
BACKGROUND: The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). METHODS: Data were drawn from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants (33 with MDD and 25 HCs) who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. The DMN was defined using seed-based correlation and was compared across groups and scans. RESULTS: In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. This change was reversed after 10 days and did not appear in either of the placebo scans. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD."

Its main side effect is a syndrome of central nervous system stimulation occurring in 40-50% of adults in the first few weeks of therapy which might be observed at increased frequency in subjects concurrently using recreational substances. We therefore conducted a single center, retrospective study in 134 patients treated with efavirenz and found no significant differences in CNS side effects or discontinuation rates between recreational substance (cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis) users and non-users.

ANOVAs for these ratings were all significant at the p < .000 level, although BPRS increases were not in the range seen in decompensated schizophrenic patients. The amplitudes of the startle responses to pulse-alone stimuli were not significantly different on ketamine and placebo days. Ketamine did not cause disruption in PPI as expected.

Although a promising antidepressant and potential Past studies have shown that a single dose of ketamine, an NMDA‐ receptor antagonist has fast anti‐suicidal agent, ketamine has very significant side effects including: dissociation, hallucinations, delusional thinking, cognitive impairment, and significant sympathetic nervous system activation. Nitrous Oxide (N2O) is an NMDA‐receptor antagonist with a well‐known safety profile used as an analgesic. In a proof‐of‐concept pilot study, this study's investigator recently demonstrated that N2O also has rapid and marked antidepressant effects in patients with severe treatment‐resistant depression (TRD); further sub‐analyses showed N2O significantly reduced suicidal ideation (SI). While N2O administration may lead to a reduction in SI, it remains unknown whether severely suicidal patients requiring hospitalization on inpatient psychiatric units would benefit. Investigators hypothesize that N2O will rapidly and safely dampen suicidal thinking with minimal side effects in this population. Participants will be randomized to receive either N2O or placebo. The study intervention is in tandem with prescribed treatment‐as‐usual (TAU) by emergency department physicians relating to diagnosis (depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation); which typically involves anxiolytic medications and/or brief psychotherapy administered by care team psychiatry providers.

Current medications have not been effective in reducing the prevalence of mental illness worldwide. The prevalence of illnesses such as treatment-resistant depression has increased despite the widespread use of a broad set of psychopharmaceuticals. Transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine therapy are making great strides in improving treatment-resistant depression outcomes but they have limitations. New psychotherapeutics are required that specifically target the underlying cellular pathologies leading to neuronal atrophy. This neuronal atrophy model is supplanting the long-held neurotransmitter deficit hypothesis to explain mental illness. Interest in psychedelics as therapeutic molecules to treat mental illness is experiencing a 21st-century reawakening that is on the cusp of a transformation. Psilocybin is a pro-drug, found in various naturally occurring mushrooms, that is dephosphorylated to produce psilocin, a classic tryptamine psychedelic functional as a 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A receptor agonist. We have focused this review to include studies in the last two years that suggest psilocybin promotes neuronal plasticity, which may lead to changes in brain network connectivity. Recent advancements in clinical trials using pure psilocybin in therapy suggest that it may effectively relieve the symptoms of depression in patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Sophisticated cellular and molecular experiments at the systems level have produced evidence that demonstrates psilocybin promotes neuritogenesis in the mouse brain - a mechanism that may address the root cause of depression at the cellular level. Finally, studies with psilocybin therapy for major depressive disorder suggest that this ancient molecule can promote functionally connected intrinsic networks in the human brain, resulting in durable improvements in the severity of depressive symptoms. Although further research is necessary, the prospect of using psilocybin for the treatment of mental illness is an enticing possibility."

Introduction: This study offers insights into Dutch young people's expected social and personal consequences of ecstasy use. Substance use expectancies are assumed to be an essential component in explaining substance use behaviour and, therefore, the development of effective substance use prevention and treatment strategies. Method: Dutch young adults with an online interest in drug-related social media posts were targeted with an online survey about their use of alcohol and drugs. This resulted in a convenience sample (N = 4182, 73.4% female, M<sub>age</sub> = 21.11), of which 35.5% had used ecstasy at least once in their life and 29.3% had used ecstasy last year. Latent class analyses were used to identify subgroups based on both positive and negative expectancies of ecstasy use. Cross-class differences were examined using multinomial logistic regression. Results: This study yielded four distinct classes: only negative expectancies (13.6%), high positive and negative expectancies (23.5%), low to moderate positive and negative expectancies (20.6%), and mostly positive expectancies (22.4%). These classes differed significantly in lifetime experience with ecstasy use, intention to use ecstasy, perception of harmfulness and availability, and social norms regarding the use of ecstasy. Conclusion: Findings show that ecstasy use expectancies can be used to create meaningful classes of users and non-users, and that these classes are different enough to warrant varied prevention approaches. Expectancies young people have regarding the use of ecstasy are associated with various ecstasy use-related variables and should be taken into consideration when developing and implementing preventive interventions."
"5251","1","Prevalence of psilocybin use in vaping and associated factors: a study among amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) use disorder in Malaysia.^
Background: The emergence of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), including synthetic psilocybin, has raised concern among health experts due to the numerous health and socioeconomic consequences. The current trend is shifting to the hazardous use of synthetic psilocybin in vaping, and little is known about the prevalence of use, specifically among amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) users. Methods: Interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted in drug detention centers between March and October 2022. The study was conducted using ASSIST 3.0 and obtained information on the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics and clinical profiles. N = 355 ATS users were enrolled in this study. Results: The results show a high prevalence of psilocybin vaping among ATS users (182/355, 53.1%). Most of the respondents were males (85.1%) and unmarried (69.3%), with a mean age of 29.2 (SD = 7.3). Across all respondents, five factors were associated with psilocybin vaping: tobacco smoking, aOR =5.790 (95% CI: 1.723, 8.183); cannabis uses, aOR= 9.152 (95% CI: 2.693, 10.396); and alcohol use, aOR= 3.137 (95% CI: 1.461, 5.817). Respondents of the Malay race had higher odds of being involved in psilocybin vaping compared to other races, with aOR= 1.638 (0.043, 2.459). Meanwhile, a reduction in age by 1.9 will increase the likelihood of involvement in psilocybin vaping with aOR = 1.897 (95% CI: 0.857, 1.938). Conclusion: Psilocybin in vaping is growing among ATS users and across all populations. Unfortunately, knowledge regarding the long-term effects on health is limited. Further studies should highlight the harmful effects of psilocybin and the potential risk of psilocybin vaping among the younger population."
"8970","1","Altered Insula Connectivity under MDMA.^
Recent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to investigate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on large-scale patterns of brain activity. MDMA, a potent monoamine-releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin- releasing properties, has unique subjective effects that include: marked positive mood, pleasant/unusual bodily sensations and pro-social, empathic feelings. However, the neurobiological basis for these effects is not properly understood, and the present analysis sought to address this knowledge gap. To do this, we administered MDMA-HCl (100 mg p.o.) and, separately, placebo (ascorbic acid) in a randomized, double-blind, repeated-measures design with twenty-five healthy volunteers undergoing fMRI scanning. We then employed a measure of global resting-state functional brain connectivity and follow-up seed-to-voxel analysis to the fMRI data we acquired. Results revealed decreased right insula/salience network functional connectivity under MDMA. Furthermore, these decreases in right insula/salience network connectivity correlated with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily sensations under MDMA. The present findings highlight insular disintegration (ie, compromised salience network membership) as a neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience, and relate this brain effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations-both of which are known to be associated with insular functioning."
"7353","0","The Resurgence of Hallucinogen Drugs in Clinical Research.^
Since the dawn of civilization, ancient cultures have utilized hallucinogens from plants and fungi in the context of religious and healing practices. Recently, their use has expanded to other cultures. Hallucinogens are natural or synthetic substances that alter the perception of reality at nontoxic doses, producing intense psychological and physiological effects. The initial research on hallucinogens began in the 1950s. However, their non-medical use, studies without proper controls, and negative social opinion resulted in legal restrictions that limited their use for clinical and preclinical research for more than two decades. A renewed interest in studying hallucinogens as potential therapeutic agents for treating different psychiatric conditions has recently re-emerged. This review summarizes the effects of main hallucinogen drugs and their therapeutic potential. Classic hallucinogens such as LSD, dimethyltryptamine, psilocin, and mescaline have chemical structures similar to serotonin and directly activate 5-hydroxy-tryptamine (5-HT2A) receptors. Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic with antagonist effects at the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, indirectly activating 5-HT2A receptors. Ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects and reduces suicidal ideation, but its effects are short-lasting. Other hallucinogens are under study. It is necessary to continue this research with a more rigorous methodology and include studying the long-term effects of psychedelics use."

OBJECTIVE: Early evidence suggests that ketamine may be an effective treatment to sustain abstinence from alcohol. The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of ketamine compared with placebo in increasing abstinence in patients with alcohol use disorder. An additional aim was to pilot ketamine combined with mindfulness-based relapse prevention therapy compared with ketamine and alcohol education as a therapy control. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, 96 patients with severe alcohol use disorder were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) three weekly ketamine infusions (0.8 mg/kg i.v. over 40 minutes) plus psychological therapy, 2) three saline infusions plus psychological therapy, 3) three ketamine infusions plus alcohol education, or 4) three saline infusions plus alcohol education. The primary outcomes were self-reported percentage of days abstinent and confirmed alcohol relapse at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants (35 women; mean age, 44.07 years [SD=10.59]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were associated with the study drug. Although confidence intervals were wide, consistent with a proof-of-concept study, there were a significantly greater number of days abstinent from alcohol in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (mean difference=10.1%, 95% CI=1.1, 19.0), with the greatest reduction in the ketamine plus therapy group compared with the saline plus education group (15.9%, 95% CI=3.8, 28.1). There was no significant difference in relapse rate between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that treatment with three infusions of ketamine was well tolerated in patients with alcohol use disorder and was associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol at 6-month follow-up. The findings suggest a possible beneficial effect of adding psychological therapy alongside ketamine treatment."
"3320","0","Serotonin and serotonin receptors in hallucinogen action.^
Hallucinogens are a class of substances that induce profound changes in perception and cognition. A closely related drug, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), produces euphoria and a feeling of empathy, with minimal sensory distortion. Both of these classes of substances produce their effects by interacting with the serotonergic system. This chapter will review the receptor interactions that contribute to the behavioral effects of serotonergic hallucinogens and MDMA. In rodents, the behavioral effects of hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and mescaline are primarily mediated by activation of 5-HT2A receptors. There is evidence, however, that 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT2C receptors and dopamine receptors may play a secondary role. The molecular requirements for interaction of hallucinogens with the 5-HT2A receptor are well-defined on the basis of structure-activity relationships. By contrast with the hallucinogens, MDMA is a potent releaser of monoamines that has complex effects on serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. In recent years, psilocybin and MDMA have been administered to human volunteers in controlled clinical trials. Human studies confirm that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a primary role in mediating the subjective effects of psilocybin, whereas the effects of MDMA are largely attributable to carrier-mediated release of serotonin. These findings emphasize the importance of clinical investigation of hallucinogenic drugs. Additionally, there is a growing consensus that these drugs are likely to show therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders.

We studied the effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with oral ketamine for premedication in children. One hundred and sixty children aged between 2 and 6 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 1); 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 2); 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 3); and 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 4). Sedation levels 10, 20 and 30 min after premedication were evaluated using a 5-point sedation scale. A 4-point emotional state score was used to evaluate patients when they were separated from their parents and their response to intravenous cannulation or facemask application. Approximately 90% of patients readily accepted premedication and onset times of acceptable sedation were similar in all four groups. Patients in Group 4 were significantly more sedated than those in Group 1 after 30 min (p = 0.036). A significantly higher proportion of patients in Group 3 (84%) and Group 4 (87%) accepted intravenous cannulation compared with those in Group 1 (40%) and Group 2 (54%) (p = 0.001). We conclude that the administration of 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine and 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine was the optimal combination, with children being easily separated from their parent, accepting intravenous cannulation and without causing excessive side-effects or postoperative complications."

BACKGROUND: Cannabis and its main psychoactive component, Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), can elicit transient psychotic symptoms. A key candidate biological mechanism of how THC induces psychotic symptoms is the modulation of glutamate in the brain. We sought to investigate the effects of acute THC administration on striatal glutamate levels and its relationship to the induction of psychotic symptoms. METHODS: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy to measure glutamate levels in the striatum in 20 healthy participants after THC (15 mg, oral) and matched placebo administration in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design. Psychotic symptoms were measured using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory. RESULTS: We found that THC administration did not significantly change glutamate (glutamate plus glutamine relative to creatine) concentration in the striatum (p = .58; scaled Jeffreys-Zellner-Siow Bayes factor = 4.29). THC increased psychotic symptoms, but the severity of these symptoms was not correlated with striatal glutamate levels. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that oral administration of 15 mg of THC does not result in altered striatal glutamate levels. Further work is needed to clarify the effects of THC on striatal glutamate."

Since the late 1980s numerous reports have detailed adverse reactions to the use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) associated with cardiovascular collapse and sudden death, following ventricular tachycardia and hypertension. For a better understanding of the effects of MDMA on the cardiovascular system, it is critical to determine their effects at the vasculature level, including the transporter or neurotransmitter systems that are most affected at the whole range of drug doses. With this purpose in mind, the aim of our study was to evaluate the contractile effect of MDMA in the human internal mammary artery, the contribution of SERT for this effect and the responsiveness of this artery to 5-HT in the presence of MDMA. We have also studied the possible involvement of 5-HT2 receptors on the MDMA contractile effect in this human blood vessel using ketanserin. Our results showed that MDMA contracted the studied human's internal mammary artery in a SERT-independent form, through activation of 5-HT2A receptors. Considering the high plasma concentrations achieved in heavy users or in situations of acute exposure to drugs, this effect is probably involved in the cardiovascular risk profile of this psychostimulant, especially in subjects with pre-existing cardiovascular disease."

BACKGROUND: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

Adolescence is a critical period for the onset of illicit drug use. This study aimed to estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use among Chinese adolescents, to assess the associations between different forms of childhood maltreatment and subsequent illicit drug use and to test whether the child's sex plays a moderating role in the associations. A secondary analysis was made of cross-sectional data collected from 10th to 12th graders from China who were sampled in the 2015 School-based Chinese Adolescents Health Survey. A total of 59,518 questionnaires were included in the final analysis. The prevalence estimates and logistic regression analyses were weighted to account for the complex survey design. If the interaction term (between childhood maltreatment and sex) was significantly associated with illicit drug use, we would perform stratification analyses across sex. Of the total sample, 45.2% were boys, and the mean (SD) age was 17.0 (0.9) years. The results of stratification analyses demonstrated that among boys, physical abuse and sexual abuse were independently associated with an increased risk of use during their lifetime of MDMA, methamphetamine, ketamine, and mephedrone; among girls, only emotional abuse and sexual abuse were associated with MDMA use, methamphetamine use, ketamine use, and mephedrone use."

Background: MDMA is classified as an “empathogenic” drug, as it increases feelings of empathy and closeness to others. These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi‐structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within‐subject, double‐blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18‐35 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in‐lab sessions separated by 72 hours. During peak drug effect, they engaged in a 45 min semi‐structured conversation with a novel same‐sex partner. Subjective mood, physiological, and oxytocin levels were obtained at regular intervals, and subjects rated feelings of closeness and connection with their partners at the end of each session and one week later. Results: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased ratings of feeling connected to the partner, and increased ratings of enjoyment and meaningfulness of the conversation, relative to placebo (Study 1 MDMA; p=0.009 and Study 2 methamphetamine p=0.01). Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased subjective ratings of “sociable,” “loving,” and “friendly.” Only MDMA increased ratings of “trusting,” “grateful,” and “appreciated,” and only methamphetamine increased ratings of “understood” MDMA (p=0.001), and to a lesser extent methamphetamine (p=0.02) increased salivary oxytocin levels. Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs. This study provides a model for future studies assessing effects of drugs on interpersonal interactions."
"4049","1","Discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans trained to discriminate among d-amphetamine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and placebo.^
In animals, two-choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In order to delineate the relative role of these systems, three-choice paradigms have been used in animals, with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin. Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action. To parallel animal studies, the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist, d-amphetamine, a prototypic serotonergic agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA. In addition, subjective and physiological effects were measured. The results demonstrated that humans could be trained to discriminate among 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and placebo. When tested with 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, half the participants reported MDMA to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP. There were no clear differences between these two groups in other dimensions, although there was an indication that the individuals who discriminated MDMA as d-amphetamine were more sensitive to the effects of all the drugs. The subjective effects of all three drugs overlapped, although the effects of MDMA appeared more amphetamine-like."
"8313","0","Effects of lisdexamfetamine on plasma steroid concentrations compared with d-amphetamine in healthy subjects: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^
The novel d-amphetamine prodrug lisdexamfetamine is applied to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). d-Amphetamine releases dopamine and norepinephrine and stimulates the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, which may contribute to its reinforcing effects and risk of abuse. However, no data is currently available on the effects of lisdexamfetamine on circulating steroids. This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study evaluated the effects of equimolar doses of d-amphetamine (40 mg) and lisdexamfetamine (100 mg) and placebo on circulating steroids in 24 healthy subjects. Plasma steroid and d-amphetamine levels were determined up to 24 h. Delayed increase and peak levels of plasma d-amphetamine concentrations were observed following lisdexamfetamine treatment compared with d-amphetamine administration, however the maximal concentrations and total exposure (area under the curve [AUC]) were similar. Lisdexamfetamine and d-amphetamine significantly enhanced plasma levels of adrenocorticotropic hormone, glucocorticoids (cortisol, cortisone, corticosterone, 11-dehydrocorticosterone, and 11-deoxycortisol), androgens (dehydroepiandrosterone, dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate, and Δ4-androstene-3,17-dione [androstenedione]), and progesterone (only in men) compared with placebo. Steroid concentration-time curves were shifted to later time points due to a non-significantly later onset following lisdexamfetamine administration than after d-amphetamine, however maximal plasma steroid concentrations and AUCs did not differ between the active treatments. None of the active treatments altered plasma levels of the mineralocorticoids aldosterone and 11-deoxycorticosterone or the androgen testosterone compared with placebo. The effects of the amphetamines on glucocorticoid production were similar to those that were previously reported for methylphenidate (60 mg) but weaker than those for the serotonin releaser 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 125 mg) or direct serotonin receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD; 0.2 mg). Lisdexamfetamine produced comparable HPA axis activation and had similar pharmacokinetics than d-amphetamine, except for a delayed time of onset. Thus, serotonin (MDMA, LSD) may more effectively stimulate the HPA axis than dopamine and norepinephrine (D-amphetamine)."
"8847","1","A pilot study of plasma metabolomic patterns from patients treated with ketamine for bipolar depression: evidence for a response-related difference in mitochondrial networks.^
BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: (R,S)-ketamine produces rapid and significant antidepressant effects in approximately 65% of patients suffering from treatment-resistant bipolar depression (BD). The genetic, pharmacological and biochemical differences between ketamine responders and non-responders have not been identified. The purpose of this study was to employ a metabolomics approach, a global, non-targeted determination of endogenous metabolic patterns, to identify potential markers of ketamine response and non-response. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: Plasma samples from 22 BD patients were analyzed to produce metabolomic patterns. The patients had received ketamine in a placebo-controlled crossover study and the samples were obtained 230 min post-administration at which time the patients were categorized as responders or non-responders. Matching plasma samples from the placebo arm of the study were also analysed. During the study, the patients were maintained on either lithium or valproate. KEY RESULTS: The metabolomic patterns were significantly different between the patients maintained on lithium and those maintained on valproate, irrespective of response to ketamine. In the patients maintained on lithium, 18 biomarkers were identified. In responders, lysophosphatidylethanolamines (4) and lysophosphatidylcholines (9) were increased relative to non-responders. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: The results indicate that the differences between patients who respond to ketamine and those who do not are due to alterations in the mitochondrial β-oxidation of fatty acids. These differences were not produced by ketamine administration. The data indicate that pretreatment metabolomics screening may be a guide to the prediction of response and a potential approach to the individualization of ketamine therapy."
"7011","1","Randomized, double-blind study of flexibly-dosed intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant vs. active control in treatment-resistant depression.^
Background: About 30% of the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to achieve remission despite treatment with multiple antidepressant medications, and are considered to have treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). New treatment options for TRD patients are needed. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching adult patients with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they had not responded) to intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms. Methods: This was a Phase 3, double‐blind, active‐controlled, multicenter study (NCT02418585) using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, and the United States from August 2015 to June 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate‐to‐severe, non‐psychotic, recurrent or persistent (single episode) depression, and history of non‐response to ≥2 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with 1 of them assessed prospectively. The non‐responders to standard‐of‐care treatment were randomized (1:1) to flexibly‐dosed intranasal esketamine (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) and a new oral antidepressant (given daily) or to a new oral antidepressant and intranasal placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint – change from baseline to endpoint (day 28) in Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score – was assessed among patients who received ≥1 dose of (intranasal and oral) study medication by a mixed‐effects model using repeated measures. Remission rate, a secondary endpoint, was assessed using Generalized Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for country and class of oral antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) as a post hoc analysis. Results: 435 patients were screened, 227 randomized, and 197 completed the double‐blind period. Change (LS mean [SE] difference vs. placebo) in MADRS total score with intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant was superior to oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo at day 28 (‐4.0 [1.69], 95% CI: ‐7.31, ‐0.64; 1‐sided p=0.010), as well as at earlier timepoints (1‐sided p≤0.009 at 24 hours postdose and days 8 and 22). Remission rate (MADRS total score ≤12) at day 28 was 52.5% (53/101) and 31.0% (31/100) for the respective groups (1‐sided p=0.001), with the number needed to treat (NNT) (95% CI) for remission of 5 (1.8; 7.5). The most common adverse events reported for the esketamine plus oral antidepressant group were dysgeusia, nausea, vertigo, and dizziness; the incidence of each (20.9‐26.1%) was >2‐fold higher than for the oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo group. Conclusions: Robust efficacy of intranasal esketamine and superiority to an active comparator were demonstrated on the primary efficacy endpoint result. More than half of the esketamine‐treated TRD patients achieved remission by the 4‐week endpoint. Favorable safety and tolerability of intranasal esketamine reported in this study suggest a positive risk‐benefit profile of intranasal esketamine.

"2472","1","Psychiatric disorders and their correlates among young adult MDMA users in Ohio.^
This study describes the lifetime prevalence, correlates, and age of onset of selected psychiatric disorders among a community sample of MDMA users (n = 402), aged 18 to 30, in Ohio. Participants responded to interviewer-administered questionnaires, including sections of the computerized Diagnostic Interview Schedule for DSM-IV. Fifty-five percent of the sample had at least one lifetime disorder, with major depression (35.3%) and antisocial personality disorder (ASPD) (25.4%) the most common. Proportionately more women were diagnosed with depression, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), while proportionately more men were diagnosed with ASPD. Proportionately more non-White participants had attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (AD/HD). Higher levels of education were associated with proportionately less PTSD, ASPD, and AD/HD. Higher frequencies of MDMA use were associated with proportionately more ASPD and AD/HD. Comparing the age of first MDMA use with the age of onset for selected psychiatric disorders revealed that for most participants disorders preceded use. Multivariate analysis revealed participants with more than a high school education were less likely to have experienced a lifetime disorder, while those who had used MDMA more than 50 times were more likely. Variations in the prevalence of psychiatric disorders have practical implications for drug abuse prevention and treatment programs."

The neurometabolic effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin (PSI; 0.2 mg/kg), the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE; 2 mg/kg) and the stimulant d-methamphetamine (METH; 0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and the drugs' interactions with a prefrontal activation task were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucoseFDG-positron emission tomographicPET study (each group: n = 8). Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand. The MDE data support the hypothesis that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class, which takes an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens."
"3425","1","Acute psychological and physiological effects of psilocybin in healthy humans: a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-effect study.^
RATIONALE: Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors play an important role in perception, affect regulation and attention. Pharmacological challenge with the 5-HT(2A) agonist psilocybin (PY) is useful in studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and consciousness. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of dose-dependent effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical and physiological parameters. METHODS: Eight subjects received placebo (PL), and 45 (""very low dose, VLD""), 115 (""low dose, LD""), 215 (""medium dose, MD""), and 315 (""high dose, HD"") microg/kg body weight PY. The ""Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale"" (5D-ASC), the ""Frankfurt Attention Inventory"" (FAIR), and the ""Adjective Mood Rating Scale"" (AMRS) were used to assess the effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical core dimensions, attention, and mood. A 24-h electrocardiogram (EKG) was recorded and blood pressure was measured. Plasma concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and standard clinical chemical parameters were determined. RESULTS: PY dose dependently increased scores of all 5D-ASC core dimensions. Only one subject reacted with transient anxiety to HD PY. Compared with PL, MD and HD PY led to a 50% reduction of performance in the FAIR test. ""General inactivation"", ""emotional excitability"", and ""dreaminess"" were the only domains of the AMRS showing increased scores following MD and HD PY. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was moderately elevated only 60 min following administration of HD PY. Neither EKG nor body temperature was affected by any dose of PY. TSH, ACTH, and CORT plasma levels were elevated during peak effects of HD PY, whereas PRL plasma levels were increased following MD and HD PY. CONCLUSION: PY affects core dimensions of altered states of consciousness and physiological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Our study provided no cause for concern that PY is hazardous with respect to somatic health."
"7253","1","Ketamine as a potential treatment for suicidal ideation: a systematic review of the literature.^
OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of suicidal ideation (SI). METHODS: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched up to January 2015 for clinical trials and case reports describing therapeutic ketamine administration to patients presenting with SI/suicidality. Searches were also conducted for relevant background material regarding the pharmacological function of ketamine. RESULTS: Nine publications (six studies and three case reports) met the search criteria for assessing SI after administration of subanesthetic ketamine. There were no studies examining the effect on suicide attempts or death by suicide. Each study demonstrated a rapid and clinically significant reduction in SI, with results similar to previously described data on ketamine and treatment-resistant depression. A total of 137 patients with SI have been reported in the literature as receiving therapeutic ketamine. Seven studies delivered a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenously over 40 min, while one study administered a 0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and another study administered a liquid suspension. The earliest significant results were seen after 40 min, and the longest results were observed up to 10 days postinfusion. CONCLUSION: Consistent with clinical research on ketamine as a rapid and effective treatment for depression, ketamine has shown early preliminary evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms, as well as reducing SI, with minimal short-term side effects. Additional studies are needed to further investigate its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, and long-term adverse effects (including abuse) and benefits. In addition, ketamine could potentially be used as a prototype for further development of rapid-acting antisuicidal medication with a practical route of administration and the most favorable risk/benefit ratio."
"6377","1","The Psychedelic Debriefing in Alcohol Dependence Treatment: Illustrating Key Change Phenomena through Qualitative Content Analysis of Clinical Sessions.^
Research on the clinical applications of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated promising early results for treatment of alcohol dependence. Detailed description of the content and methods of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, as it is conducted in clinical settings, is scarce. Methods: An open-label pilot (proof-of-concept) study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence (NCT01534494) was conducted to generate data for a phase 2 RCT (NCT02061293) of a similar treatment in a larger population. The present paper presents a qualitative content analysis of the 17 debriefing sessions conducted in the pilot study, which occurred the day after corresponding psilocybin medication sessions. Results: Participants articulated a series of key phenomena related to change in drinking outcomes and acute subjective effects of psilocybin. Discussion: The data illuminate change processes in patients' own words during clinical sessions, shedding light on potential therapeutic mechanisms of change and how participants express effects of psilocybin. This study is unique in analyzing actual clinical sessions, as opposed to interviews of patients conducted separately from treatment."

This Special Issue of Neuropharmacology on psychedelics provides a timely and comprehensive update on progress following the previous Neuropharmacology Special Issue ""Psychedelics: New Doors, Altered Perceptions"". Remarkable advances have been made in basic and clinical research on psychedelics in the five years since 2018. It is partly based on the seminar series focused on psilocybin organized by the National Institutes of Health (NIH), USA from April to June 2021, the ""NIH Psilocybin Research Speaker Series"". Participants were world leading experts, including scientists, medical practitioners, clinical psychologists and oncologists, and attendees from additional disciplines of patient advocacy, law, government science policy and regulatory policy. To provide a global perspective, their contributions are complemented with reviews by some of the world's most eminent scientists in the field. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted two breakthrough therapy designations for psilocybin in treatment resistant depression (TRD) in 2018 and major depressive disorder (MDD) in 2019, as well as for MDMA for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in 2017. Clinical trials are in progress to assess the therapeutic value of psilocybin in MDD and TRD, and in other indications such as cancer-related anxiety and depression, anorexia, PTSD, substance use disorders and various types of chronic pain. The contributors' insights should assist basic and applied science for transition of psychedelics from bench to potential mainstream therapies. The implications are global, because FDA approval of these new medicines will increase international interest and efforts."
"2785","0","Comparison of acute lethal toxicity of commonly abused psychoactive substances.^
AIMS: To determine the acute lethal toxicity of a range of psychoactive substances in terms of the dose customarily used as a single substance for non-medical purposes. DESIGN AND METHOD: A structured English-language literature search was conducted to identify experimental studies and clinical reports that documented human and non-human lethal doses of 20 abused substances that are distributed widely in Europe and North America. Four inclusion criteria were specified for the reports, and approximately 3000 relevant records were retrieved from search engines at Biosis, Science Citation Index, Google and the National Library of Medicine's Gateway. In order to account for different drug potencies, a 'safety ratio' was computed for each substance by comparing its reported acute lethal dose with the dose most commonly used for non-medical purposes. FINDINGS: The majority of published reports of acute lethal toxicity indicate that the decedent used a co-intoxicant (most often alcohol). The calculated safety ratios varied between substances by more than a factor of 100. Intravenous heroin appeared to have the greatest direct physiological toxicity; several hallucinogens appeared to have the least direct physiological toxicity. CONCLUSIONS: Despite residual uncertainties, the substantial difference in safety ratios suggests that abused substances can be rank-ordered on the basis of their potential acute lethality."
"77","1","Dose-related effects of ketamine for antidepressant-resistant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans and active duty military: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trial.^
This study tested the efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine doses to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans and service members with PTSD (n = 158) who failed previous antidepressant treatment were randomized to 8 infusions administered twice weekly of intravenous placebo (n = 54), low dose (0.2 mg/kg; n = 53) or standard dose (0.5 mg/kg; n = 51) ketamine. Participants were assessed at baseline, during treatment, and for 4 weeks after their last infusion. Primary analyses used mixed effects models. The primary outcome measure was the self-report PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and secondary outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). There were no significant group-by-time interactions for PTSD symptoms measured by the PCL-5 or CAPS-5. The standard ketamine dose ameliorated depression measured by the MADRS significantly more than placebo. Ketamine produced dose-related dissociative and psychotomimetic effects, which returned to baseline within 2 h and were less pronounced with repeated administration. There was no evidence of differential treatment discontinuation by ketamine dose, consistent with good tolerability. This clinical trial failed to find a significant dose-related effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses suggested that the standard dose exerted rapid antidepressant effects. Further studies are needed to determine the role of ketamine in PTSD treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02655692."
"3791","1","Course of improvement in depressive symptoms to a single intravenous infusion of ketamine vs add-on riluzole: results from a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^
The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD); these effects have been reported to last for 1 week in some patients. However, the extent and duration of this antidepressant effect over longer periods has not been well characterized under controlled conditions. Riluzole, a glutamatergic modulator with antidepressant and synaptic plasticity-enhancing effects, could conceivably be used to promote the antidepressant effects of ketamine. This study sought to determine the extent and time course of antidepressant improvement to a single-ketamine infusion over 4 weeks, comparing the addition of riluzole vs placebo after the infusion. Forty-two subjects (18-65) with TRD and a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of ≥ 22 received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Four to six hours post-infusion, subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment with either riluzole (100-200 mg/day; n=21) or placebo (n=21) for 4 weeks. Depressive symptoms were rated daily. A significant improvement (P<0.001) in MADRS scores from baseline was found. The effect size of improvement with ketamine was initially large and remained moderate throughout the 28-day trial. Overall, 27% of ketamine responders had not relapsed by 4 weeks following a single ketamine infusion. The average time to relapse was 13.2 days (SE=2.2). However, the difference between the riluzole and placebo treatment groups was not significant, suggesting that the combination of riluzole with ketamine treatment did not significantly alter the course of antidepressant response to ketamine alone."
"7457","1","LSD alters eyes-closed functional connectivity within the early visual cortex in a retinotopic fashion.^
The question of how spatially organized activity in the visual cortex behaves during eyes-closed, lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced ""psychedelic imagery"" (e.g., visions of geometric patterns and more complex phenomena) has never been empirically addressed, although it has been proposed that under psychedelics, with eyes-closed, the brain may function ""as if"" there is visual input when there is none. In this work, resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) data was analyzed from 10 healthy subjects under the influence of LSD and, separately, placebo. It was suspected that eyes-closed psychedelic imagery might involve transient local retinotopic activation, of the sort typically associated with visual stimulation. To test this, it was hypothesized that, under LSD, patches of the visual cortex with congruent retinotopic representations would show greater RSFC than incongruent patches. Using a retinotopic localizer performed during a nondrug baseline condition, nonadjacent patches of V1 and V3 that represent the vertical or the horizontal meridians of the visual field were identified. Subsequently, RSFC between V1 and V3 was measured with respect to these a priori identified patches. Consistent with our prior hypothesis, the difference between RSFC of patches with congruent retinotopic specificity (horizontal-horizontal and vertical-vertical) and those with incongruent specificity (horizontal-vertical and vertical-horizontal) increased significantly under LSD relative to placebo, suggesting that activity within the visual cortex becomes more dependent on its intrinsic retinotopic organization in the drug condition. This result may indicate that under LSD, with eyes-closed, the early visual system behaves as if it were seeing spatially localized visual inputs.

AIMS: Cell-mediated immune function and the occurrence of mild infectious diseases was investigated. Participants Polydrug consumers of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and cannabis (n = 37) compared to cannabis users only (n = 23) and control group (n = 34). DESIGN: A longitudinal prospective study with three cross-sectional evaluations at time 0 and at 6 months and 1 year was performed. FINDINGS: At baseline, a significant decrease in interleukin (IL)-2 and an increase in anti-inflammatory transforming growth factor (TGF)-beta1, together with a decrease in the number of total lymphocytes, CD4 and natural killer (NK) cells were observed in the MDMA-cannabis group, with intermediate alterations in the cannabis group. Immune alterations observed at baseline were sustained over time. No differences were found between regular and occasional MDMA users. A significantly higher rate of mild infections in regular MDMA-cannabis users compared with occasional MDMA-cannabis users and the remaining groups was observed. CONCLUSIONS: The present data confirm that long-term alterations in immunological homeostasis may result in general health status impairment and subsequent increased susceptibility to infection and immune-related disorders."

This study was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I‐II patients aged 30‐50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 ‐10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16‐gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2 saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a 25‐gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2‐3 or L3‐4 interspaces. Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30 patients each: ‐ The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. ‐ The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally. ‐ Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5‐2 µg/kg, propofol 2‐3 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis‐atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1‐ 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis‐atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative. VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS ≥ 3) followed by 1 mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient‐care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required. Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine 0.01 mg/kg."
"8560","0","Use of new psychoactive substances among the general population in Croatia: Patterns of use and sociodemographic characteristics of users.^
The aim of this study is to provide information on the prevalence of new psychoactive substances (NPS) use among the general population in Croatia, patterns of NPS use and characteristics of NPS users. The data on NPS use, patterns of NPS use, licit and illicit substance use, and general information on participants, were gathered by empirical research on a nationally representative sample of Croatian adults aged 15-64 years (N = 4992). Lifetime prevalence of NPS use in Croatia was 2.7%, and last year 1.3%. The most common form of NPS used was herbal smoking mixtures (76.2%), and most users have been given or bought NPS from a friend (69%). Most NPS users were male (75.4%), young adults between 15-34 years (75.8%), single (73.1%), had a high school education (68%), and currently were either high school or university students (39.4%), employed (33.1%) or self-employed (7.2%). NPS users have reported very high prevalence of use of licit (79.5% tobacco, 89.9% alcohol, and 57.5% had an episode of binge drinking) and illicit substances (55.6%, most commonly cannabis) over the month preceding the survey. High lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use was found for amphetamines (42.5%), ecstasy (35.4%), LSD (24.6%), and cocaine (23.9%). In Croatia, the lifetime prevalence of NPS use is relatively low among the general population. Most NPS users are single young males who exhibit patterns of polydrug use. Due to serious risks associated with NPS use, prevention should be one of the national drug policy priorities."
"2552","1","The effect of single administration of intravenous ketamine augmentation on suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: Results from a randomized double-blind study.^
This study aimed to assess the effect of a single infusion of intravenous (IV) ketamine on suicidal ideation in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Patients with TRD were randomized in a double-blind fashion to a single infusion of IV ketamine or IV midazolam placebo. Suicidal ideation was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) suicide item at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days post infusion. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was defined as a MADRS suicide item score ≥2. Forty patients who received IV ketamine and 16 who received IV midazolam had suicide item scores of ≥2 at baseline (IV ketamine group mean 2.90±0.74; IV midazolam group 2.69±0.70). The mean suicide scores of these groups differed significantly from each other on day 30; the IV ketamine group had a lower mean score than controls (2.03±1.59 vs. 3.00±1.41, t-test p = 0.049; Hedges' g 0.71). Among patients with a suicide score of ≥2 at baseline and <2 at day 3, the two groups did not differ significantly on mean scores changes at days 3, 5, 7, 14 or 30. Recurrence of suicidal ideation was extensive in both treatment groups. A single infusion of IV ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in TRD out to 30 days post infusion, but early anti-suicidal effects appear to diminish rapidly. This post-hoc analysis was not powered to compare different doses of ketamine. A single infusion of IV ketamine might have a role as an adjunct to standard treatments in patients with TRD and suicidal ideation. Trial registration: NCT01920555."
"684","0","Ketamine treatment for depression: A model of care.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine and related compounds are emerging as rapidly acting therapies for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine differs from standard antidepressants in its speed of action, specific acute and cumulative side effects, risk of dependence and regulatory requirements. However, there is currently little guidance offering translation from research studies into clinical practice. We therefore detail a comprehensive model of care for ketamine treatment of depression. METHOD: We formulated a set of policies and procedures for a 'compassionate use' ketamine programme that developed out of our clinical research in ketamine. These policies and procedures were formulated into a detailed model of care. RESULTS: The current Australian and New Zealand regulatory frameworks and professional bodies' recommendations regarding ketamine are detailed along with clinical governance and infrastructure considerations. We next describe a four-step model comprising initial assessment, pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment phases. The model comprises thorough psychiatric and medical assessments examining patient suitability, a rigorous consenting process and structured safety monitoring across an acute treatment course or maintenance therapy. Our ketamine dose-titration method is detailed allowing flexible dosing of patients across a treatment course enabling individualised treatment. CONCLUSION: The model of care aims to bridge the gap between efficacy studies and clinical care outside of research settings as ketamine and related compounds become increasingly important therapies for treatment-resistant depression."
"4458","1","Psilocybin-induced spiritual experiences and insightfulness are associated with synchronization of neuronal oscillations.^
RATIONALE: During the last years, considerable progress has been made toward understanding the neuronal basis of consciousness by using sophisticated behavioral tasks, brain-imaging techniques, and various psychoactive drugs. Nevertheless, the neuronal mechanisms underlying some of the most intriguing states of consciousness, including spiritual experiences, remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate state of consciousness-related neuronal mechanisms, human subjects were given psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonergic agonist and hallucinogen that has been used for centuries to induce spiritual experiences in religious and medical rituals. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy human volunteers received a moderate dose of psilocybin, while high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The current source density and the lagged phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions were computed and correlated with psilocybin-induced altered states of consciousness. RESULTS: Psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations at 1.5-20 Hz within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions. Most intriguingly, the intensity levels of psilocybin-induced spiritual experience and insightfulness correlated with the lagged phase synchronization of delta oscillations (1.5-4 Hz) between the retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus, and the lateral orbitofrontal area. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide systematic evidence for the direct association of a specific spatiotemporal neuronal mechanism with spiritual experiences and enhanced insight into life and existence. The identified mechanism may constitute a pathway for modulating mental health, as spiritual experiences can promote sustained well-being and psychological resilience."
"9544","1","Gender differences in abusers of amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine in southwestern China.^
The objective of this study was to investigate abuse conditions of new-type drugs for users who are seeking treatment, gender differences, and differences between the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) users and mixed amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine (ATS. +. K) poly-drug users. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with a final diagnosis of the substance use disorder according to the Diagnoses and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) who underwent treatment for exposure to new-type drugs at the mental health center of the West China Hospital from March 2009 to May 2011. A questionnaire was used to collect information about socio-demographics, drug abuse conditions and psychiatric co-morbidities. Male subjects were older (p=0.026), had low level education (p=0.003), were less previously married (p<0.001), were more likely to be employed and to hold higher status jobs (p=0.007); 77.1% of subjects had a psychotic disorder, 28.0% of subjects had a mood disorder, 39.7% had an anxiety disorder, and 45.0% had a cognitive impairment disorder. More men used methamphetamine MA (p<0.001), tobacco (p=0.014) and more than one drug substance (p=0.004) compared to women; women were more vulnerable to mood disorders (p=0.034) than men. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA (p<0.001) and develop more psychotic disorders (p=0.04) than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (p=0.002), alcohol (p=0.014) and develop more cognitive impairment disorder (p=0.034). The present study found that the new-type drug patients have a high degree of psychiatric morbidities; more men were using MA, tobacco and multi-substance and more women patients experience mood disorder in the gender differences. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and develop more psychotic disorders than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA, alcohol and develop more cognitive impairment disorder. These results suggested that the psychiatrists should focus on the mood disorder among females, psychotic disorders among males who abuse ATS and ketamine, and cognitive impairment disorder for the females who abuse ATS and ketamine. © 2012."
"2208","1","Psilocybin Induces Aberrant Prediction Error Processing of Tactile Mismatch Responses - A Simultaneous EEG-FMRI Study.^
As source of sensory information, the body provides a sense of agency and self/non-self-discrimination. The integration of bodily states and sensory inputs with prior beliefs has been linked to the generation of bodily self-consciousness. The ability to detect surprising tactile stimuli is essential for the survival of an organism and for the formation of mental body representations. Despite the relevance for a variety of psychiatric disorders characterized by altered body and self-perception, the neurobiology of these processes is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effect of psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self-experience, on tactile mismatch responses by combining pharmacological manipulations with simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recording. Psi reduced activity in response to tactile surprising stimuli in frontal regions, the visual cortex, and the cerebellum. Furthermore, Psi reduced tactile mismatch negativity EEG responses at frontal electrodes, associated with alterations of body- and self-experience. This study provides first evidence that Psi alters the integration of tactile sensory inputs through aberrant prediction error processing and highlights the importance of the 5-HT2A system in tactile deviancy processing as well as in the integration of bodily and self-related stimuli. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant bodily self-awareness."
"6321","1","Psychotomimetic effects of single-dose ketamine in children: exploring effects of age and alpha-2 agonist pretreatment.^
Background: Sub‐anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonist drugs have been used for conscious sedation and treatment of pain and depression in humans, including clinical use in children for burn management and fracture reductions where ketamine offers less respiratory depression than a commonly used combination of midazolam‐fentanyl. However, NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent, transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children. Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade ‐along with limited clinical observations‐ suggest 1) that NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent (i.e., expressed postpuberty) and 2) that certain treatments ‐like alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists‐ may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity, with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha‐2 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects. We report on a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of the effect of the alpha‐2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single‐dose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department (ED) setting. The study hypothesized 1) ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects, and 2) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a) younger age and b) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine. Methods: Children ages 7‐17 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized (stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of <12 vs. >12 years‐of‐age children in each group) to co‐administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures. Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg), medical assessments, patient stabilization, and informed consent, participants were administered dexmedetomidine (0.7 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine. Adverse events were recorded using a clinician‐administered adverse events and side effects scale. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) was administered prior to ketamine dose, during ketamine treatment, and again prior to discharge from the emergency room, with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre‐ketamine to on‐ketamine condition. Cognitive testing was obtained following on‐ketamine BPRS ratings. Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA (ANCOVA when baseline values were non‐zero), using time as the repeated measure (pre‐ vs. during ketamine), and treatment condition (dexmedetomidine vs. saline) and age (<12 vs. >12) as independent variables. Results: Forty children (mean age: 11.0 years (SD = 2.3 years), 70.0% male, 22.5% black) were randomized to ketamine+saline (n =18) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine (n= 22). Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects, consistent with prior reports of dose‐dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans. BPRS positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, peculiar fantasies), absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment, were manifested during ketamine treatment, as indicated by a significant main effect of time (F[1,36] =19.98, p<0.0001). A trend‐level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed (F[1,36]=3.93, p =0.055), explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre‐treatment. Frequently reported (>5%, baseline‐corrected) side effects were sedation (56.3%), dizziness (50.0%), “pleasant” dreams (31.4%) and visual hallucinations (29.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that singledose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well‐controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures, with generally well‐tolerated adverse events, consistent with prior reports. However, ketamine treatment in children, as in adults, is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2) that pretreatment with alpha‐2 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain. Future studies are needed to better characterize these effects."
"8038","1","Motor delays in MDMA (ecstasy) exposed infants persist to 2 years.^
Background: Recreational use of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy, MDMA) is increasing worldwide. Its use by pregnant women causes concern due to potentially harmful effects on the developing fetus. MDMA, an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor, affects the serotonin and dopamine systems. Preclinical studies of fetal exposure demonstrate effects on learning, motor behavior, and memory. In the first human studies, we found prenatal MDMA exposure related to poorer motor development in the first year of life. In the present study we assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to MDMA on the trajectory of child development through 2 years of age. We hypothesized that exposure would be associated with poorer mental and motor outcomes. Materials and Methods: The DAISY (Drugs and Infancy Study, 2003-2008) employed a prospective longitudinal cohort design to assess recreational drug use during pregnancy and child outcomes in the United Kingdom. Examiners masked to drug exposures followed infants from birth to 4, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. MDMA, cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other drugs were quantified through a standardized clinical interview. The Bayley Scales (III) of Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development and the Behavior Rating Scales (BRS) were primary outcome measures. Statistical analyses included a repeated measures mixed model approach controlling for multiple confounders. Results: Participants were pregnant women volunteers, primarily white, of middle class socioeconomic status, average IQ, with some college education, in stable partner relationships. Of 96 women enrolled, children of 93 had at least one follow-up assessment and 81 (87%) had ≥ two assessments. Heavier MDMA exposure (= 1.3 ± 1.4 tablets per week) predicted lower PDI (< .002), and poorer BRS motor quality from 4 to 24 months of age, but did not affect MDI, orientation, or emotional regulation. Children with heavier exposure were twice as likely to demonstrate poorer motor quality as lighter and non-exposed children (O.R. = 2.2, 95%, CI = 1.02-4.70, p < .05). Discussion: Infants whose mothers reported heavier MDMA use during pregnancy had motor delays from 4 months to two years of age that were not attributable to other drug or lifestyle factors. Women of child bearing age should be cautioned about the use of MDMA and MDMA-exposed infants should be screened for motor delays and possible intervention."
"5398","1","Effects of nicotine on the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of ketamine in humans.^
Background: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its associated neurocognitive impairments. The high rate of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia raises questions about how nicotine modulates putative NMDA receptor hypofunction in the illness. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation on NMDA receptor hypofunction by examining the interactive effects of nicotine, a nAChR agonist, and ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on behavioral and neurophysiological measures in healthy human volunteers. Methods: From an initial sample of 17 subjects (age range 18–55 years), 8 subjects successfully completed 4 test sessions, each separated by at least 3 days, during which they received ketamine or placebo and two injections of nicotine or placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced manner. Schizophrenia-like effects Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, perceptual alterations Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale, subjective effects Visual Analog Scale and auditory event-related brain potentials (mismatch negativity, MMN; P300) were assessed during each test session. Results: Consistent with existing studies, ketamine induced transient schizophrenia-like behavioral effects. P300 was reduced and delayed by ketamine regardless of whether it was elicited by a target (P3b) or novel (P3a) stimulus, while nicotine only reduced the amplitude of P3a. Nicotine did not rescue P300 from the effects of ketamine; the interactions of ketamine and nicotine were not significant. While nicotine significantly reduced MMN amplitude, ketamine did not. Conclusion: Nicotine failed to modulate ketamine-induced neurophysiological and behavioral effects in this preliminary study. Interestingly, ketamine reduced P3b amplitude and nicotine reduced P3a amplitude, suggesting independent roles of NMDA receptor and nAChR in the generation of P3b and P3a, respectively.

The aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) administration on arginine vasopressin (AVP) release. (R,S)-MDMA (40 mg) was administered to eight normally hydrated healthy male volunteers (22-32 years) and blood samples were collected up to 24 h. Plasma was assayed for AVP and cortisol by radioimmunoassays, and for MDMA and the N-demethylated metabolite, MDA, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sodium concentrations and osmolality were also determined. Plasma AVP increased in all subjects after MDMA administration and a significant negative correlation was observed between concentrations of AVP and both single and total enantiomer MDMA at 1 h (r < -0.91, P < 0.01). This had disappeared by 2 h (P > 0.7). Compared with basal values, no significant change was observed for osmolality or cortisol at 1 h after drug administration. In conclusion, plasma AVP concentrations increase after MDMA administration, but the increase is not part of a generalized stress response since cortisol did not increase concurrently. A significant negative correlation between plasma MDMA and AVP was observed soon after administration. The possibility that a pharmacological effect of MDMA is primarily mediated via one or more metabolites, rather than by the parent drug, should be considered."

Background: Pharmacological-assisted psychotherapies, using conventional and novel drug agents, are increasingly being used both in clinical and experimental research settings, respectively. Objective: To determine the efficacy of conventional and novel pharmacological-assisted psychotherapies in reducing PTSD symptom severity. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials were undertaken; 21 studies were included. Results: MDMA-assisted therapy was found to statistically superior to active and inactive placebo-assisted therapy in reduction of PTSD symptoms (standardised mean difference -1.09, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.58). There was no evidence of superiority over placebo for any other intervention. Conclusions: MDMA-assisted therapy demonstrated an impressive effect size; however, it is difficult to have confidence at this stage in this intervention due to the small numbers of participants included, and more research in this area is needed. There was no evidence to support the efficacy of any other drug-assisted interventions."

The present study aimed to explore the hypothesis in rats depression model that, (1) low dose of ketamine enhance the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive shock (ECS, analog of ECT in animals) under propofol anesthesia ; (2) the low dose of ketamine and propofol have synergistic effect to alleviate the learning and memory function impairment caused by ECS; (3) the protective effect of low dose of ketamine and propofol on the learning-memory function in ECS. Healthy male adult Sprague-Dawley rats, weighed 200–250 g, aged 2–3 months, were used for the experiment. A group of 10 healthy male rats (with same age and weight) were set as the control group (group C).

Background and aims: Few studies have examined whether subjective experiences during first cannabis use are related to other illicit drug (OID) use. This study investigated this topic. Methods: Baseline data from a representative sample of young Swiss men was obtained from an ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (N=5753). Logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationships between cannabis use and of subjective experiences during first cannabis use with 15 OID. Results: Positive experiences increased the likelihood of using hallucinogens (hallucinogens, salvia divinorum, spice; p<0.015), stimulants (speed, ecstasy, cocaine, amphetamines/methamphetamines; p<0.006) and also poppers, research chemicals, GHB/GBL, and crystal meth (p<0.049). Sniffed drugs (poppers, solvents for sniffing) and ""hard"" drugs (heroin, ketamine, research chemicals, GHB/GBL and crystal meth) were more likely to be used by participants who experienced negative feelings on first use of cannabis (p<0.034). Conclusion: Subjective feelings seemed to amplify the association of cannabis with OID. The risk increased for drugs with effects resembling feelings experienced on first cannabis use. Negative experiences should also be a concern, as they were associated with increased risk of using the ""hardest"" illicit drugs."

Objectives The aim of this retrospective study was to determine whether there is a difference in oral health between recreational ecstasy users and non-recreational drug users.Study design In a cross-sectional study, dental records of 149 individuals visiting an academic dental clinic in Amsterdam who reported recreational ecstasy use, defined as no more than twice a week, were systematically analysed and compared to a group of age- and sex-matched non-drug users randomly selected from this institute. The parameters retrieved from the dental records were decayed, missed and filled teeth index (DMFT), number of endodontically treated teeth, presence of active caries lesions, periodontitis, tooth wear, xerostomia and self-reported use of oral hygiene devices.Results Periodontitis, active caries lesions and xerostomia were statistically significantly more present in ecstasy users. Ecstasy users brush their teeth significant less frequently per day than non-recreational drug users. There were no significant differences in DMFT and in the devices used for brushing/interdental cleaning and frequency of use of these interdental devices between both groups.Conclusion Periodontitis, active caries lesions and xerostomia are more frequently present in recreational ecstasy users compared to age- and sex-matched non-users."
"5047","1","Baseline insomnia as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy to repeated intravenous ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression: A preliminary study.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects, and few studies have focused on the relationship between insomnia and the efficacy of ketamine. The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression. METHOD: Patients with high insomnia (n = 64) or low insomnia (n = 68) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) without sleep item was used to assess depressive symptoms. Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50%, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10. RESULT: There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia. However, the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission. Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia. A linear mixed model showed that the high insomnia subgroup had greater improvement than the low insomnia subgroup (all p < 0.05). LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: When given six ketamine infusions, patients with high insomnia were more likely to respond and remit than those with low insomnia. Patients with high insomnia showed not only a shorter latency to respond and remit, but also greater improvement than those with low insomnia."
"98","1","Validation of ketamine as a pharmacological model of thalamic dysconnectivity across the illness course of schizophrenia.^
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is a leading pathophysiological model of schizophrenia. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies demonstrate a thalamic dysconnectivity pattern in schizophrenia involving excessive connectivity with sensory regions and deficient connectivity with frontal, cerebellar, and thalamic regions. The NMDAR antagonist ketamine, when administered at sub-anesthetic doses to healthy volunteers, induces transient schizophrenia-like symptoms and alters rsfMRI thalamic connectivity. However, the extent to which ketamine-induced thalamic dysconnectivity resembles schizophrenia thalamic dysconnectivity has not been directly tested. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled study derived an NMDAR hypofunction model of thalamic dysconnectivity from healthy volunteers undergoing ketamine infusions during rsfMRI. To assess whether ketamine-induced thalamic dysconnectivity was mediated by excess glutamate release, we tested whether pre-treatment with lamotrigine, a glutamate release inhibitor, attenuated ketamine's effects. Ketamine produced robust thalamo-cortical hyper-connectivity with sensory and motor regions that was not reduced by lamotrigine pre-treatment. To test whether the ketamine thalamic dysconnectivity pattern resembled the schizophrenia pattern, a whole-brain template representing ketamine's thalamic dysconnectivity effect was correlated with individual participant rsfMRI thalamic dysconnectivity maps, generating ""ketamine similarity coefficients"" for people with chronic (SZ) and early illness (ESZ) schizophrenia, individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and healthy controls (HC). Similarity coefficients were higher in SZ and ESZ than in HC, with CHR-P showing an intermediate trend. Higher ketamine similarity coefficients correlated with greater hallucination severity in SZ. Thus, NMDAR hypofunction, modeled with ketamine, reproduces the thalamic hyper-connectivity observed in schizophrenia across its illness course, including the CHR-P period preceding psychosis onset, and may contribute to hallucination severity."

BackgroundThere are currently relatively few effective pharmacological treatments for obesity, and existing ones may be associated with limiting side-effects. In the search for novel anti-obesity agents, drugs that modify central serotonergic systems have historically proven to be effective in promoting weight loss. Psilocin, which is rapidly metabolized from psilocybin, is an agonist at multiple serotonin receptors. In the present study we assessed the effects of psilocybin and a positive control (metformin) on changes in body weight in a rat model of obesity. MethodsFive groups of adult male rats were pre-conditioned with a cafeteria diet until obese (>600 g) and then treated with either psilocybin (0.1, 1, or 5 mg/kg, i.p.), metformin (300 mg/kg, p.o.) or vehicle control. Treatments were for 27 consecutive weekdays, and body weights and high calorie food intake were recorded daily. Fasting glucose levels were recorded after 11 days of treatment. At the end of treatment rats completed a glucose tolerance test, and multiple fat pads were dissected out to assess adiposity. ResultsThe medium dose psilocybin group had to be terminated from the study prematurely. Both the low and high dose psilocybin groups caused a significant decrease in changes in body weight compared to controls. The metformin group produced a greater decrease in change in body weight than either psilocybin groups or controls. Both high dose psilocybin and metformin decreased consumption of the high calorie diet, and exhibited decreased central adiposity. ConclusionPsilocybin demonstrated modest but significant effects on weight gain. Further study is recommended."
"5375","1","Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of depressive symptoms after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a general anaesthetic with anti-depressant effects at subanaesthetic doses. We hypothesised that intraoperative administration of ketamine would prevent or mitigate postoperative depressive symptoms in surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomised clinical trial testing the effects of intraoperative administration of ketamine [0.5 mg kg(-1) (Lo-K) or 1.0 mg kg(-1) (Hi-K)] vs control [saline placebo (P)] in patients ≥60 yr old undergoing major surgery with general anaesthesia. We administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 before the operation, on postoperative day (POD) 3 (primary outcome), and on POD30 to assess depressive symptoms, a secondary outcome of the original trial. RESULTS: There was no significant difference on POD3 in the proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of depression between the placebo [23/156 (14.7%)] and combined ketamine (Lo-K plus Hi-K) [61/349 (17.5%)] groups [difference = -2.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0% to -9.4%; P=0.446]. Of the total cohort, 9.6% (64/670; 95% CI, 7.6-12.0%) had symptoms suggestive of depression before operation, which increased to 16.6% (84/505; 95% CI, 13.6-20.1%) on POD3, and decreased to 11.9% (47/395; 95% CI, 9.1-15.5%) on POD30. Of the patients with depressive symptoms on POD3 and POD30, 51% and 49%, respectively, had no prior history of depression or depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Major surgery is associated with new-onset symptoms suggestive of depression in patients ≥60 yr old. Intraoperative administration of subanaesthetic ketamine does not appear to prevent or improve depressive symptoms. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01690988."
"9557","1","Recreational drug use among Chinese MSM and transgender individuals: Results from a national online cross-sectional study.^
Background: Recreational drug use has increased considerably among Chinese men who have sex with men (MSM). The phenomenon has the potentially to increase HIV transmission among Chinese MSM. The aims of this study were: 1) to investigate the prevalence of recreational drug use among Chinese MSM, and 2) to explore the correlation between gay smartphone based sex-seeking applications (gay apps), HIV/STIs testing, group sex, commercial sex, sexual roles and poppers use among Chinese MSM. Methods: MSM who were born biologically male, were at least 16 years of age and had engaged in anal sex with a man at least once were recruited through a nation-wide online survey in 2014. Information regarding socio-demographics, risk behaviors, recreational drug use, HIV and other STIs testing history and gay app use were collected. Univariate and multivariate analysis were used to determine factors associated with recreational drug use among Chinese MSM. Results: Among 1424 participating MSM, 1100 (77.3%) reported ever using recreational drugs in their lifetime. In the last 12 months, 303 (21.3%) used poppers, 34 (2.4%) used crystal meth and 15(1.0%) used ecstasy. The mean age of respondents was 25.6±6.8 years, 72.9% identified as gay, 41.3% were students, and 83.8% had never been married. Multiple logistic regression models revealed that compared with non-popper users, popper users were more likely to have been tested for HIV (adjusted OR (aOR) = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.15-1.96) and other STIs (aOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.26-2.17). In addition, popper users were more likely to engage in group sex (aOR = 2.63, 95% CI: 1.80-3.86), commercial sex (aOR = 1.86, 95% CI: 1.13-3.06) and used gay mobile apps to seek sexual partners (aOR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.58-2.80). Conclusion: Chinese MSM has a high rate of recreational drug use, including poppers. Public health programs serving MSM may consider integrating intervention programs to decrease recreational drug use related harms."

RATIONALE: Data on safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are lacking in dementia patients. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, we evaluated the safety, pharmacodynamics, and pharmacokinetics of THC in ten patients with dementia (mean age 77.3 ± 5.6). For 12 weeks, participants randomly received oral THC (weeks 1-6, 0.75 mg; weeks 7-12, 1.5 mg) or placebo twice daily for 3 days, separated by a 4-day washout period. RESULTS: Only 6 of the 98 reported adverse events were related to THC. Visual analog scale (VAS) feeling high, VAS external perception, body sway-eyes-open, and diastolic blood pressure were not significantly different with THC. After the 0.75-mg dose, VAS internal perception (0.025 units; 95% CI 0.010-0.040) and heart rate (2 beats/min; 95% CI 0.4-3.8) increased significantly. Body sway-eyes-closed increased only after 1.5 mg (0.59°/s; 95% CI 0.13-1.06). Systolic blood pressure changed significantly after both doses of THC (0.75 mg, -7 mmHg, 95% CI -11.4, -3.0; 1.5 mg, 5 mmHg, 95% CI 1.0-9.2). The median T max was 1-2 h, with THC pharmacokinetics increasing linearly with increasing dose, with wide interindividual variability (CV% up to 140%). The mean C max (ng/mL) after the first dose (0-6 h) was 0.41 (0.18-0.90) for the 0.75-mg dose and 1.01 (0.53-1.92) for the 1.5-mg dose. After the second dose (6-24 h), the C max was 0.50 (0.27-0.92) and 0.98 (0.46-2.06), respectively. CONCLUSIONS: THC was rapidly absorbed and had dose-linear pharmacokinetics with considerable interindividual variation. Pharmacodynamic effects, including adverse events, were minor. Further studies are warranted to evaluate the pharmacodynamics and efficacy of higher THC doses in older persons with dementia."
"8110","1","Patterns of polydrug use in Great Britain: Findings from a national household population survey.^
Background: Polydrug use potentially increases the likelihood of harm. As little is known about polydrug use patterns in the general population, it is difficult to determine patterns associated with highest likelihood. Methods: Latent class analysis was performed on nine illicit substance groups indicating past year use of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD, mushrooms, amyl nitrate, tranquillisers and heroin or crack. Analyses were based on data from a large multi-stage probability sample of the population of Great Britain (n= 8538) collected in 2000. Multinomial logistic regression was performed highlighting associations between classes, and demographic and mental health variables. Results: A three class solution best described patterns of polydrug use; wide range, moderate range, and no polydrug use. For males and young people, there was a significantly increased chance of being in the wide and moderate range polydrug use groups compared to the no polydrug use class. Hazardous drinking was more likely in the wide and moderate polydrug classes with odds ratios of 9.99 and 2.38 (respectively) compared to the no polydrug use class. Current smokers were more likely to be wide and moderate range polydrug users compared to the no polydrug use class with odds ratios of 4.53 and 5.85 respectively. A range of mental health variables were also related to class membership. Conclusions: Polydrug use in Great Britain can be expressed as three distinct classes. Hazardous alcohol use and tobacco use were strongly associated with illicit polydrug use, polydrug use appeared to be significantly associated with mental health, particularly lifetime suicide attempts. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
"120","1","Can 'floating' predict treatment response to ketamine? Data from three randomized trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.^
Ketamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects (SEs). Recent studies noted a positive correlation between treatment response to ketamine and general dissociative SEs, as well as ""floating"", a depersonalization SE (a subtype of the dissociative SEs). This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine. Data were pooled from three double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder) received placebo and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions. SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion. The hypothesis that a post-infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post-infusion and at Day 1. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model. Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores (p < 0.0001), but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. The hypothesized mediation effect of floating was also not detected at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. Taken together, the findings do not support the hypothesis that ketamine's antidepressant effects are mediated by the dissociative depersonalization subtype SE of floating."

"2884","0","[Rapid-acting antidepressants-neurobiological mechanisms of action].^
Rapid-acting antidepressants disprove the dogma that antidepressants need several weeks to become clinically effective. Ketamine, the prototype of a rapid-acting antidepressant, is an N‑methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocking agent. A single i.v. application of ketamine induces rapid changes in glutamatergic neurotransmitter systems, leading to preferential activation of glutamatergic alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors. This evokes the activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), causing plastic changes in the central nervous system within 24 h. In the prefrontal cortex ketamine leads to a regeneration of synaptic contacts, which have been damaged by chronic stress. This regeneration correlates with improvement of depression-like behavioral changes in rodent models. Classical monoaminergic antidepressants can cause similar changes but with considerably longer latency periods. For clinical application a nasal spray of esketamine has been developed, since this enantiomer has the highest affinity for NMDA receptors; however, since R‑ketamine and certain ketamine metabolites also have antidepressant effects in preclinical models, these are currently being tested in clinical studies. Moreover, there are many other glutamatergic substances under clinical investigation for antidepressant effects without ketamine-like adverse effects. In addition, there are also several promising rapid-acting antidepressants that do not primarily act via the glutamate system, such as the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor modulator brexanolone or the serotonin receptor agonist psilocybin."
"2341","0","Does cannabidiol make cannabis safer? A randomised, double-blind, cross-over trial of cannabis with four different CBD:THC ratios.^
As countries adopt more permissive cannabis policies, it is increasingly important to identify strategies that can reduce the harmful effects of cannabis use. This study aimed to determine if increasing the CBD content of cannabis can reduce its harmful effects. Forty-six healthy, infrequent cannabis users participated in a double-blind, within-subject, randomised trial of cannabis preparations varying in CBD content. There was an initial baseline visit followed by four drug administration visits, in which participants inhaled vaporised cannabis containing 10 mg THC and either 0 mg (0:1 CBD:THC), 10 mg (1:1), 20 mg (2:1), or 30 mg (3:1) CBD, in a randomised, counter-balanced order. The primary outcome was change in delayed verbal recall on the Hopkins Verbal Learning Task. Secondary outcomes included change in severity of psychotic symptoms (e.g., Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] positive subscale), plus further cognitive, subjective, pleasurable, pharmacological and physiological effects. Serial plasma concentrations of THC and CBD were measured. THC (0:1) was associated with impaired delayed verbal recall (t(45) = 3.399, d = 0.50, p = 0.001) and induced positive psychotic symptoms on the PANSS (t(45) = -4.709, d = 0.69, p = 2.41 × 10(-5)). These effects were not significantly modulated by any dose of CBD. Furthermore, there was no evidence of CBD modulating the effects of THC on other cognitive, psychotic, subjective, pleasurable, and physiological measures. There was a dose-response relationship between CBD dose and plasma CBD concentration, with no effect on plasma THC concentrations. At CBD:THC ratios most common in medicinal and recreational cannabis products, we found no evidence that CBD protects against the acute adverse effects of cannabis. This should be considered in health policy and safety decisions about medicinal and recreational cannabis."
"4683","1","Subanesthetic doses of ketamine stimulate psychosis in schizophrenia.^
We administered ketamine to schizophrenic individuals in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design using a range of subanesthetic doses (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) to evaluate the nature, dose characteristics, time course, and neuroleptic modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist action on mental status in schizophrenia. Ketamine induced a dose-related, short (< 30 minutes) worsening in mental status in the haloperidol-treated condition, reflected by a significant increase in BPRS total score for the 0.3 mg/kg (p = .005) and 0.5 mg/kg (p = .01) challenges. Positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), not negative symptoms accounted for these changes. These ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms were strikingly reminiscent of the subject's symptoms during active episodes of their illness. Results from six patients who were retested in the same design after being neuroleptic-free for 4 weeks failed to indicate that haloperidol blocks ketamine-induced psychosis. Several subjects evidenced delayed or prolonged (8-24 hours) psychotomimetic effects such as worsening of psychosis with visual hallucinations. These data suggest that antagonism of NMDA-sensitive glutamatergic transmission in brain exacerbates symptoms of schizophrenia."
"1804","1","Cocaine self-administration disrupted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine: a randomized, crossover trial.^
Repeated drug consumption may progress to problematic use by triggering neuroplastic adaptations that attenuate sensitivity to natural rewards while increasing reactivity to craving and drug cues. Converging evidence suggests a single sub-anesthetic dose of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine may work to correct these neuroadaptations and restore motivation for non-drug rewards. Using an established laboratory model aimed at evaluating behavioral shifts in the salience of cocaine now vs money later, we found that ketamine, as compared to the control, significantly decreased cocaine self-administration by 67% relative to baseline at greater than 24 h post-infusion, the most robust reduction observed to date in human cocaine users and the first to involve mechanisms other than stimulant or dopamine agonist effects. These findings signal new directions in medication development for substance use disorders."

Reports an error in 'Involvement of inferior parietal lobules in prospective memory impairment during acute MDMA (ecstasy) intoxication: An event-related fMRI study' by Johannes G. Ramaekers, Kim P. C. Kuypers, Marleen Wingen, Armin Heinecke and Elia Formisano (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2009[Jun], Vol 34[7], 1641-1648). In the original article, corrections were made to Figures 1 and 2; the revised figures are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-14110-002[/rid]). Prospective memory refers to the realization of delayed intentions. Several studies have shown that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users perform worse on measures of prospective memory as compared to nondrug users. Interpretation of these data may be limited because of polydrug use, psychosocial stressors, and increased psychopathology that have been reported in MDMA users. This study was designed to directly assess the pharmacological effect of MDMA on prospective memory and brain activity in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twelve recreational MDMA users received MDMA 75 mg and placebo and performed an objective prospective memory task during functional imaging. During prospective memory task performance subjects were engaged in a foreground task that consisted of a simple reaction time to visual stimuli (Go trials) and a prospective task of withholding a response during trials that were part of a dynamic memory set (No go trials). Behavioral data showed that a single dose of MDMA increased prospective memory failures in the No go trials, and that number of prospective memory failures was positively correlated to MDMA concentration in plasma. Functional imaging showed that MDMA decreased BOLD activation during Go trials in the thalamus (left), putamen (left), precuneus (left), and the inferior parietal lobules (bilateral), as compared to placebo. During No go trials, MDMA reduced BOLD deactivation in the inferior parietal lobules (bilateral), as compared to placebo. It is concluded that the loss of deactivation in inferior parietal lobules may account for increments in memory failures observed during MDMA intoxication.

"5586","0","Wastewater-based monitoring of illicit drug consumption in Istanbul: Preliminary results from two districts.^
Wastewater-based epidemiology is a well-established and complementary approach for monitoring illicit drug use in the general population. In this study, amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (METH), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine (COC) (from benzoylecgonine), and cannabis (from THC-COOH) consumption levels were investigated for the first time in Turkey (Istanbul). A solid-phase extraction method was applied to influent wastewater samples collected from two districts, Beyoglu and Catalca. Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis was conducted with electrospray ionization in positive mode. Calibration curves were acquired in linear form with >0.999 correlation coefficients. Limit of detection levels were measured as 0.91–151 ng/L, and limit of quantitation levels were in the range of 3 to 500 ng/L. Solid-phase extraction recovery and repeatability experiments were achieved by spiking the mix solution to different concentrations (50, 250, 750 ng/L) in 50 mL tap water and wastewater (500, 1000 ng/L) samples in six replicates. The method was optimized, and recoveries were found to be over 80% for all six substances with up to 11.9% relative standard deviation. According to the real sample results, cannabis was found to be the most abused illicit substance among the analytes. The mean consumptions of the two districts, including seven consecutive days for AMP, METH, MDMA, COC, and cannabis, were found to be 27.2, 322, 331, 385, and 1224 mg/day/1000 inhabitants, respectively. In this presented study, all targeted compounds were analyzed simultaneously with the same analytical conditions. To the best of our knowledge, this report is the first to present illicit drug consumption data from Istanbul."
"7724","1","Indoleamine Hallucinogens in Cluster Headache: Results of the Clusterbusters Medication Use Survey.^
Cluster headache is one of the most debilitating pain syndromes. A significant number of patients are refractory to conventional therapies. The Clusterbusters.org medication use survey sought to characterize the effects of both conventional and alternative medications used in cluster headache. Participants were recruited from cluster headache websites and headache clinics. The final analysis included responses from 496 participants. The survey was modeled after previously published surveys and was available online. Most responses were chosen from a list, though others were free-texted. Conventional abortive and preventative medications were identified and their efficacies agreed with those previously published. The indoleamine hallucinogens, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and lysergic acid amide, were comparable to or more efficacious than most conventional medications. These agents were also perceived to shorten/abort a cluster period and bring chronic cluster headache into remission more so than conventional medications. Furthermore, infrequent and non-hallucinogenic doses were reported to be efficacious. Findings provide additional evidence that several indoleamine hallucinogens are rated as effective in treating cluster headache. These data reinforce the need for further investigation of the effects of these and related compounds in cluster headache under experimentally controlled settings."
"8678","1","The epidemiology of mescaline use: Pattern of use, motivations for consumption, and perceived consequences, benefits, and acute and enduring subjective effects.^
Background: Mescaline is a naturally occurring psychoactive phenethylamine found in several cacti and historically used ceremonially by Indigenous and Latin American populations. Broader recognition of its possible therapeutic value in Western science began in the 1950s; however, knowledge of the safety profile of mescaline and the extent of its use remains limited. The primary aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of mescaline use among English-speaking adults. Methods: About 452 respondents completed a web-based survey designed to assess their previous experience with mescaline (subjective effects, outcome measures, and mescaline type used). Results: Most respondents reported that they had consumed mescaline infrequently (⩽once/year), for spiritual exploration or to connect with nature (74%). A small number of respondents reported drug craving/desire (9%), whereas very few reported legal (1%), or psychological problems (1%) related to its use, and none reported seeking any medical attention. Overall, respondents rated the acute mystical-type effects as “moderate,” ego-dissolution and psychological insight effects as “slight,” and challenging effects as “very slight.” Most respondents reported that they used Peyote and San Pedro in their most memorable mescaline experience. Overall, the intensity of acute mescaline effects did not differ between mescaline types. About 50% of the sample reported having a psychiatric condition (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc.), and most (>67%) reported improvements in these conditions following their most memorable experience with mescaline. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the mescaline in any form may produce a psychedelic experience that is associated with the spiritual significance and improvements in the mental health with low potential for abuse."
"4584","1","Dose-related ethanol-like effects of the NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in recently detoxified alcoholics.^
BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the dose-related ethanol-like subjective effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine hydrochloride in recently detoxified alcoholics. METHODS: Twenty male inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence and who had not consumed alcohol for 10 to 27 days prior to the study completed 3 test days that involved the intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg) or saline solution under randomized double-blind conditions. Ethanol-like subjective effects were assessed using the Sensation Scale; the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale; visual analog scales to measure ""high"" and degree of similarity to ethanol, cocaine, and marijuana; a scale assessing the number of standard alcohol drinks producing similar subjective effects; and visual analog scales measuring ethanol craving. RESULTS: Ketamine produced dose-related ethanol-like effects on each scale measuring its similarity to ethanol. Its effects were more similar to the sedative or descending limb effects of ethanol than to the stimulant or ascending limb effects. Ketamine effects also were more like ethanol than marijuana or cocaine. Ethanol-like effects were more prominent at the higher ketamine dose, a dose rated as similar to greater levels of ethanol intoxication. However, ketamine did not increase craving for ethanol. CONCLUSION: The production of ethanol-like subjective effects by ketamine supports the potential clinical importance of NMDA receptor antagonism among the mechanisms underlying the subjective effects of ethanol in humans."

Selfotel (CGS 19755), a competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, is neuroprotective in experimental models of ischemic cerebral injury. We studied the safety and tolerability of a single intravenous dose (0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg) of selfotel in neurosurgery patients. Thirty-two neurosurgical patients undergoing intracranial surgery were given ascending doses of selfotel 2 to 14 h before surgery. Serum selfotel levels were measured over a period of 24 h. Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) levels were measured 1.5 to 18 h after dosing. Frequent side effects included psychomimetic symptoms such as hallucinations, abnormal dreaming, agitation, and paranoia among 20 (66%) patients. Ataxia was seen among five (16%) and dizziness among eight (25%). Symptoms occurred 38 min to 40 h from administration and persisted 5 min to 4 days. Symptom severity worsened with increasing area under the curve measurements and doses above 1.0 mg/kg. All symptoms were reversible and easily treated with intravenous haloperidol. Modest elevations of hepatic enzymes were observed among four patients. No patient had severe adverse reactions. Maximum selfotel levels attained were 143 mumol (serum) and 4.76 mumol (CSF). Peak serum levels among six patients were within potentially neuroprotective ranges. CSF levels remained detectable up to 18 h after dosing. No obvious relationship was seen between CSF drug levels and symptoms. Selfotel in doses of 0.5 to 2.0 mg/kg can be administered safely to neurosurgical patients. Maximum serum levels attained were within the range shown to be neuroprotective in experimental studies. Side effects even at the highest levels are tolerable and reversible. Selfotel use in patients at risk for cerebral injury should be further explored."
"5071","1","Cognitive and subjective acute dose effects of intramuscular ketamine in healthy adults.^
Ketamine is a noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist. Given the purported role of the NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation, the primary purpose of the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine's overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience."
"2117","1","Ayahuasca improves emotion dysregulation in a community sample and in individuals with borderline-like traits.^
BACKGROUND: Research suggests that mindfulness-based interventions may improve mindfulness-related capacities (e.g., decentering, non-judging, and non-reacting) and emotion regulation. Previously, our group reported that ayahuasca could be a potential analogue of mindfulness practice. The main aim of the current study was to examine the effects of ayahuasca on emotional regulation and mindfulness-related capacities. Secondarily, we sought to explore the effects of ayahuasca on individuals with borderline personality disorder (BPD) traits. METHOD: This is an observational study of 45 volunteers who participated in an ayahuasca session. The volunteers completed various self-report instruments designed to measure emotional dysregulation (Difficulties in Emotion Regulation Scale (DERS)) and mindfulness traits (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ)-Short Form and Experiences Questionnaire (EQ)) prior to and 24 h after the ayahuasca session. The volunteers were divided into two subgroups based on their score on the McLean Screening Instrument for BPD (MSI-BPD). Twelve participants were grouped into the BPD-like traits subgroup while the rest of them were included in the non-BPD-like subgroup. We performed within-subjects and between-group analyses. RESULTS: Overall, the participants showed significant improvements on the FFMQ subscales observing, acting with awareness, non-judging, and non-reacting and also significantly improved on decentering (EQ scale) and on the DERS subscales emotional non-acceptance, emotional interference, and lack of control. The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice). Based on these results, we believe that ayahuasca therapy could be of value in clinical populations, such as individuals with BPD, affected by emotion dysregulation."
"6677","1","Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^
Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users."
"1510","1","Safety, tolerability, and clinical and neural effects of single-dose psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover trial.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin may help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To date, only one open-label study of psilocybin for OCD exists, necessitating further investigation with a randomized controlled design. The neural correlates of psilocybin's effects on OCD have also not been studied. OBJECTIVES: This first-of-its-kind trial aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of psilocybin in the treatment of OCD, provide preliminary evidence on the effects of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, and elucidate neural mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's effects on OCD. DESIGN: We use a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover design to examine the clinical and neural effects of either a single dose of oral psilocybin (0.25 mg/kg) or active placebo-control agent (250 mg of niacin) on OCD symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are enrolling 30 adult participants at a single site in Connecticut, USA who have failed at least one trial of standard care treatment (medication/psychotherapy) for OCD. All participants will also receive unstructured, non-directive psychological support during visits. Aside from safety, primary outcomes include OCD symptoms over the past 24 h, assessed by the Acute Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and Visual Analog Scale ratings. These are collected by blinded, independent raters at baseline and the primary endpoint of 48 h post-dosing. Total follow-up is 12 weeks post-dosing. Resting state neuroimaging data will be collected at baseline and primary endpoint. Participants randomized to placebo will be offered the chance to return for an open-label dose of 0.25 mg/kg. ETHICS STATEMENT: All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The trial (protocol v. 5.2) was approved by the institutional review board (HIC #2000020355) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03356483). DISCUSSION: This study may represent an advance in our ability to treat refractory OCD, and pave the way for future studies of neurobiological mechanisms of OCD that may respond to psilocybin."
"5563","1","Event-related potentials (ERPs) in ecstasy (MDMA) users during a visual oddball task.^
Ecstasy is the common name for a drug mainly containing a substance identified as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). It has become popular with participants in ""raves"", because it enhances energy, endurance and sexual arousal, together with the widespread belief that MDMA is a safe drug [Byard, R.W., Gilbert, J., James, R., Lokan, R.J., 1998. Amphetamine derivative fatalities in South Australia. Is ""ecstasy"" the culprit? Am. J. Forensic Med. Pathol. 19, 261-265]. However, it is suggested that this drug causes a neurotoxicity to the serotonergic system that could lead to permanent physical and cognitive problems. In order to investigate this issue, and during an ERP recording with 32 channels, we used a visual oddball design, in which subjects (14 MDMA abusers and 14 paired normal controls) saw frequent stimuli (neutral faces) while they had to detect as quickly as possible rare stimuli with happy or fearful expression. At a behavioral level, MDMA users imply longer latencies than normal controls to detect rare stimuli. At the neurophysiological level, ERP data suggest as main result that the N200 component, which is involved in attention orienting associated to the detection of stimulus novelty (e.g. [Campanella, S., Gaspard, C., Debatisse, D., Bruyer, R., Crommelinck, M., Guérit, J.M., 2002. Discrimination of emotional facial expression in a visual oddball task: an ERP study. Biol. Psychol. 59, 171-186]), shows shorter latencies for fearful rare stimuli (as compared to happy ones), but only for normal controls. This absence of delay was interpreted as an attentional deficit due to MDMA consumption. © 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"5001","1","Baseline cognitive function predicts full remission of suicidal symptoms among patients with treatment-resistant depression and strong suicidal ideation after low-dose ketamine infusion.^
BACKGROUND: Whether pretreatment working memory and response inhibition function are associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and strong suicidal ideation is unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 65 patients with TRD, comprising 33 who received a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 32 who received a placebo infusion. The participants performed working memory and go/no-go tasks prior to infusion. We assessed suicidal symptoms at baseline and on postinfusion Days 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: The full remission of suicidal symptoms persisted for 3 days after a single ketamine infusion and the ketamine-related antisuicidal effect persisted for 1 week. Lower cognitive impairment at baseline (indicated by a higher rate of correct responses on a working memory task) was associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine in patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation but low cognitive impairment may benefit the most from the antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine."
"4956","1","Alterations of consciousness and mystical-type experiences after acute LSD in humans.^
RATIONALE: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used recreationally and in clinical research. Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects. However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are lacking. METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of 100 and 200 μg LSD in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200 μg. RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200 μg LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 200 μg compared with 100 μg. Plasma levels of LSD were not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution at 100 μg. CONCLUSIONS: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater or different alterations of consciousness at 200 μg (i.e., a dose that is currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100 μg (i.e., a dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD, whereas more robustly induced effects of LSD may not result in such associations."
"7913","1","Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitor and cytochrome P450 2D6 status on 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine metabolism and pharmacokinetics.^
5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a natural psychoactive indolealkylamine drug that has been used for recreational purpose. Our previous study revealed that polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce active metabolite bufotenine, while 5-MeO-DMT is mainly inactivated through deamination pathway mediated by monoamine oxidase (MAO). This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the impact of CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype status and MAO inhibitor (MAOI) on 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Enzyme kinetic studies using recombinant CYP2D6 allelic isozymes showed that CYP2D6.2 and CYP2D6.10 exhibited 2.6- and 40-fold lower catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km), respectively, in producing bufotenine from 5-MeO-DMT, compared with wild-type CYP2D6.1. When co-incubated with MAOI pargyline, 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation in 10 human liver microsomes showed significantly strong correlation with bufuralol 1′-hydroxylase activities (R2=0.98; P<0.0001) and CYP2D6 contents (R2=0.77; P=0.0007), whereas no appreciable correlations with enzymatic activities of other P450 enzymes. Furthermore, concurrent MAOI harmaline sharply reduced 5-MeO-DMT depletion and increased bufotenine formation in human CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer hepatocytes. In vivo studies in wild-type and CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mouse models showed that Tg-CYP2D6 mice receiving the same dose of 5-MeO-DMT (20mg/kg, i.p.) had 60% higher systemic exposure to metabolite bufotenine. In addition, pretreatment of harmaline (5mg/kg, i.p.) led to 3.6- and 4.4-fold higher systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2mg/kg, i.p.), and 9.9- and 6.1-fold higher systemic exposure to bufotenine in Tg-CYP2D6 and wild-type mice, respectively. These findings indicate that MAOI largely affects 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics, as well as bufotenine formation that is mediated by CYP2D6. © 2010 Elsevier Inc."
"1251","1","Long-Term Efficacy of Intranasal Esketamine in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: A Systematic Review.^
Esketamine (ESK) has been approved as a rapid-acting intranasal treatment for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Although existing studies have investigated the efficacy of ESK in the 4-week induction phase, our knowledge about long-term ESK efficacy remains poor. The aim of this systematic review was to summarize the available data on long-term ESK efficacy for TRD. A systematic search was performed including articles in English, up to 31 March 2021. The search found 7 relevant studies, involving 1024 adult TRD patients. Continuing treatment with ESK after the 4-week induction phase may be associated with stable efficacy in relapse prevention among TRD patients. Conversely, the long-term antidepressant effectiveness upon discontinuation of ESK might be limited, although data from three studies had a moderate to high risk of bias. Overall, the results on the effectiveness of this compound in the long term are mixed. According to our findings, ESK treatment should be continued following the induction phase to reach a stable efficacy in relapse prevention, while the long-term antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ESK after discontinuation are inconsistent. Currently, the level of proof of ESK efficacy in long-term TRD treatment remains low and more RCTs with larger sample sizes and active comparators are needed."

Background: THC and CBD are the principal phyto-cannabinoids in the cannabis plant. The differential and possibly antagonistic effects of these compounds on specific brain and behavioral responses, and the mechanisms underlying their effects have generated extensive interest in pre-clinical and clinical neuroscience investigations. Methods: In this double-blind randomized placebo-controlled counterbalanced Human Laboratory Study, we examined the effects of three different dose ratios of CBD:THC (1:1, 2:1, and 3:1) on ""neural noise,"" an electrophysiological biomarker of psychosis known to be sensitive to cannabinoids as well as subjective and psychotomimetic effects. Healthy volunteers (n=28, 12 women) with at least one prior exposure to cannabis participated in the study. Outcomes: The lowest CBD (2.5 mg):THC (0.035 mg/kg) ratio (1:1) resulted in maximal attenuation of both THC-induced psychotomimetic effects (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale [PANSS] positive: Anova Type Statistic [ATS]=7.83, p(corrected)=0.015) and neural noise (ATS=8.83, p(corrected)=0.009). Further addition of CBD did not reduce the subjective experience of THC-induced ""high"" (p>0.05 for all CBD doses). Interpretation: These novel results demonstrate that CBD attenuates specific THC-induced subjective and objective effects relevant to psychosis in a dose/ratio-dependent manner. Given the increasing global trend of cannabis liberalization and application for medical indications, these results assume considerable significance given the potential dose-related interactions of these key phyto-cannabinoids. Trial registration: The trial was registered in clinicaltrials.gov ID: NCT01180374."
"8285","0","Investigating the 'bath salt' panic: the rarity of synthetic cathinone use among students in the United States.^
INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Until recently, synthetic cathinones marketed as 'bath salts' were legally sold at convenience stores and online in the USA. Media reports initiated concerns of a growing 'bath salt' epidemic. Despite media attention and the recent legal action banning synthetic cathinones, little is known about its prevalence or users. DESIGN AND METHODS: A self-report survey was administered to 2349 students in 40 randomly selected courses at a large university in the Southeastern United States. The resulting sample was 51.6% female, 68.9% white, 24.4% black, 2.8% Hispanic and 4.0% other races, with a mean age of 20.06 years and median family income of $75 000-99 999. RESULTS: Only 25 (1.07%) of the students reported using synthetic cathinones at least once. Synthetic cathinone use was found to be more common among men (1.68% vs. 0.50% of women, P = 0.005), Hispanics (4.7%) and Native Americans (4.3% vs. 0.89% of whites and 0.72% of blacks, P = 0.002), and student athletes (4.0% vs. 0.90% of non-athletes, P = 0.001), but in each of these groups, synthetic cathinones were used more rarely than marijuana (58.14%, P < 0.001), cocaine (9.08%, P < 0.001), Salvia divinorum (7.89%, P < 0.001), synthetic cannabinoids (14.28%, P < 0.001), methamphetamines (1.92%, P = 0.002), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) (12.54%, P < 0.001) and several other drugs and pharmaceuticals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 'Bath salts' have received a great deal of media attention in the USA, yet the prevalence of synthetic cathinone use among our sample was extremely rare. We suggest that the media attention focusing on synthetic cathinone use as a growing epidemic may be largely misplaced."
"3055","0","Prospective audit of short-term concurrent ketamine, opioid and anti-inflammatory ('triple-agent') therapy for episodes of acute on chronic pain.^
AIM: This prospective audit was undertaken in order to document the analgesic response and adverse effects of concurrent short-term ('burst') triple-agent analgesic (ketamine, an opioid and an anti-inflammatory agent--either steroidal or non-steroidal) administration, for episodes of acute on chronic pain. The clinical hypothesis in this study is that better pain control may be obtained by simultaneous multiple target receptor blockade. METHOD: The response of 18 patients is reported. The pain and analgesic requirement data for the 24 h before starting triple-agent therapy were compared with the last 24 h on the triple-agent therapy. Patients were then classified as responders or non-responders. RESULTS: According to stringent clinical criteria, 12 out of the 18 patients were classified as responders. The response rate was highest for somatic pain (7/9) and appeared to decrease with duration of prior uncontrolled pain. Only four out of the 18 patients reported adverse effects and all of these were minor. CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that this 'burst' triple-agent approach is safe and effective in an inpatient palliative care population during episodes of poorly controlled acute on chronic pain, and warrants further investigation to ascertain whether it gives superior results compared to the 'gold-standard' WHO ladder approach."

The MDMA (3,4-méthylènedioxyméthamphétamine), mainly available as modernly designed and colorful ecstasy pills, is the third most consumed recreational drug in Europe, following cannabis and cocaine. For some years, the content of ecstasy tablets has increased, with a purity level going from 21 % in 2010 to 72 % in 2017. This tendency induces a higher toxicity risk for the consumer. In Paris alone, 10 deaths attributable to the MDMA were reported by the narcotics brigade in the course of 2019. We report here one of those cases: a 21-year-old student died following the consumption of an ecstasy dose most likely overdosed. The MDMA plasmatic concentration measured for this patient (3 945 ng/mL) was ten fold higher to those usually found after the consumption of a single dose of ecstasy. Analysis of our laboratory's data from 2016 to 2019 describes a median concentration of 256 ng/mL for 83 intoxicated patients. Only 5 cases presented a concentration over 2 000 ng/mL, with a maximum concentration observed at 17 331 ng/mL. Three deaths probably due to MDMA were recorded."
"5032","1","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

Psychological changes were assessed by psychometric rating scales. MDMA produced distributed changes in regional blood flow including increases in ventromedial frontal and occipital cortex, inferior temporal lobe and cerebellum; and decreases in the motor and somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe including left amygdala, cingulate cortex, insula and thalamus. Concomitant with these changes, subjects experienced heightened mood, increased extroversion, slight derealization and mild perceptual alterations. MDMA also produced increases in blood pressure and several side effects such as jaw clenching, lack of appetite and difficulty concentrating. These results indicate that a distributed cluster of brain areas underlie the various effects of MDMA in humans."
"938","0","How much alcohol is in ketamine's antidepressant action?.^
Ketamine is approved to start and maintain anaesthesia or analgesia. Ketamine is also known to be neurotoxic and an old drug of abuse. Numerous studies have proven a rapid and strong antidepressant response (AR) following parenteral sub-anaesthetic ketamine doses when applied the first time to patients with treatment resistant unipolar or bipolar major depression. This rapid and robust AR is encouraging, though short-lived (usually up to seven days). There is growing evidence that repeated und escalating ketamine administrations exert longer-lasting AR than single infusions. Yet, the clinical studies and follow-ups are still too short-lasting to get useful information about ketamine's liability to be addictive and neurotoxic after repeated or even prolonged administrations to severely depressed patients. In this vein, it could be worth to have a look at a couple of pharmacological features that ketamine shares with alcohol being presented here. In essence, there are striking similarities between ketamine and alcohol particularly in terms of modulating glutamatergic and dopaminergic signaling in cortico-limbic brain areas involved in learning, reward and mood regulation, thereby, probably mediating both, AR as well as the development of addiction. Moreover, moderate amounts of both drugs have comparable immunoinhibitory effects hypothesized to be involved in AR, too."
"3901","0","Basic metabolic and vascular effects of ketamine and its interaction with fentanyl.^
Ketamine is a short-acting general anesthetic with hallucinogenic, analgesic, and amnestic properties. In addition to its anesthetic use, ketamine is commonly abused in rave settings. While safe when used by medical professionals, uncontrolled recreational use of ketamine is dangerous, especially when mixed with other sedative drugs, including alcohol, benzodiazepines, and opioid drugs. Since synergistic antinociceptive interactions between opioids and ketamine were demonstrated in both preclinical and clinical studies, such an interaction could exist for the hypoxic effects of opioid drugs. Here, we focused on the basic physiological effects of ketamine as a recreational drug and its possible interactions with fentanyl-a highly potent opioid that induces strong respiratory depression and robust brain hypoxia. By using multi-site thermorecording in freely-moving rats, we showed that intravenous ketamine at a range of human relevant doses (3, 9, 27 mg/kg) dose-dependently increases locomotor activity and brain temperature, as assessed in the nucleus accumbens (NAc). By determining temperature differentials between the brain, temporal muscle, and skin, we showed that the brain hyperthermic effect of ketamine results from increased intracerebral heat production, an index of metabolic neural activation, and decreased heat loss due to peripheral vasoconstriction. By using oxygen sensors coupled with high-speed amperometry we showed that ketamine at the same doses increases NAc oxygen levels. Finally, co-administration of ketamine with intravenous fentanyl results in modest enhancement of fentanyl-induced brain hypoxia also enhancing the post-hypoxic oxygen increase. Therefore, in contrast to fentanyl, ketamine increases brain oxygenation but potentiates brain hypoxia induced by fentanyl."

Examined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The present study was undertaken to examine effects of self-administered MDMA on novel object exploration (NOR) memory. Self-administration was conducted during daily 2 h tests that continued until a total of 165 mg/kg was self-administered (range = 13-41 days for individual rats). Control rats were placed in the self-administration boxes during daily sessions but did not receive any drug. One or 10 weeks following the last self-administration session, memory was assessed using a standard NOR task. When exploration time was used as the dependent measure for the control rats, there was no consistent pattern of change as a function of inter-trial interval (ITI) and exploration times failed to reveal decay in the function relating exploration to ITI. When number of approaches was examined as a function of ITI, however, there was a preference for the novel object following the short ITIs (1-15 min) and the function relating preference to ITI decayed with longer ITIs. When tested 7 days following the last self-administration session, rats that self-administered MDMA failed to demonstrate NOR even following the shortest ITI of 1 min. The data support the idea that MDMA self-administration produces cognitive deficits and are consistent with the idea that attentional processes become disrupted. There was, however, recovery of NOR memory when rats were tested following an extended drug-free period of 70 days. Thus, the deficits are transient and recovery was apparent."

Methods: Patients (N = 405; age M = 38; 69% White; 60% female) presenting for intake in a psychiatry outpatient clinic completed a computerized assessment of psychiatric problems, drinking, and drug use. Substance use and psychiatric symptom patterns among the sample were identified using latent class analysis. Results: A 4-class model fit the data best: Class (1) Moderate symptoms/wide-range users (22.0%) had moderate depression and panic; tobacco, cocaine, hallucinogen, and ecstasy use; and high cannabis use. Class (2) Moderate depression/panic (37.8%) had moderate depression and panic. Class (3) Depression/anxiety, tobacco, and cannabis users (28.0%) had high depression, obsessions, and panic, and moderate pain severity, social phobia, compulsions, trauma, tobacco, and cannabis use. Class (4) Severe/wide range symptoms/users (12.0%) had high panic, depression, social phobia, obsessions, drug use, and moderate pain. Gender, ethnicity, and health status varied by class. Conclusions: Findings highlight the preponderance of substance use (particularly cannabis) and its relationship to psychiatric symptom severity, pain, and health status among those presenting for mental health treatment."
"2477","1","The effects of esketamine and treatment expectation in acute major depressive disorder (Expect): study protocol for a pharmacological fMRI study using a balanced placebo design.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent (8-15%), severely disabling disorder and is associated with enormous socioeconomic impact. Antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD has proven effective in RCTs; however, placebo response is also substantial. Given the potential benefits of modulating the placebo response in patient care and pharmacological research, understanding the mechanisms underlying placebo response is of high clinical relevance. The placebo response is mediated by treatment expectation, i.e. an individual's belief about whether and how much they will improve as a consequence of their treatment. The mechanisms and moderators of treatment expectation effects in MDD are poorly understood. Initial brain imaging studies on placebo responses in MDD point towards the relevance of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In this project, we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of treatment expectation associated with the fast-acting antidepressant esketamine in patients with MDD. Esketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist inducing antidepressant effects within hours. METHODS: We will employ a fully balanced placebo design with the factors ""treatment"" (i.v. esketamine / placebo) and verbally induced ""expectation"" (high / low) combined with fMRI (resting state, emotion and reward processing paradigms) to investigate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of expectation, and how these interact with the pharmacological effects of esketamine. DISCUSSION: The insights gained by this project promise fundamental implications for clinical treatment and future drug trials. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying expectation effects on antidepressant treatment may inform (1) strategies to modulate these effects and thus improve assay sensitivity in RCTs and (2) novel treatment regiments aiming to maximize the synergistic effects of expectation and pharmacological treatment in the clinical care of patients with MDD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been prospectively registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT-No.: 2020-000784-23 (November 17, 2020)."

Reports an error in 'Ketamine effects on CNS responses assessed with MEG/EEG in a passive auditory sensory-gating paradigm: An attempt for modelling some symptoms of psychosis in man' by Peter H. Boeijinga, L. Soufflet, F. Santoro and R. Luthringer (Journal of Psychopharmacology, 2007[May], Vol 21[3], 321-337). The publishers regret that the email address of the corresponding author was published incorrectly. The correct email address is: Peter.Boeijinga@forenap.com. In the article, the legend for Table 1 was not included and Figure 2a was incorrect. The correct table and figure are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-11032-010[/rid]). Disturbances in integrative function have been consistently described in psychotic disorder; for instance, prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (startle-PPI) which is a marker of sensory gating, is deficient in persons with schizophrenia. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produces in control subjects a spectrum of neurobehavioral symptoms like encountered in schizophrenia, and disrupts startle-PPI in animals. In the present study, we investigated in 12 healthy subjects whether ketamine would reduce sensory-gating in auditory responses at doses which produce psychotic symptoms. In a double-blind, crossover design loading doses of 0.024, 0.081 and 0.27 mg/kg or saline were employed, followed by maintenance infusion for 120 min. A passive paradigm has been developed which consisted in tone bursts, preceded or not by a (near-threshold) click at intervals of 100 ms or 500 ms. Brain electromagnetic activity imaging of the responses to sound stimuli has been carried out by way of a 148-channel magnetoencephalography-system. Actual evoked response amplitudes and underlying equivalent current dipole strengths have been compared to multielectrode evoked potentials from the scalp. A click stimulus is capable to inhibit test responses under placebo at the 100ms interval. During maintenance infusion of ketamine at steady-state (for >30 min) after 0.27 mg/kg, no such amplitude changes were observed anymore (p<0.05) and under these circumstances significant increases in Brief Psychiatric Rating scale and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores were evidenced (p<0.001). Intermediate effects have been observed when the dose was lowered to 0.081 mg/kg. The present results have shown that ketamine may induce a psychotic-like clinical state associated with gating deficits in healthy subjects.

INTERVENTION: Participating secondary schools will be randomly allocated to one of two groups. One group will serve as the control group and receive their usual drug education in school and the other group with receive the Climate Schools intervention: Climate Schools Intervention The Climate Schools: Ecstasy & Emerging Drugs Module is an online school‐based prevention program designed to prevent the use of ecstasy and New and Emerging Drugs (NEDs) and reduce related harms. The intervention consists of four 40‐minute lessons delivered as part of the Year 10 PDHPE syllabus. The lessons are intended to be delivered once weekly over a four week period. The first part of each lesson is completed individually over the internet where students view a 15‐20 minute cartoon storyline. The second part of each lesson consists of online and group activities designed to reinforce the information in the cartoons and foster interactive communication between students. Teachers are provided with a manual containing the activities, implementation guidelines, links to the education syllabus and summaries for each lesson. To monitor adherence to the intervention, teachers are required to complete an online Fidelity Logbook. The logbooks ask teachers to indicate which lessons and activities they completed with their class and to write down any adaptions they made to the program. To ensure completion of the online component of the intervention, students are required to view the cartoon lesson in full before being granted access the following lesson. CONDITION: Prevention of substance use‐related harms Substance use prevention PRIMARY OUTCOME: Intentions to use any NPS. Students rated how likely they were to use any type of NPS during the next 6 months and responses were coded ‘very unlikely, unlikely, unsure = 0’ or ‘likely, very likely = 1’. Intentions to use ecstasy. Students rated how likely they were to use ecstasy during the next 6 months and responses were coded ‘very unlikely, unlikely, unsure = 0’ or ‘likely, very likely = 1’. INCLUSION CRITERIA: Year 10 students at participating Sydney schools SECONDARY OUTCOME: Intentions to use synthetic cannabis. Students were asked to rate how likely they are to use synthetic cannabis in the ‘next six months’ and ‘at any time in the future’. Each item required students to rate their intention on a five‐point Likert scale labelled ‘very likely’ to ‘very unlikely’. responses were coded ‘very unlikely, unlikely, unsure = 0’ or ‘likely, very likely = 1’. Intentions to use synthetic stimulants ('bath salts'). Students were asked to rate how likely they are to use synthetic stimulants in the ‘next six months’ and ‘at any time in the future’. Each item required students to rate their intention on a five‐point Likert scale labelled ‘very likely’ to ‘very unlikely’. responses were coded ‘very unlikely, unlikely, unsure = 0’ or ‘likely, very likely = 1’. Knowledge about NPS. Knowledge about NPS was assessed using five items measuring students’ knowledge about NPS themselves, the associated harms and prevalence of use. For each statement, students were required to answer ‘True’, ‘False’ or ‘Don’t Know. Scores were summed to produce a total knowledge score. Knowledge about ecstasy. Ecstasy knowledge was assessed using a 15‐item scale developed to reflect the intended content of the Climate Schools intervention. Items assessed knowledge about the prevalence of use, risks and harm‐minimization information. For each statements, students were required to answer ‘True’, ‘False’ or ‘Don’t Know. Scores were summed to produce a total knowledge score. Life‐time ecstasy use was assessed via a single item (‘Have you ever used ecstasy?; yes/no), adapted from the 2010 Australian National Drug Strategy Household Survey. Three similar items were used to assess lifetime use of ‘any NPS’, ‘synthetic cannabis (marijuana), e.g. Spice, Kronic, K2’ and ‘synthetic stimulants (‘bath salts’). The distinc ion between synthetic cannabis and synthetic stimulants (cathinones) is consistent with the Monitoring the Future survey from the United States."
"6569","1","Shank3 as a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine and its neural correlates in bipolar depression.^
BACKGROUND: Shank3, a post-synaptic density protein involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor tethering and dendritic spine rearrangement, is implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that elevated baseline plasma Shank3 levels might predict antidepressant response to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with bipolar depression received a double-blind, randomized, subanesthetic dose (.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Of the patients for whom Shank3 levels were collected, 15 completed baseline 3-Tesla MRI and 17 completed post-ketamine [(18)F]-FDG PET. RESULTS: Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 (r=-.39, p=.047), 2 (r=-.45, p=.02), and 3 (r=-.42, p=.03) and were associated with larger average (r=.58, p=.02) and right amygdala volume (r=.65, p=.009). Greater baseline Shank3 also predicted increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus (r=.51, p=.04) and amygdala (r=.58, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size, inability to assess the source of peripheral Shank3, and the lack of a placebo group for baseline Shank3 levels and comparative structural/functional neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS: Shank3 is a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine that correlates with baseline amygdala volume and increased glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus."
"3004","0","Naturalistic Psychedelic Use: A World Apart from Clinical Care.^
Interest in and availability of psychedelics for therapeutic purposes has increased in recent decades. In a large, anonymous, online survey, we investigated patterns of communication with healthcare providers and awareness and utilization of substance testing kits or services among people using psychedelics naturalistically. The sample population included attendees of a psychedelic activism event and users of psychedelic social media forums. Among 1,435 participants, 72.5% never discussed psychedelic use with their primary care provider (PCP). Only 4.4% reported using psychedelics with a therapist and 3% in clinical settings, although 77.8% were very or extremely likely to take psychedelics with a therapist if one were legally available. While 62.6% of participants were aware of substance testing services, 42.6% of these indicated never using them. Regression analyses identified several variables associated with disclosure to PCP and utilization of substance testing services including age, gender, frequency and number of psychedelics used, and likelihood of consuming psychedelics under the guidance of a therapist if one were legally available. Further research is necessary to investigate these findings among other groups. Our findings suggest that relevant training and education for healthcare providers is needed, along with more visible options for substance identity testing."
"2162","1","Effect of Esketamine Nasal Spray on Olfactory Function and Nasal Tolerability in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results from Four Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Studies.^
BACKGROUND: Intranasal drug delivery offers a non-invasive and convenient dosing option for patients and physicians, especially for conditions requiring chronic/repeated-treatment administration. However, in some cases such delivery may be harmful to nasal and olfactory epithelia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of long-term intermittent treatment with esketamine nasal spray, taken in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (AD), on olfactory function and nasal tolerability in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: A total of 1142 patients with TRD participated from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III studies: three short-term studies (two in patients aged 18-64 years, one in patients ≥65 years), and one long-term maintenance study of esketamine nasal spray + AD versus placebo nasal spray + AD. Across the four studies, assessments were performed at 208 sites in 21 countries. Olfactory function was measured using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT(®)) and the single-staircase Snap & Sniff(®) Odor Detection Threshold Test (S&S-T). Nasal tolerability, including nasal examinations and a quantitative, self-administered nasal symptom questionnaire (NSQ), was also assessed. Data were analyzed using analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Of 1142 participants, 734 were women (64.3%). The mean age of all participants ranged from 45.7 to 70.0 years across the studies. Overall, 855 patients received esketamine nasal spray + AD and 432 received placebo nasal spray + AD. Objective evaluation of nasal function showed no evidence of an adverse impact following esketamine administration. Based on the UPSIT(®) and S&S-T results, intranasal administration of esketamine had no effect on the odor identification or threshold test scores compared with placebo nasal spray + oral AD. Similarly, repeated administration with esketamine nasal spray had no meaningful impact on assessments of nasal function. No dose-response relationship was observed between esketamine doses and the olfactory test scores. Esketamine nasal spray was well tolerated, as indicated by responses on the NSQ and negative nasal examination findings. CONCLUSION: Findings from this analysis indicate that there was no evidence of adverse effect on either olfactory or nasal health measures with repeated intermittent administration of esketamine nasal spray at any dose over the course of short-term (4 weeks) or long-term (16-100 weeks) studies.

"8335","1","Psilocybin with psychological support improves emotional face recognition in treatment-resistant depression.^
RATIONALE: Depressed patients robustly exhibit affective biases in emotional processing which are altered by SSRIs and predict clinical outcome. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients' emotional processing biases. METHODS: Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin. RESULTS: We found evidence for a group × time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p < .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin with psychological support appears to improve processing of emotional faces in treatment-resistant depression, and this correlates with reduced anhedonia. Placebo-controlled studies are warranted to follow up these preliminary findings."

Numerous clinical trials have reported that intravenous (IV) ketamine demonstrates rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These studies, however, have not characterized whether these antidepressant effects translate to improvements in workplace productivity and functionality. Adults with TRD received repeated doses of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic (n = 171). We evaluated patient outcomes at two timepoints of interest: (1) acute-phase (i.e., following 4-6 infusions, 17.6 ± 12.6 days from baseline) and (2) maintenance-phase (i.e., following 7-10 infusions, 153.9 ± 63.4 days from baseline). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to maintenance-phase scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) workplace/school item as well as days underproductive (i.e., presenteeism) and days lost (i.e., absenteeism). Secondary measures included the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)). There was a significant reduction in workplace/school disability, and significantly reduced symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism. At the acute-phase outcome, this translated to 2 more days of productivity and 1.5 less days absent from work. Additionally, IV ketamine exhibited a sustained antidepressant effect across the ten infusions. IV ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in workplace/school disability and demonstrated improvements in symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism."
"8042","1","Racemic ketamine treatment attenuates anterior cingulate cortex GABA deficits among remitters in treatment-resistant depression: A pilot study.^
The article presents a study on the racemic ketamine treatment attenuates anterior cingulate cortex GABA deficits among remitters in treatment-resistant depression. This was an open-label feasibility trial that enrolled 12 adults (18–65 years) with treatment-resistant moderately-severe/severe (PHQ-9 score ≥ 15) MDD (defined as failure to respond to two adequate trials of antidepressive treatments, including pharmacotherapy with antidepressants, ECT, or TMS) and who received a single IV ketamine infusion (0.5 mg/kg, infused over 40 min). This preliminary pilot study suggests a reduction of ACC GABA deficit may be a potential mechanism of action of ketamine. GABA is a major inhibitory neurotransmitter and extensive alteration of cortical GABAergic inhibitory circuit has been shown with chronic stress and depression leading to neuronal excitability. Thus, reducing GABA deficits could be a potential pathway to reduce neuronal excitability. Supporting this hypothesis would be prior studies which have indicated lower GABA levels in ACC in MDD but not remitted MDD. These data would suggest that ketamine actively engages central ACC GABA, and, if replicated, may represent a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment response. This is consistent with preclinical evidence highlighting countering GABAergic deficits with antidepressant therapies. In conclusion, this pilot study suggests ketamine reduces GABA deficits among TRD patients who remitted with ketamine infusion. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"3088","0","Differential effects of cocaine and MDMA self-administration on cortical serotonin transporter availability in monkeys.^
Cocaine self-administration alters brain dopaminergic and serotonergic function primarily in mesolimbic and prefrontal brain regions whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) self-administration predominately alters brain serotonergic function in a more widespread distribution across cortical regions. We previously reported that, compared to drug-naive rhesus monkeys, self-administration of cocaine but not MDMA was associated with increased serotonin transporter (SERT) availability in two mesolimbic regions, the caudate nucleus and putamen, as measured by positron emission tomography (PET) using the SERT-specific ligand [C-11]-3-amino-4(2-dimethylamino-methyl-phenylsulfanyl)-benzonitrile ([C-11]DASB). The goal of the present study was to extend this comparison between cocaine and MDMA self-administration to SERT availability in cortical regions, which have been shown previously to be affected in human drug abusers and are associated with executive function. PET studies using [C-11]DASB were conducted in adult male rhesus monkeys with a history of cocaine (mean intake = 742.6 mg/kg) or MDMA (mean intake = 121.0 mg/kg) self-administration, and drug-naive controls (n = 4/group). Regions of interest were drawn for several cortical (prefrontal, temporal, parietal, occipital and midcingulate) and subcortical (thalamus, amygdala and hippocampus) areas. Cortical SERT availability was significantly higher in monkeys with a cocaine self-administration history compared to controls whereas MDMA self-administration resulted in lower levels of SERT availability. These data extend our previous findings indicating that cocaine and MDMA self-administration differentially alter SERT availability in subcortical and cortical regions, which may have implications for development of treatment drugs.

"6168","1","Effects of MDMA-like Substances in Healthy Subjects.^
3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used as recreational substance (Ecstasy), research tool to stimulate serotonin (5‐HT) and oxytocin release and study associated mood states, and as a potential therapeutic substance to enhance psychotherapy for post‐traumatic stress disorder. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative which, unlike prototypical amphetamines, predominantly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission via release of 5‐HT through the SERT and it less potently also releases dopamine and norepinephrine through the DA transporter and NE transporter, respectively. Furthermore, MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which may contribute to its effects to increase trust, prosociality, and enhance empathy. MDMA is therefore referred to as an ""entactogen"" or ""empathogen"". MDMA is currently the only empathogen investigated in substance‐assisted psychotherapy but other substances including the MDMA‐metabolite 3,4‐methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) have been used in the past or may be used in the future. Aim 1: MDA may exert greater perceptual psychedelic‐like effects due to a more potent binding to the serotonin 5‐HT2A receptor, and it may also act longer than MDMA partly due to a longer plasma half‐life. However, effects of MDMA and MDA have never been compared directly in the same study in humans and there is only one modern study that characterized MDA in humans. Therefore, the present study aims to describe and directly compare for the first time the effects of MDMA and MDA in the same healthy volunteers using modern and sensitive psychological and psychometric tests. Aim 2: Additionally, although amphetamines including MDMA and MDA induce mainly positive subjective effects they may also produce negative subjective drug effects including anxiety in particular at the onset of the subjective response and the rapid onset of euphoria may increase abuse liability. Additionally, blood pressure may increase rapidly at drug onset. A possible solution to mitigate anxiety, abuse‐related rapid euphoria increases and/or rapid blood pressure changes at onset consist of slowing the onset of the drug effect by using a slow‐release formulation of MDMA/MDA. Alternatively, amphetamines can be linked to the endogenous amino acid lysine forming inactive lysine‐amphetamine which then liberates the active amphetamine slowly in the circulation via plasma peptidases. This approach has been implemented with the medication Lisdexamfetamine, which combines lysine with d‐amphetamine. In the present study, the investigators will similarly characterize the effects of lysine‐MDMA and lysine‐MDA to test for attenuated effects across both substances in comparison with MDMA/MDA. Using a two‐factorial study design with four active substance conditions (MDMA vs. MDA and lysine‐MDMA vs. lysine‐MDA) the investigators will be able to test differences between MDMA and MDA (with and without lysine) as well as between lysinated a non‐lysinated substance (regardless of active substance) in the same study and with high statistical power and within one study addressing two aims."

Depression is a common mental disorder that occurs all over the world with treatment resistance commonly seen in clinical practice. Ketamine exhibits an antidepressant that is more often used in the case of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in MDD and BP. Research emphasizes that a healthy diet and the nutrients it contains can lower the risk of developing depression and form a strategy that supports conventional treatment. The aim of the study was to evaluate the patients' diet and to analyze the effect of ketamine on food intake among patients with TRD. The study involved 15 patients suffering from treatment-resistant depression and 15 healthy volunteers. The data required for the analysis were collected using the food frequency questionnaire (FFQ) and 4-day food diaries. The study group was statistically significantly less likely to consume milk and plain milk beverages, plain white cheese, wholemeal bread, various vegetables, wine, and drinks. Our results show several disorders in the eating habits of patients with treatment-resistant depression. After the administration of ketamine, the patients consumed significantly less protein, fats, monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA) and polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA), fiber, tryptophan, vitamins, and minerals compared to the control group. There is a lack of research describing the effects of ketamine on nutrition. In order to confirm the results of the study, more participants are required, and the assessment of food diaries filled in at the patient's home with a longer interval after the last dose of ketamine as well."

Cognitive deficits in schizophrenia, which include impairments in working memory and attention, represent some of the most disabling symptoms of this complex psychiatric condition, and lack effective treatments. NMDA receptor (NMDAr) hypofunction is a strong candidate mechanism underlying schizophrenia pathophysiology, and has been modeled preclinically using acute administration of NMDAr antagonists to rodents to investigate biological mechanisms underpinning cognitive dysfunction. However. whether and how NMDAr hypofunction specifically influences all affected cognitive domains is unclear. Here we studied the effects of the NMDAr antagonist MK-801 (dizocilpine) on tasks of attention and working memory in rats using automated touchscreen chambers. Adult male Wistar rats were trained to perform the trial-unique nonmatching to location (TUNL) task of spatial working memory, or the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5CSRTT) of attention. Once trained, rats received injection of vehicle (saline) or low-dose MK-801 (0.06 mg/kg sc) 10 min prior to commencing test sessions. MK-801 significantly impaired working memory, as evidenced by reduced performance accuracy on the TUNL task (p < .0001). compared with vehicle. However, we found no significant effects on attentional processing or perseveration on the 5CSRTT. Additional measures indicated that MK-801 impaired behavioral flexibility in the TUNL task, and decreased response inhibition in both tasks. Using the automated touchscreen system to measure different cognitive functions under the same testing environment, we demonstrate that spatial working memory, response inhibition, and behavioral flexibility are more vulnerable to NMDAr hypofunction than attentional processing. This may have implications for the NMDAr hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia."

By use of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, the Single-Dose Questionnaire, and selected physiologic measures (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, oral temperature, and pupil diameter), the abuse liability of buspirone (10, 20, and 40 mg) was compared with that of diazepam (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in 19 subjects who were hospitalized for the treatment of alcohol dependency. Each treatment was given as a single dose at intervals of at least three days according to a double-blind, six-period, crossover Latin square design. Neither buspirone nor diazepam had any effect on blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, or body temperature. A small, transient pupillary constriction was evident in the 20- and 40-mg buspirone groups, but it dissipated within two hours after dosing. Both buspirone and diazepam had only a small stimulating effect on appetite. On the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group and Sedation subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the 40-mg dose of buspirone yielded effects suggestive of a mild sedative-type drug. Only the 20-mg dose produced a significant effect on the Euphoria scale. Diazepam appeared to be more active as a sedative-hypnotic type of drug, by virtue of its effects on both the Amphetamine and Euphoria subscales and its greater effects on the Morphine-Benzedrine Group, Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, and Sedation subscales, suggesting euphoria. Not only does the lack of effect of buspirone on the Amphetamine and Morphine-Benzedrine Group subscales indicate lack of a euphorigenic property, but the score on the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide subscale, especially in the 40-mg group, suggests a dysphorigenic property at high doses. On the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, buspirone and diazepam affected only the sleep factor and only the 40-mg buspirone dose was distinguishable from placebo. On the Single-Dose Questionnaire, both buspirone and diazepam tended to be rated more as sedative-type drugs, but buspirone was generally less well liked than diazepam. Overall, the results, which suggest a lack of euphoria and the presence of dysphoria at high doses, indicate that buspirone has only limited, if any, abuse liability."

OBJECTIVE: Although several mental disorders have been shown to be common in adolescents with substance use disorders, prior studies have not specifically focused on alcohol dependence and have not had sufficient sample sizes to examine gender effects. This study contrasts mental disorder diagnoses and symptoms between a sample of adolescents with alcohol dependence and a community control sample of adolescents and incorporates gender analyses. METHOD: Adolescents (aged 14 years 0 months to 18 years 0 months) with alcohol dependence (females: n = 55; males: n = 78) and community-dwelling control adolescents without substance use disorders (females: n = 44; males: n = 42) were assessed by means of a semistructured interview for DSM-III-R. RESULTS: While cannabis and hallucinogen use disorders were common in the alcohol dependence group, females and males had similar rates. Conduct disorder (CD), oppositional defiant disorder, attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, major depression (MD), and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) had significantly higher rates in the alcohol dependence than in the community control group. Depression and PTSD symptoms were more strongly associated with alcohol dependence in females than in males. A configural frequency analysis showed that CD and MD tended to occur together in both female and male adolescents with alcohol dependence. CONCLUSIONS: While alcohol-dependent females and males similarly exhibited more comorbid disorders than control adolescents, gender affects the relationship of alcohol dependence to MD and PTSD. Rather than reflecting distinct types, the comorbid disorders of CD and MD jointly characterize many adolescents with alcohol dependence."
"7744","1","Effects of methylphenidate and MDMA (ecstasy) on appraisal of erotic stimuli.^
Background: Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it is also increasingly misused recreationally and as cognitive enhancer (neuroenhancer). 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') is a popular recreational club drug mainly used due to its entactogenic properties, i.e. the drug is thought to enhance feelings of sociability, empathy, and closeness to others. Methylphenidate mainly enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas MDMA mainly increases brain serotonin levels. Additionally, both drugs increase noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore have also psychostimulant properties. It is well recognized that psychoactive substances affect sexual perception and behavior. Typically, dopaminergic psychostimulants including methamphetamine and cocaine are reported to enhance sexual drive and to increase sexual pleasure. In contrast, serotonergic drugs such as serotonin uptake inhibitors typically impair sexual arousal and functions (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty reaching orgasm). However, ecstasy users describe inconsistent effects on sexual desire and performance. Some users report feelings of emotional closeness while consuming Ecstasy but no desire for penetrative sex. Others report that ecstasy increased their sexual arousal and some use it specifically for sexual enhancement. It seems that MDMA induces well‐being and feelings of closeness to others accompanied by a sensual rather than a sexual enhancement. However, research on psychoactive drug use and sexual behavior is typically based on interviews of drug users and has mainly focused on sexual risk taking. It remains to be determined, whether methylphenidate and MDMA alter sexual arousal when measured objectively in a laboratory setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli after administration of single doses of methylphenidate, MDMA, or placebo. Methods: We evaluated effects of methylphenidate (40 mg), MDMA (75 mg) and placebo on subjective sexual arousal by viewing erotic pictures using a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled cross‐over design in 30 healthy subjects (15 men, 15 women). In the Sexual Arousal Task (SAT), participants had to evaluate 16 neutral, erotic (implicit sexual), or sexual (explicit sexual) color photographs taken from the International Affective Picture System and to rate how pleasant, exciting/arousing, attractive, likable or erotic they considered these pictures. Results: Methylphenidate significantly increased ratings of arousal compared with both placebo (p<0.01) and MDMA (p<0.001), but only for pictures with an explicit sexual content. Methylphenidate similarly tended to increase ratings of erotic compared with placebo (p<0.05) and MDMA (p<0.05) for pictures with explicit sexual content. MDMA did not alter ratings on any of the dimensions regardless of sexual content. There were no significant differences between male or female participants in any of the ratings or drug effects. Conclusion: Methylphenidate increased ratings of sexual excitation by visual stimuli with explicit sexual content. In contrast, MDMA had no such effects on sexual arousal. The findings indicate that pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic (methylphenidate) but not of serotonergic (MDMA) neurotransmission enhances sexual drive. It needs to be investigated whether sexual perception or even risk‐associated sexual behavior is altered in subjects using methylphenidate for cognitive enhancement or as treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."
"4035","1","Effects of ayahuasca on mental health and quality of life in naïve users: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study combination.^
Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic decoction used as a traditional medicine in several Amazonian regions. The ritualistic use of ayahuasca has spread throughout many countries, making it necessary to study its risks and benefits. Two sub-studies were designed for this investigation. In sub-study 1, a psychiatric interview and a battery of questionnaires were administered to subjects (n = 40) before their first ayahuasca use. Two follow-ups were conducted at 1 and 6 months. In sub-study 2, the same interview and battery of questionnaires were administered to long-term ayahuasca users (n = 23) and their scores were compared with those of the ayahuasca-naïve group. In the first assessment, nearly half (45%) of the naïve users were found to meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. After the ayahuasca use, more than 80% of those subjects showed clinical improvements that persisted at 6 months. The questionnaires showed significant reductions in depression and psychopathology. Regarding sub-study 2, long-term users showed lower depression scores, and higher scores for self-transcendence and quality of life, as compared to their peers in sub-study 1. Further controlled and observational naturalistic studies assessing the eventual risks and potential benefits of ayahuasca are warranted."
"9439","1","Cognitive determinants of MDMA use among college students in Southern Taiwan.^
This study was aimed to examine the Attitudes-Social influence-Efficacy Model for the use of MDMA among college students in Taiwan. A representative sample of 3743 college students participated in this study. Each participant completed a comprehensive survey and 3090 valid data were collected. Correlation analyses displayed that either positive outcome expectancy or social influence was positively related to intention while refusal self-efficacy was negatively associated with intention. Using the Structural Equation Model, the results showed that the model fitted the data well. Intention for using MDMA affected MDMA use. Refusing self-efficacy significantly predicted intention and MDMA use indirectly via intention. Social influence had a direct impact on intention or MDMA use as well as an indirect effect on MDMA use via intention. However, positive outcome expectancy did not have an effect on both intention and the use of MDMA. Our results suggested that preventive programs in colleges for MDMA use should focus on developing strategies in decreasing the social influence and enhancing the refusal self-efficacy. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd.

"4186","1","Proof of mechanism and target engagement of glutamatergic drugs for the treatment of schizophrenia: RCTs of pomaglumetad and TS-134 on ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms and pharmacoBOLD in healthy volunteers.^
Glutamate neurotransmission is a prioritized target for antipsychotic drug development. Two metabotropic glutamate receptor 2/3 (mGluR2/3) agonists (pomaglumetad [POMA] and TS-134) were assessed in two Phase Ib proof of mechanism studies of comparable designs and using identical clinical assessments and pharmacoBOLD methodology. POMA was examined in a randomized controlled trial under double-blind conditions for 10-days at doses of 80 or 320 mg/d POMA versus placebo (1:1:1 ratio). The TS-134 trial was a randomized, single-blind, 6-day study of 20 or 60 mg/d TS-134 versus placebo (5:5:2 ratio). Primary outcomes were ketamine-induced changes in pharmacoBOLD in the dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and symptoms reflected on the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS). Both trials were conducted contemporaneously. 95 healthy volunteers were randomized to POMA and 63 to TS-134. High-dose POMA significantly reduced ketamine-induced BPRS total symptoms within and between-groups (p < 0.01, d = -0.41; p = 0.04, d = -0.44, respectively), but neither POMA dose significantly suppressed ketamine-induced dACC pharmacoBOLD. In contrast, low-dose TS-134 led to moderate to large within and between group reductions in both BPRS positive symptoms (p = 0.02, d = -0.36; p = 0.008, d = -0.82, respectively) and dACC pharmacoBOLD (p = 0.004, d = -0.56; p = 0.079, d = -0.50, respectively) using pooled across-study placebo data. High-dose POMA exerted significant effects on clinical symptoms, but not on target engagement, suggesting a higher dose may yet be needed, while the low dose of TS-134 showed evidence of symptom reduction and target engagement. These results support further investigation of mGluR2/3 and other glutamate-targeted treatments for schizophrenia."
"1365","0","Synthetic Cannabinoids: Use and Predictors in a Community Sample of Young Adults.^
BACKGROUND: Synthetic cannabinoids (SCs) are a class of drugs of abuse with deleterious consequences. Despite governmental regulations related to distribution and sale, SC variants are still available online. More research is needed to determine SC use prevalence and factors associated with SC use, especially among young adults. METHODS: One thousand eighty individuals, 18-25 years old, were surveyed, between January 2012 and July 2013, during recruitment for a randomized controlled trial investigating health behaviors in young adults. Advertisements were placed online and in community locations seeking individuals ""who had recently used marijuana or alcohol."" Respondents were queried about their use of alcohol and drugs, including SCs, in the last month. RESULTS: Participants averaged 21.4 years old and were 53.4% male. Nearly 59% were non-Hispanic white, 15% were African American, 15% were Hispanic, and 11% identified as other. Approximately 9% reported SC use in the last month, a level higher than the reported use of opioids, cocaine, or hallucinogens. SC use was significantly associated with male gender, not being enrolled in school, and with use of cigarettes, binge alcohol drinking, daily and weekly marijuana use, and other drugs of abuse. There was a significant decrease in SC use after the federal ban in July 2012. CONCLUSIONS: SC use was common in the past month and often overlaps with other drug use, particularly marijuana use, and should be asked about during clinical encounters with young adults."
"6826","1","Low doses of ketamine reduce delirium but not opiate consumption in mechanically ventilated and sedated ICU patients: A randomised double-blind control trial.^
CONTEXT: Low doses of ketamine are commonly used to decrease opiates tolerance, hyperalgesia and delirium in perioperative theatre but these properties have never been studied in intensive care unit (ICU) patients. PURPOSE: To determine the impact of ketamine infusion on opiates consumption when added to standard care in ICU patients requiring sedation for mechanical ventilation. METHODS: Patients admitted in a general ICU of a university hospital and undergoing mechanical ventilation (n = 162) with nurse-driven sedation protocol were randomly assigned into ketamine (2 mg/kg/h) or placebo in a double-blinded control trial. Patients were assessed for sedation and analgesia levels, opiates consumption and delirium (using the Confusion Assessment Method for ICU). RESULTS: Daily consumption of remifentanil (7.9 ± 1.0 vs. 9.3 ± 1.0 μg/kg/h, P = 0.548) and increase in remifentanil doses required for equianalgesia (0.107 ± 0.17 and 0.11 ± 0.18 μg/kg/min, P = 0.78) were not different between ketamine and control groups. The incidence was higher in the placebo group 30/82 (37%) than in the ketamine group 17/80 (21%) (P = 0.03). The duration of delirium was lower in ketamine group (5.3 ± 4.7 vs. 2.8 ± 3 days, P = 0.005). Mortality rates, ventilator-free days and ICU length of stay (LOS) were non-statistically different in both groups. CONCLUSIONS: When the best practices of sedation (nurse-driven sedation, a consistent light-to-moderate sedation level, and delirium monitoring) are used for all patients, the addition of low doses of ketamine does not decrease opiate consumption but reduces delirium incidence and its duration in medico-surgical ICU patients with no effect on mortality rate and ICU LOS."
"5121","1","Family history of alcohol dependence and antidepressant response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist in bipolar depression.^
OBJECTIVES: Both ketamine and ethanol are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Ketamine has rapid antidepressant properties in major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as bipolar depression. In individuals with MDD, a positive family history of alcohol dependence (FHP) was associated with greater improvement in depressive symptoms after ketamine administration compared to individuals whose family history of alcohol dependence was negative (FHN). This study investigated whether FHP influences ketamine's antidepressant and perceptual effects in individuals with bipolar depression. METHODS: A post hoc analysis was conducted on 33 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (BD) type I or II depression pooled from two previously published studies. All subjects had undergone a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial of a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) combined with lithium or valproate therapy. Subjects were rated at baseline; at 40, 80, 120, and 230 min; and at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-infusion. The primary outcome measure was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. Patients were categorized as FHP when they reported at least one first-degree relative with alcohol dependence. Measures of psychosis, dissociation, and dysphoria were also collected. RESULTS: After ketamine infusion, subjects with FHP showed significantly greater improvement on MADRS scores than FHN subjects. In addition, patients with FHP had attenuated psychotomimetic and dissociative scores compared to FHN patients. CONCLUSIONS: FHP appears to predict a more sustained antidepressant response to ketamine in individuals with BD. Family history of alcoholism may be an important consideration in the development of glutamatergic-based therapies for depression."
"1981","1","Comparative effectiveness of esketamine in the treatment of anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^
BACKGROUND: Anhedonia is a symptom associated with poorer outcomes in depression treatment, including resistance to treatment, higher functional impact and suicidality. Few drugs are known to adequately treat anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depression. The NMDA antagonist ketamine has been demonstrated to be effective in rapidly ameliorating anhedonia in depressive episodes. The main aim of present study is to evaluate the anti-anhedonic effect of esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine recently approved for treatment-resistant depression, in unipolar and bipolar depression. METHODS: 70 patients with unipolar or bipolar depression were treated with 6 weekly subcutaneous esketamine infusions (0.5-1mg/kg). Anhedonia was measured through MADRS item 8 before and 24h after each infusion. RESULTS: A significant reduction in anhedonia severity was observed (p<0.0001) after 6 infusions. The effect was statistically significant 24h after the first infusion (p<0.001) in both unipolar and bipolar groups and increased with repeated infusions. Anti-anhedonic effect of esketamine did not differ between groups. LIMITATIONS: This is an open-label, real-world study. Lack of blinding and of a placebo arm may limit the interpretation of findings. CONCLUSION: Although preliminary, present findings suggest that repeated subcutaneous esketamine infusions are effective for the treatment of anhedonia in both unipolar and bipolar depressed patients. These results need to be confirmed through replication in larger double-blinded controlled trials."
"5903","0","Adolescents are more sensitive than adults to acute behavioral and cognitive effects of THC.^
Increased cannabis availability has contributed to increased use with concomitant incidence of adverse effects. One risk factor for adverse drug reactions may be age. There is preclinical evidence that acute effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the primary active constituent of cannabis, are greater during adolescence, but this has not been fully studied in humans. The present study sought to determine whether adolescent men and women are more sensitive than adults to acute THC. Adolescents aged 18-20 (N = 12) and adults aged 30-40 (N = 12), with less than 20 total lifetime uses of THC-containing products, received capsules of THC (7.5, 15 mg) and placebo across three study sessions in randomized order under double blind conditions. During each session, subjective, cardiovascular, behavioral, and EEG measures were obtained. Behavioral measures included Simple Reaction Time, Stop Task, Time Production and N-back and EEG measures included P300 amplitudes during an auditory oddball task and eyes-closed resting state. THC affected subjective state and heart rate similarly in both age groups. However, adolescents were more sensitive to performance impairing effects, exhibiting dose-dependent impairments on reaction time, response accuracy, and time perception. On EEG measures, THC dose-dependently decreased P300 amplitude in adolescents but not adults. Adolescents were more sensitive to behavioral and cognitive effects of THC, but not to cardiovascular effects or subjective measures. Thus, at doses that produce comparable ratings of intoxication, adolescents may exhibit greater cognitive impairment and alterations in brain function."

The aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE (3,4-methylene dioxyethamphetamine) on cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers and to correlate neurometabolism with acute psychopathology. In a randomized double-blind trial, 15 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 110-120 min after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). Two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, constant cognitive stimulation was started and maintained for 32 min using a word repetition paradigm to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral glucose uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using Tl-weighted 3D flash magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by manual regionalization into 108 regions of interest and PET/MRI overlay. After absolute quantification of rMRGlu and normalization to global metabolism, normalized rMRGlu under MDE was compared to placebo using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Acute psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and rMRGlu was correlated to PANSS scores according to Spearman. MDE subjects showed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, P < 0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, P < 0.05). On the other hand, rMRGlu was significantly increased in the bilateral cerebellum (right: +10.1%, P < 0.05; left: +7.6%, P < 0.05) and in the right putamen (+6.2%, P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity (r = 0.87, P < 0.05), both the right amygdala (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) and the left posterior cingulate (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) to difficulties in abstract thinking, and the right frontal inferior (r = 0.85, P < 0.05), right anterior cingulate (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), and left anterior cingulate (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) to attentional deficits. A negative correlation was found between the left frontal operculum (Broca's area) and attentional deficits (r = -0.85, P < 0.05). The present study revealed acute neurometabolic changes under the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE, indicating a frontostriatocerebellar imbalance paralleling other psychotropic substances or various psychiatric disorders."
"3151","0","Acute effects of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol on auditory mismatch negativity.^
RATIONALE: Mismatch negativity (MMN) is a candidate endophenotype for schizophrenia subserved by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) function and there is increasing evidence that prolonged cannabis use adversely affects MMN generation. Few human studies have investigated the acute effects of cannabinoids on brain-based biomarkers of NMDAR function and synaptic plasticity. OBJECTIVES: The current study investigated the acute effects of Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) alone and in combination on the mismatch negativity (MMN). METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, crossover placebo-controlled study, 18 frequent and 18 less-frequent cannabis users underwent 5 randomised drug sessions administered via vaporiser: (1) placebo; (2) THC 8 mg; (3) CBD 400 mg; (4) THC 8 mg + CBD 4 mg [THC + CBD(low)]; (5) THC 12 mg + CBD 400 mg [THC + CBD(high)]. Participants completed a multifeature MMN auditory oddball paradigm with duration, frequency and intensity deviants (6% each). RESULTS: Relative to placebo, both THC and CBD were observed to increase duration and intensity MMN amplitude in less-frequent users, and THC also increased frequency MMN in this group. The addition of low-dose CBD added to THC attenuated the effect of THC on duration and intensity MMN amplitude in less-frequent users. The same pattern of effects was observed following high-dose CBD added to THC on duration and frequency MMN in frequent users. CONCLUSIONS: The pattern of effects following CBD combined with THC on MMN may be subserved by different underlying neurobiological interactions within the endocannabinoid system that vary as a function of prior cannabis exposure. These results highlight the complex interplay between the acute effects of exogenous cannabinoids and NMDAR function. Further research is needed to determine how this process normalises after the acute effects dissipate and following repeated acute exposure."
"2004","1","Interaction of Sex and Age on the Dissociative Effects of Ketamine Action in Young Healthy Participants.^
Ketamine is a drug that reduces depressive and elicits schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans. However, it is largely unexplored whether women and men differ with respect to ketamine-action and whether age contributes to drug-effects. In this study we assessed dissociative symptoms via the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) in a total of 69 healthy subjects aged between 18 and 30 years (early adulthood) after ketamine or placebo infusion. Dissociative symptoms were generally increased only in the ketamine group post-infusion. Specifically, within the ketamine group, men reported significantly more depersonalization and amnestic symptoms than women. Furthermore, with rising age only men were less affected overall with respect to dissociative symptoms. This suggests a sex-specific protective effect of higher age which may be due to delayed brain maturation in men compared to women. We conclude that it is crucial to include sex and age in studies of drug effects in general and of ketamine-action in specific to tailor more efficient psychiatric treatments.

"3767","1","Self-medication with psychedelic microdoses amongst microdosers with disorders.^
Background: A substantial number of people worldwide suffer from mental health problems during their lifetime. Although standard therapy and prescriptions are often effective, it is known that treatment is not a ""one‐size‐fits‐all"" cure; many patients experience unbearable side effects, and some never reach remission. In light of this, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, with preliminary clinical trials using 'regular' full psychedelic doses demonstrating promising results. Over the last couple of years, the use of low 'micro' doses of psychedelics for health‐related purposes has received increased visibility and interest to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression or pain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that next to regular psychedelic doses, low doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing for symptomatic relief is lacking and no scientific effort is made to inquire on a larger scale for which conditions people use psychedelic microdoses and whether they deem this to be more effective than standard treatments (ST) or 'regular' high psychedelic doses (HPD). The present study therefore investigated the self‐rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP), compared to ST and HDP. Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora for four months. In total 63% (N = 3'590) of the people who initially clicked the link consented and were 18 years of age or older and completed the survey. Of them, 7.2% (N = 410) had experience with microdosing and was diagnosed by a medical doctor or therapist with at least one mental or physical disorder. This group was included in the analyses. Respondents were asked which psychedelics they used to selfmedicate with, for which condition and whether they experienced it as effective. The latter was assessed with three questions: 'Do you feel the treatment worked' (Q1), 'did the symptoms disappear' (Q2), and 'did your quality of life improve' (Q3). Binary logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) was conducted to compare the SRE with psychedelic microdoses with ST, and HDP, for the mental and physical disorder diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions. When cell count was less than 10 events per independent variable, no regression was conducted. For each OR, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given and statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. An OR of 1.5 is defined as small, two as medium, and three as large. Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was statistically higher (p < 0.01) compared to that of ST for both mental (OR(Q1) = 2.3; OR(Q2) = 2.48; OR(Q3) = 2.77) and physical (OR(Q1) = 6.14; OR(Q2) = 7.74; OR(Q3) = 4.36) diagnoses. These effects were specific for neurodevelopmental and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression (OR (Q1) = 0.15; OR(Q2) = 0.31; OR(Q3) = 0.13; p(OR Q1,2,3) < 0.01), while for physical disorders no difference was shown (OR(Q1) = 0.45, p = 0.27; OR(Q2) = 0.79, p = 0.79; OR(Q3) = 0.25, p = 0.09). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physical diagnoses is higher compared to ST and lower than HDP. Findings provide a rationale to assess indications of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics using randomized clinical trials in patient populations, and support assessment of effectivity claims of psychedelics, and whether these are dose‐related, disorder‐specific and superior to ST."
"5003","0","Do Psychedelics Facilitate Emergence of Unconscious Psychological Processes?.^
Psychedelic substances have a long history of use in traditional healing and religious ceremonies worldwide and are increasingly being investigated for their possible therapeutic usage. However, there is still a lack of consensus regarding how best to characterize the psychological effects of psychedelics and how they bring about the positive therapeutic outcomes observed in clinical studies. The aim of this article is to review available evidence from quantitative and qualitative studies on psychedelic-assisted therapy, as well as neurobiological studies, in relation to the hypothesis that psychedelics facilitate the emergence of emotionally charged unconscious material, originally proposed by pioneering psychedelics researcher Stanislav Grof. The reviewed process studies of therapeutic mechanisms in psychedelic-assisted therapy and qualitative studies of treatment participants clearly indicate that the psychedelic experience is associated with the subjective experience of having increased access to and awareness of emotions, memories, and perceptions that are normally avoided or outside of conscious awareness. Brain-imaging studies point to several different neurobiological effects of psychedelics that might be related to these subjective psychological experiences. Available evidence also indicates that this process might constitute an important therapeutic mechanism in psychedelic-assisted therapy, worthy of further investigation."
"364","0","Ketamine for Depression, 2: Diagnostic and Contextual Indications.^
There is a substantial body of literature comprising anecdotal material and descriptions of uncontrolled and randomized controlled trials addressing the use of subanesthetic doses of ketamine for the off-label treatment of major depressive episodes. This article examines diagnostic indications for the off-label use of ketamine as an antidepressant and possible contexts in which ketamine may be trialled. Ketamine is indicated in patients who are in a major depressive episode. Most of the research data have been collected from patients with major depressive disorder, but patients with bipolar depression have also been studied. Ketamine is effective in both diagnostic groups, but its benefits are impermanent, perhaps more so in bipolar depression. There are several contexts within this diagnostic framework when a ketamine trial may be considered. These include severe depression and depression that is refractory to conventional antidepressant medication; this is because there is little purpose in trialling an experimental treatment in patients who are less severely ill and those who are antidepressant responsive. More importantly, ketamine has demonstrated efficacy in the rapid reduction of suicidal symptoms and can therefore be trialled when rapid reduction in suicidality is necessary. Likewise, because of its swift and dramatic antidepressant action, it can be trialled in patients in whom improvement is urgently desired in order to allow the patient to attend to pressing life circumstances. Some data suggest that the use of ketamine early during the course of an antidepressant trial, or as anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy, can improve early antidepressant outcomes. It is not clear whether the presence of psychotic symptoms is a contraindication for ketamine use. Issues related to these indications and contexts are briefly discussed."

BACKGROUND: High risk of alcohol and drug use disorders in people with attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) calls for exploratory research of relationships with clinical features of ADHD. AIM: To estimate prevalence of alcohol/drug use disorders and associations with ADHD symptom severity and emotional dysregulation, in adults with ADHD. METHODS: This observational cross-sectional clinical study consisted of patients admitted to a private psychiatric outpatient clinic in Oslo, Norway (2014-2018). Five-hundred and fifty-eight eligible patients diagnosed with ADHD (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5) criteria) agreed to participate. Alcohol and drug use disorders were diagnosed using the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Dependence and abuse were merged into ""use"" disorder as in MINI version 7.0/DSM-5. Questions were related both to lifetime and the past 12-mo. ADHD severity was assessed by the Adult ADHD Self Report Scale (ASRS). Subdivisions of the ASRS questionnaire as inattentive items and hyperactive/impulsivity items were recorded separately. Emotional dysregulation was assessed by the eight-item version of Barkley's Current Behavior Scale - Self Report. RESULTS: The 12-mo prevalence was 5.3% for alcohol use disorder and 13.7% for drug use disorder. The lifetime prevalence was 12.0% for alcohol use disorder and 27.7% for drug use disorder. Men had higher rates of both alcohol use disorder and drug use disorder compared to women. The prevalence of drug use disorder was more than twice that of alcohol use disorder for both sexes. The drugs most participants reported having used were (in descending order): Amphetamine (19.1%), cannabis (17.1%), cocaine or ecstasy (7.4%), benzodiazepines (7.4%), and heroin or other opioids (2.9%). Lifetime drug use disorder was significantly associated with both hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and emotional dysregulation symptom severity. Lifetime alcohol use disorder, on the other hand, was not significantly associated with ADHD symptoms or emotional dysregulation when adjusted for gender and age. CONCLUSION: Patients with ADHD have a high lifetime prevalence of drug use disorder, which is associated with higher levels of hyperactivity-impulsivity symptoms and emotional dysregulation."
"6256","1","MDMA-Assisted CBCT for PTSD vs CBCT RCT.^
This study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of MDMA‐assisted Cognitive‐Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) versus CBCT alone for the treatment of Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a debilitating condition that significantly impacts interpersonal relationships and the functioning of individuals and their loved ones. There is also a well‐established reciprocal relationship between interpersonal relationships, PTSD, and recovery. CBCT is a manualized treatment for PTSD that simultaneously addresses PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction. It provides dyads with behavioral tools to navigate PTSD‐related challenges, as well as the knowledge behind PTSD and how it impacts relationships. Previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of CBCT in improving PTSD symptoms, partner functioning, and relationship satisfaction in both distressed and non‐distressed dyads. MDMA is a drug commonly used recreationally that has been increasingly studied because of its ability to reduce the impact of PTSD symptoms. The effects of MDMA are reduced fear, enhanced communication, trust and introspection, and increased empathy and compassion. The effects of MDMA create a state that enhances the positive effects of therapy by increasing the ability to tolerate negative emotions and allowing clients to stay engaged in therapy without being overwhelmed by the intense emotions surrounding the memories of traumatic events. It is believed that MDMA may help promote the effects of CBCT due to its ability to induce empathy and interpersonal openness. This randomized study is the second study designed to explore the efficacy of combining MDMA‐assisted therapy with CBCT. This study will enroll 30 dyads, where one individual has symptoms of PTSD. Participants will undergo a 7‐week psychotherapy course, in MDMA‐assisted CBCT or CBCT alone. In the MDMA‐assisted CBCT, participants will go through CBCT sessions, and two doses of MDMA will be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Participants assigned to the CBCT‐only condition will go through CBCT sessions and will have the opportunity to crossover and receive the two MDMA sessions after follow‐up. The primary goal of this research is to contribute to the literature on MDMA‐assisted CBCT by investigating its feasibility, safety, acceptability, and effectiveness, and by comparing it to active PTSD treatments."

Previous research has found gender differences in both psychological and physiological responses to drugs. The present investigation explores gender variability in patterns of drug use in relation to self-reported depression, anxiety, and somatization. The current study confirms that heavy illegal drug users are represented by a preponderance of males than females. However, within each drug group category, females generally reported higher psychopathology scores than males. This was significant for all three subscales in the alcohol/tobacco group, for depression scores in the alcohol/tobacco, cannabis/alcohol, and light Ecstasy users group, and for depression scores for the alcohol group. Interestingly, in the male sample, drug users reported higher symptom ratings than nondrug users, whereas women's scores remained constant across drug groups."

METHOD: Plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, 110, 230 min on day 1, 2 and 3 in nine patients following a 40 min infusion of (R,S)-Ket (0.5 mg kg⁻¹) and analyzed for Ket, norKet and DHNK enantiomers and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK. A compartmental popPK model was constructed that included all quantified analytes, and unknown parameters were estimated with an iterative two-stage algorithm in ADAPT5. RESULTS: Ket, norKet, DHNK and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK were present during the first 230 min post infusion and significant concentrations (>5 ng ml⁻¹) were observed on day 1. Plasma concentrations of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK were below the limit of quantification. The average (S) : (R) plasma concentrations for Ket and DHNK were <1.0 while no significant enantioselectivity was observed for norKet. There were large inter-patient variations in terminal half-lives and relative metabolite concentrations; at 230 min (R,S)-DHNK was the major metabolite in four out of nine patients, (R,S)-norKet in three out of nine patients and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK in two out of nine patients. The final PK model included three compartments for (R,S)-Ket, two compartments for (R,S)-norKet and single compartments for DHNK and HNK. All PK profiles were well described, and parameters for (R,S)-Ket and (R,S)-norKet were in agreement with prior estimates. CONCLUSION: This represents the first PK analysis of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK and (R,S)-DHNK. The results demonstrate that while norKet is the initial metabolite, it is not the main metabolite suggesting that future Ket studies should include the analysis of the major metabolites."

Depression is part of the normal spectrum of human experience. At its extreme it exists as a syndrome characterized by pervasive low mood and absence of enjoyment, disproportionately negative thought patterns, disturbed sleep and appetite, difficulty concentrating, and suicidal thoughts and acts. The classic psychedelic drugs were used as catalysts in psychotherapy for depression prior to their prohibition around 1970. Most trials before this time were methodologically suboptimal and it remains unclear whether they are safe and effective treatments, although a recent systematic review suggested broadly positive clinical effects without a high risk of serious adverse reactions. This chapter discusses the modern resurgence of interest in psychedelics, particularly psilocybin, in the treatment of depression. It discusses the process of gathering evidence through the clinical trials process in order to make an application for licensing, with commentary on where the field lies within this process as of July 2018. Finally, the chapter discusses, through a mixture of evidence and a degree of speculation, how recent basic neuroscience and neuroimaging work may reflect the core subjective psychedelic experience and how this may reflect a therapeutic mechanism that emphasizes the syndrome of depression as a shared emotional and existential predicament.

Low-frequency (<4 Hz) neural activity, particularly in the delta band, is generally indicative of loss of consciousness and cortical down states, particularly when it is diffuse and high amplitude. Remarkably, however, drug challenge studies of several diverse classes of pharmacological agents-including drugs which treat epilepsy, activate GABA(B) receptors, block acetylcholine receptors, or produce psychedelic effects-demonstrate neural activity resembling cortical down states even as the participants remain conscious. Of those substances that are safe to use in healthy volunteers, some may be highly valuable research tools for investigating which neural activity patterns are sufficient for consciousness or its absence."

"4112","1","A Systematic Review on the Efficacy of Intravenous Racemic Ketamine for Bipolar Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the efficacy of intravenous ketamine augmentation in treatment-resistant depression patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Major databases were searched for open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCT). Two independent reviewers screened and selected the studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were selected following the standard Cochrane methodology, and the findings are reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using standardized measures. RESULTS: A total of 1442 articles were screened. Five studies were included in the systematic review (3 RCTs and 2 open-label studies) enrolling 110 subjects (mean age, 45.54 ± 12.65 years; 68.18% female). All the RCTs and open-label studies showed improvement in depressions symptoms after receiving a single infusion of ketamine. Included studies also suggested improvement in suicidal ideation and anhedonia after ketamine infusion. Dissociation and transient increase in blood pressure were the most common reported adverse effects with ketamine. Ketamine infusions did not increase mania symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data show efficacy and feasibility of intravenous racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant bipolar depression. Further studies with larger sample size are required to strengthen the evidence."
"793","1","Subjective and Behavioral Effects of Microdoses of LSD in Healthy Human Volunteers.^
Background: There have been numerous anecdotal reports that very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) reduce depressed mood and improve positive outlook. Yet, the effects of such “microdoses” have not been tested under double‐blind, placebo‐controlled conditions. As a first step, we examined the subjective and behavioral effects of single low doses of LSD in healthy adults. Methods: Volunteers (N=20) attended four laboratory sessions during with they received placebo, 6.5μg, 13μg, or 26μg LSD in randomized order. During expected peak drug effect, they completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing, including i) recognition of emotional facial expressions and ii) responses to simulated social rejection. Results: LSD dose‐dependently increased ratings of “feeling” the drug, “liking” the drug, and “feeling high,” in addition to dose‐dependently increasing responses to the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. The highest dose of LSD increased vigor, elation, and anxiety on the Profile of Mood States. On the emotion recognition task, LSD enhanced participants’ ability to recognize both anger and happiness. During the simulated social rejection task, LSD increased participants’ desire to play again with the other players, but did not affect their perception of the degree to which they were included or excluded. Conclusions: These findings with non‐symptomatic volunteers suggest that “microdoses” of LSD have dose‐dependent effects on mood and emotional behavior. These results set the stage for measuring the clinical efficacy of the drug in the treatment of depressed mood, and help to understand the expanding use of low doses of LSD in the community.

PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Numerous health authority approvals of esketamine nasal spray, combined with oral antidepressant, to treat depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder and acute suicidal ideation or behavior were based on 2 identically designed, double-blind, phase 3 studies. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Across both ASPIRE studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133), patients (N = 456) were randomized to esketamine 84 mg or placebo nasal spray twice weekly for 4 weeks plus comprehensive standard of care, including hospitalization and newly initiated or optimized antidepressant(s). In post hoc analyses of pooled data, changes from baseline at 24 hours after the first dose in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised, in the full cohort and in subgroups, were analyzed using analysis of covariance. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Esketamine plus standard of care demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score versus placebo plus standard of care at 24 hours (least square mean difference [95% confidence interval], -3.8 [-5.75 to -1.89]) and at earlier (4 hours: -3.4 [-5.05 to -1.71]) and later time points (day 25: -3.4 [-5.36 to -1.36]). The between-group difference (95% confidence interval) for change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised at 24 hours was -0.20 (-0.43 to 0.04) for all patients and -0.31 (-0.61 to -0.01) for those with a history of suicide attempt. Common adverse events (≥20%) during esketamine treatment were dizziness, dissociation, nausea, somnolence, and headache. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine plus comprehensive standard of care rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have acute suicidal ideation or behavior, especially in those with a history of suicide attempt, providing a new treatment option for this particularly ill and vulnerable population."
"4867","0","Agitated depression in substance dependence.^
Background: Depression with psychomotor agitation (PMA; "" agitated depression"") is a putative psychiatric phenotype that appears to associate with some forms of substance dependence. However, it is unclear whether such relationships extend across different substances and independent (I-MDE) versus substance-induced (SI-MDE) subtypes of major depressive episodes. Method: We examined whether lifetime depression with (vs. without) PMA was associated with lifetime substance dependence across individuals with lifetime: (1) I-MDE only (n= 575); and (2) SI-MDE only (n= 1683). Data were pooled from several family and genetic studies of substance dependence in which participants received identical structured interviews to diagnose DSM-IV mental disorders. Results: In I-MDE, PMA was significantly associated with alcohol, cocaine, opioid, other drug (hallucinogen, inhalant, speed-ball), and sedative dependence. After controlling for demographic and clinical co-factors, PMA's relationship to dependence on opioids, other drugs, and sedatives remained significant, but not its relationship to alcohol or cocaine. In SI-MDE, PMA was significantly associated with alcohol, cocaine, opioid, and other drug dependence. After adjusting for co-factors, associations remained significant for dependence on cocaine and opioids, but not alcohol or other drugs. Relationships between PMA and opioid dependence were stronger in I-MDE than SI-MDE. Depression subtype (I-MDE vs. SI-MDE) did not moderate relations between PMA and non-opioid forms of substance dependence. Conclusions: Agitated depression associates with certain forms of substance dependence, particularly opioid dependence. MDE subtype did not alter most PMA-dependence associations, which suggests that the mechanisms underlying this comorbidity are complex and potentially bidirectional. © 2011."
"9280","0","Sex differences in sub-anesthetic ketamine's antidepressant effects and abuse liability.^
Sub-anesthetic ketamine produces rapid antidepressant effects in patients with bipolar and unipolar major depression where conventional monoaminergic-based antidepressant drugs have been ineffective or ridden with side effects. A single ketamine infusion can produce antidepressant effects lasting up to two weeks, and multiple ketamine infusions prolong this effect. Pre-clinical studies are underway to uncover ketamine's mechanisms of action, but there are still many questions unanswered regarding the safety of its long-term use. Abuse liability is one area of concern, as recreational ketamine use is an ongoing issue in many parts of the world. Another understudied area is sex differences in responsivity to ketamine. Women are twice as likely as men to be diagnosed with depression, and they progress through stages of drug addiction more rapidly than their male counterparts. Despite this, preclinical studies in ketamine's antidepressant and addictive-like behaviors in females are limited. These intersecting factors in recent clinical and pre-clinical studies are reviewed to characterize ketamine's therapeutic potential, its limitations, and its potential mechanisms of action.

"8910","1","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^
RATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both."

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), described as a classical hallucinogen, began its journey from the middle of the last century following an accidental discovery. Since then, it was used as a popular and notorious substance of abuse in various parts of the world. Its beneficial role as an adjunct to psychotherapy was much unknown, until some ‘benevolent’ experiments were carried out over time to explore some of its potential uses. But, many of its effects were unclear and seemed to be a psychedelic enigma. In this review article, we have described the receptor pharmacology, mechanism of action, effects and adverse effects of LSD on the normal body system. We have also highlighted its addictive potentials and the chances of developing tolerance. We have assimilated some of the interesting therapeutic uses of this drug, such as an antianxiety agent, a creativity enhancer, a suggestibility enhancer, and a performance enhancer. We have also described LSD to be successfully used in drug and alcohol dependence, and as a part of psychedelic peak therapy in terminally ill patients. The relevant chronological history and literature in the light of present knowledge and scenarios have been discussed. Based on available evidence, LSD could be tried therapeutically in certain specific conditions under controlled settings. But as we mention, due to all the safety concerns, the use of this nonaddictive ‘entheogen’ in actual practice warrants a lot of expertise, caution, cooperation and ethical considerations."
"8956","1","Learning, memory, and executive function in new MDMA users: A 2-year follow-up study.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is associated with changes in neurocognitive performance. Recent studies in laboratory animals have provided additional support for the neurodegeneration hypothesis. However, results from animal research need to be applied to humans with caution. Moreover, several of the studies that examine MDMA users suffer from methodological shortcomings. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was designed in order to overcome these previous methodological shortcomings and to assess the relationship between the continuing use of MDMA and cognitive performance in incipient MDMA users. It was hypothesized that, depending on the amount of MDMA taken, the continued use of MDMA over a 2-year period would lead to further decreases in cognitive performance, especially in visual paired association learning tasks. Ninety-six subjects were assessed, at the second follow-up assessment: 31 of these were non-users, 55 moderate-users, and 10 heavy-users. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted for each cognitive domain, including attention and information processing speed, episodic memory, and executive functioning. Furthermore, possible confounders including age, general intelligence, cannabis use, alcohol use, use of other concomitant substances, recent medical treatment, participation in sports, level of nutrition, sleep patterns, and subjective well-being were assessed. The Repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) revealed that a marginally significant change in immediate and delayed recall test performances of visual paired associates learning had taken place within the follow-up period of 2 years. No further deterioration in continuing MDMA-users was observed in the second follow-up period. No significant differences with the other neuropsychological tests were noted. It seems that MDMA use can impair visual paired associates learning in new users. However, the groups differed in their use of concomitant use of illicit drugs. Therefore, performance differences between the groups cannot completely ascribed to the use of MDMA."

Ibogaine is a psychoactive substance that may reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms. This was the first clinical trial of noribogaine, ibogaine's active metabolite, in patients established on methadone opioid substitution therapy (OST). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of noribogaine in 27 patients seeking to discontinue methadone OST who had been switched to morphine during the previous week. Noribogaine doses were 60, 120, or 180 mg (n = 6/dose level) or matching placebo (n = 3/dose level). Noribogaine was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were noneuphoric changes in light perception ∼1 hour postdose, headache, and nausea. Noribogaine had dose-linear increases for AUC and C(max) and was slowly eliminated (mean t(1/2) range, 24-30 hours). There was a concentration-dependent increase in QTcI (0.17 ms/ng/mL), with the largest observed mean effect of ∼16, 28, and 42 milliseconds in the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg groups, respectively. Noribogaine showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward decreased total score in opioid withdrawal ratings, most notably at the 120-mg dose; however, the study design may have confounded evaluations of time to resumption of OST. Future exposure-controlled multiple-dose noribogaine studies are planned that will address these safety and design issues."

INTRODUCTION: This study explored the current knowledge, attitudes, and clinical practices regarding psychedelics among mental health professionals in California, where state legislation to decriminalize psychedelics has been proposed. METHOD: Two hundred thirty-seven mental health providers (74% female; mean age 54; 83% White; 46% psychologists) completed a 37-item online survey between November 2021 and February 2022, disseminated through local and state-wide professional organizations in California. RESULTS: Providers endorsed limited knowledge about the risks and benefits of psychedelic use (M = 4.7 and 5.4, respectively, with 10 = high knowledge) and inadequate knowledge to counsel patients on use (45%). Gaps in knowledge related to psychedelic drug scheduling and current use in clinical research were identified. Providers expressed support for additional psychedelic research (97%), approval of recreational (66%) and medical (91%) psychedelic use, belief in the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics (89%), and concerns about safety (33%) and potential psychiatric risks (27%). Results indicated that most providers discuss psychedelic use with patients (73%), yet many do not feel comfortable addressing the effects of use (49%). There were significant correlations between knowledge and attitudes towards psychedelics (r = 0.2, p = .006; r = 0.31, p < .001) and attitudes and clinical practices (r = 0.34, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that providers are interested in psychedelic-assisted treatments and hold favourable attitudes towards the therapeutic use of psychedelics yet lack the knowledge to appropriately counsel patients, highlighting the need for additional provider education about psychedelics."
"4967","1","Autonomic, cardiovascular, and endocrine effects of LSD in healthy subjects.^
Introduction: LSD is used recreationally worldwide and there is renewed interest in using LSD in clinical psychiatric research and practice. However, there is limited data on the somatic and endocrine effects of LSD in humans. Method: LSD (200 μg) and placebo were administered to 16 healthy subjects (eight women, eight men) in a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over study. Cardiostimulant effects (blood pressure and heart rate), autonomic effects (body temperature and pupillary function), endocrine effects, and adverse effects were repeatedly assessed. Results: LSD induced positive mood, visual perceptual alterations, and audio‐visual synesthesia lasting for 12h. LSD significantly increased blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD elevated the plasma concentrations of cortisol, prolactin, oxytocin, and epinephrine but not norepinephrine. LSD impaired psychomotor performance (balance) and produced adverse side effects (difficulty concentrating, headache, exhaustion, dizziness) up to 24 h, which completely subsided within 72 h. No severe acute adverse effects were observed. Conclusion: The hallucinogen LSD produces significant sympathomimetic effects. The LSD‐induced increase in cortisol and prolactin is consistent with LSD's serotonergic properties. The cardiostimulant properties of LSD need to be considered in patients with hypertension or heart disease."
"7860","1","Debunking the myth of 'Blue Mondays': No evidence of affect drop after taking clinical MDMA.^
BACKGROUND: Incorporating 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to psychotherapy has shown promise in recent years for treating various mental health conditions, particularly those involving trauma. However, concerns about declines in mood and cognition during the days following dosing, also known as 'Blue Mondays', have been raised as limitations to its clinical use. Although these changes have been well-documented among recreational users, there are critical confounds to these reports that limit generalizability to clinically administered MDMA. AIMS: Here, we aimed to evaluate the evidence basis for the negative side effects associated with MDMA as well as inform our understanding of the drug's post-acute effects in a clinical context with an open-label study. METHODS: The current open-label study examined MDMA therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD; N = 14) and measured mood, sleep quality, illicit MDMA consumption and anecdotal reports after the acute drug effects had worn off. RESULTS: Participants maintained a positive mood during the week following drug administration in a clinical context. Relative to baseline, self-reported sleep quality improved at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Finally, no participants reported using or desiring to use illicit MDMA, and the anecdotal reports indicated that they perceived the treatment favourably. CONCLUSION: The results support the overall safety and tolerability of clinically administered MDMA and, importantly, suggest that the 'come downs' previously associated with the substance may be explained by confounds in research relating to the illicit sourcing of the drug and specific environmental setting for recreational consumption."

Interest of the work: Multiple sclerosis (MS) disease modifying therapies (DMT) utilization increased during the last decade with the approval of new drugs. Symptomatic treatments also play an important role. Describing time trends and demographic characteristics for DMT and symptomatic treatments utilization in population-based MS patients will lead to a better knowledge of the resources distribution. Methods: Repeated cross-sectional analysis on each calendar year were implemented retrospectively on the health insurance claims database in France from 2013 until 2015 regarding DMT, fampridine, fluoxetine, psychiatrist office visits, and Physical therapy sessions to calculate an utilization rate defined as the number of MS patients (whenever the date of diagnosis) who filled at least 1 prescription or service within the studied calendar year per cent MS patients covered the same calendar year (number of users per cent MS population per annum). Beneficiaries with MS were identified by their exemption of co-payment for long-term disease (ALD). Results: DMT utilization rate increased from 34.22% in 2013 to 38.73% in 2015. The increase was due to recently developed DMT as first-generation DMT utilization rate decreased from 30.20% to 20.06%. Rates were not different between genders but significantly decreased with age. The average age of users was significantly lower for DMT than for symptomatic treatments (recently developed DMT: 43.63, first-generation DMT: 45.84, psychiatrist office visits: 49.08, Fampyra®: 55.41, Physical therapy sessions: 55.88, fluoxetine: 58.26). Regional DMT utilization rates ranged from 31.68% in Auvergne-Rhône-Alpes to 42.58% in Normandie. They were not correlated to regional rates of MS prevalence (R-Square = 0.0558; P = 0.2556) nor to the presence of a MS reference centre in the region (Chi-Square = 0.0190; P = 0.8905). In 2015 the six DMTs with the highest rates were by decreasing orders: Tecfidera®, Avonex®, Gilenya®, Aubagio®, Copaxone®, and Rebif®. Half of them were recently developed orally-administered drugs. Perspectives: Complex factors may explain the interprovincial variability. Low DMT utilization rates in the most aged patients who also have the highest recourse rate to symptomatic treatments reflect the fact that the indication of disease modifying therapies do not address older patient's needs. New DMTs with medical indications for the late degenerative phase are needed."

Background: The acute and delayed effect of analgesic-range doses of ketamine on neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes is understudied. Using a non-controlled open-labelled design, three (1-h duration) increasing intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions comprising (i) 30 mg bolus of ketamine + 8 mg/h IV infusion, (ii) 12 mg/h IV infusion and (iii) 20 mg/h infusion were administered to 20 participants (15 male, 5 female, mean age = 30.8 years). Whole-blood ketamine and norketamine concentrations were determined at each treatment step and post-infusion. Methods: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was used to assess reaction/movement time (RTI, Simple and 5-Choice), visuospatial working memory (SWM), spatial planning (SOC) and subjective effects (visual analogue scale; VAS) during treatment and at post-treatment. Results: Significant main effects were reported for time (dose) on CANTAB RTI 5-Choice reaction (F(4,18) = 3.41, p = 0.029) and movement time (F(4,18) = 4.42, p = 0.011), SWM (F(4,18) = 4.19, p = 0.014) and SOC (F(4,18) = 4.13, p = 0.015), but not RTI Simple reaction or movement time. Post hoc analyses revealed dose-dependent effects for both RTI 5-Choice reaction and movement time (all p < 0.05). Post-treatment performance on all neurocognitive and behavioural tasks returned to baseline levels. Regression analyses revealed a weak positive linear association between SWM ‘strategy’ score (R² = 0.103, p < 0.001), all performance-based CANTAB VAS items (R² range 0.005–0.137, all p < 0.05) and ketamine blood concentrations. Discussion: The open-label, non-controlled trial design somewhat precludes the ability to adequately account for random treatment effects. Notwithstanding, these results suggest that analgesic doses of ketamine produce acute, selective, dose-dependent deficits in higher-order neurocognitive and behavioural domains.

"7696","0","Antidepressant mechanism of ketamine: perspective from preclinical studies.^
A debilitating mental disorder, major depressive disorder is a leading cause of global disease burden. Existing antidepressant drugs are not adequate for the majority of depressed patients, and large clinical studies have demonstrated their limited efficacy and slow response onset. Growing evidence of low-dose ketamine's rapid and potent antidepressant effects offers strong potential for future antidepressant agents. However, ketamine has considerable drawbacks such as its abuse potential, psychomimetic effects, and increased oxidative stress in the brain, thus limiting its widespread clinical use. To develop superior antidepressant drugs, it is crucial to better understand ketamine's antidepressant mechanism of action. Recent preclinical studies indicate that ketamine's antidepressant mechanism involves mammalian target of rapamycin pathway activation and subsequent synaptogenesis in the prefrontal cortex, as well as glycogen synthase kinase-3 beta (GSK-3β) inactivation. Adjunct GSK-3β inhibitors, such as lithium, can enhance ketamine's efficacy by augmenting and prolonging its antidepressant effects. Given the potential for depressive relapses, lithium in addition to ketamine is a promising solution for this clinical issue."
"4130","1","Positive psychology in the investigation of psychedelics and entactogens: A critical review.^
RATIONALE: We reviewed the concepts and empirical findings in studies with psychedelics and entactogens related to positive psychology - the study of healthy human functioning, well-being and eudaemonia. It is an unresolved question how beneficial effects of psychedelics and entactogens are related to the potential risks of these substances - particularly in non-clinical settings. METHODS: We searched in PubMed, PsychINFO and the Cochrane Library for controlled clinical and epidemiological studies which applied concepts from positive psychology. We included N = 77 eligible studies with 9876 participants published before November 1st, 2017: (1) quantitative studies (N = 54), (2) preliminary or exploratory studies and reviews not including meta-analyses (N = 17), and (3) studies evidencing primarily negative results (N = 6). RESULTS: Positive psychology concepts have been applied for measuring effects of clinical trials, recreational and ceremonial use of psychedelics and entactogens. Psychedelics and entactogens were shown to produce acute and long-term effects on mood, well-being, prosocial behaviours, empathy, cognitive flexibility, creativity, personality factors like openness, value orientations, nature-relatedness, spirituality, self-transcendence and mindfulness-related capabilities. CONCLUSIONS: There is preliminary evidence for beneficial effects of psychedelics and entactogens on measures of positive psychology in clinical and healthy populations, however their sustainability remains largely unresolved. The reported results must be considered preliminary due to methodological restrictions. Since longitudinal data on both positive and adverse effects of psychedelics are lacking, more rigorous and standardized measures from positive psychology should be applied in less biased populations with prospective longitudinal designs to carefully assess the benefit-risk-ratio.

"7338","1","Psilocybin-induced changes in cerebral blood flow are associated with acute and baseline inter-individual differences.^
Research into the use of psilocybin for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is a growing field. Nevertheless, robust brain-behavior relationships linking psilocybin-induced brain changes to subjective drug-induced effects have not been established. Furthermore, it is unclear if the acute neural effects are dependent on individual heterogeneity in baseline characteristics. To address this, we assessed the effects of three oral doses of psilocybin vs. placebo on cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling in healthy participants (N = 70; n = 31, 0.16 mg/kg; n = 10, 0.2 mg/kg; n = 29, 0.215 mg/kg). First, we quantified psilocybin-induced changes in relative and absolute CBF. Second, in an exploratory analysis, we assessed whether individual baseline characteristics and subjective psychedelic experience are associated with changes in CBF. Psychological and neurobiological baseline characteristics correlated with the psilocybin-induced reduction in relative CBF and the psilocybin-induced subjective experience. Furthermore, the psilocybin-induced subjective experience was associated with acute changes in relative and absolute CBF. The results demonstrated that inter-individual heterogeneity in the neural response to psilocybin is associated with baseline characteristics and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the psychedelic-induced altered state. Overall, these findings help guide the search for biomarkers, paving the way for a personalized medicine approach within the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy."
"6236","1","5-HT2A Agonist Psilocybin in the Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder.^
This is a multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized clinical trial of the 5‐HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin for smoking cessation. The investigators previously conducted an open‐label pilot trial (N = 15) of psilocybin paired with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Data showed a biologically‐verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence rate of 67% at 12 months and 60% at 2.5 years (continuous abstinence rates: 53% and 47%, respectively). The investigators are now conducting an open‐label randomized comparative efficacy trial of psilocybin vs. nicotine patch, both in combination with CBT. Interim results (N = 44; 22 per group) show greater biologically‐verified abstinence rates at 12 months for psilocybin: 7‐day point‐prevalence: 59% vs. 27%; continuous abstinence: 36% vs. 9%. Despite these promising findings, the investigators have yet to conduct a double‐blind study of psilocybin for smoking cessation. Furthermore, previous psilocybin study samples have been largely White with higher socioeconomic status (SES). The current trial will address these issues across three sites with experience in conducting psilocybin research: Johns Hopkins, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and New York University (NYU). A diverse sample with regard to ethno‐racial identity and SES will be recruited at each site. The proposed double‐blind study will treat 66 participants (22 at each site), randomized to receive either: 1) psilocybin; 20 mg/70 in session 1 and 30 mg/70 kg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart; or 2) niacin; 250 mg in session 1 and 375 mg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart. Niacin was selected because it has been used as an active placebo in two previous randomized therapeutic trials of psilocybin, and the FDA has informed the investigators that niacin is the FDA's preferred active placebo for psilocybin. CBT will be administered to both groups and will allow the investigators to test psilocybin's efficacy above and beyond an established treatment approach. Biochemically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence will be assessed throughout for up to 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin (compared to niacin) will cause increased biologically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐month follow‐up. Based on pilot data, the investigators will test cognitive/psychological mediators of treatment response. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin will be associated with improved cognitive control and decreased anticipation of withdrawal relief (from smoking) 1 day after the target quit date, which will be associated with greater 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐ month follow‐up. This trial will provide a rigorous test of efficacy in a diverse study sample, and test relevant mechanisms, for an innovative smoking cessation treatment showing potential for substantial efficacy."
"4639","1","Acute dose of MDMA (75 mg) impairs spatial memory for location but leaves contextual processing of visuospatial information unaffected.^
RATIONALE: Research concerning spatial memory in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users has presented conflicting results showing either the presence or absence of spatial memory deficits. Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. They were treated with placebo, MDMA 75 mg, and methylphenidate 20 mg. Memory tests were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h (intoxication phase) and between 25.5 and 26 h (withdrawal phase) post-dosing. Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA. Methylphenidate did not affect performance on any of the tasks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a single dose of MDMA impairs spatial memory for location but leaves processing of contextual information intact."
"787","0","In vivo effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its deuterated form in rodents: Drug discrimination and thermoregulation.^
Background: Recent clinical studies support the use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct treatment for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Despite these promising findings, MDMA administration in controlled settings can increase blood pressure, heart rate, and body temperature. Previous studies indicate thatO-demethylated metabolites of MDMA contribute to its adverse effects. As such, limiting the conversion of MDMA to reactive metabolites may mitigate some of its adverse effects and potentially improve its safety profile for therapeutic use. Methods: We compared the interoceptive and hyperthermic effects of a deuterium-substituted form of MDMA (d2-MDMA) to MDMA using rodent drug discrimination and biotelemetry procedures, respectively. Results: Compared to MDMA, d2-MDMA produced full substitution for a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA training stimulus with equal potency and effectiveness in the drug discrimination experiment. In addition, d2-MDMA produced increases in body temperature that were shorter-lasting and of lower magnitude compared to equivalent doses of MDMA. Last, d2-MDMA and MDMA were equally effective in reversing the hypothermic effects of the selective 5-HT2A/2C antagonist ketanserin. Conclusion: These findings indicate that deuterium substitution of hydrogen at the methylenedioxy ring moiety does not impact MDMA’s interoceptive effects, and compared to MDMA, d2-MDMA has less potential for producing hyperthermic effects and likely has similar pharmacodynamic properties. Given that d2-MDMA produces less adverse effects than MDMA, but retains similar desirable effects that are thought to relate to the effective treatment of PTSD, additional investigations into its effects on cardiovascular functioning and pharmacokinetic properties are warranted.

"3336","1","Residual neuropsychological effects of illicit 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in individuals with minimal exposure to other drugs.^
Background: A substantial literature suggests that users of illicit 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") display residual cognitive deficits. Most MDMA users, however, use other illicit drugs as well, so it is difficult to be certain that these deficits are due to MDMA, as opposed to other drug use or additional confounding factors. Methods: We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 23 young MDMA users who reported minimal exposure to any other drugs, including alcohol, and to 16 comparison individuals equally involved with the rave subculture, but reporting no MDMA use. We compared the groups by regression analyses adjusting for numerous potentially confounding variables. To test for a possible dose-response effect, we also performed a median split of 12 moderate MDMA users (22-50 lifetime uses) and 11 heavy users (60-450 uses), and compared these subgroups with non-users. Results: MDMA users as a whole performed worse than non-users on most test measures, but these comparisons rarely reached statistical significance. This picture changed markedly in the subgroup analysis: although moderate users displayed virtually no differences from non-users on any measures, the heavy users displayed significant deficits on many measures, particularly those associated with mental processing speed and impulsivity. These differences did not appear explainable by differences in family-of-origin variables, verbal IQ, levels of depression, or time since last MDMA use. Conclusions: The presence of residual cognitive deficits, even among unusually ""pure"" frequent users of illicit MDMA, analyzed with adjustment for confounding variables, augments the evidence that MDMA itself, rather than some associated factor, is responsible for the deficits observed. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"2169","0","A cross-sectional survey on cannabis: Characterizing motives, opinions, and subjective experiences associated with the use of various oral cannabis products.^
BACKGROUND: Cannabis-infused products available for oral consumption include food and drink items (i.e., edibles) (e.g., baked goods, gummy-, chocolate-, and hard-candies, beverages/drinks) as well as non-food formulations (e.g., oils/tinctures, pills/capsules). This study characterized the motives, opinions, and subjective experiences associated with the use of these seven subtypes of oral cannabis products. METHODS: This web-based survey collected cross-sectional, self-report data from a convenience sample of 370 adults regarding various use-motives, self-reported cannabinoid content, subjective experiences, and opinions related to ingesting oral cannabis products with alcohol and/or food. Advice participants had received about modifying oral cannabis product effects, in general, was also collected. RESULTS: Participants reported consuming cannabis baked goods and gummy candies most frequently over the past year (68% and 63%, respectively). Participants were less likely to use oils/tinctures for enjoyment/desire relative to other product types and more likely to use oils/tinctures for therapeutic purposes (e.g., medication-replacement). Self-reported cannabinoid content was highly variable across participants and within product subtype. Participants reported feeling stronger and longer-lasting effects when consuming oral cannabis products on an empty stomach and 43% received advice to ""eat a snack or meal"" to mitigate effects that are too strong, which contrasts with controlled studies. Finally, 43% of participants reported modifying their experiences with alcohol at least some of time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to further evaluate use-motives as well as the interaction between dietary factors, cannabinoid pharmacokinetics, and subjective drug effects and the interactive effects of oral cannabis products and alcohol in a controlled laboratory setting."
"8809","1","Acute, sub-acute and long-term subjective consequences of 'ecstasy' (MDMA) consumption in 430 regular users.^
This study examined the reported psychological effects of different patterns of MDMA use in men and women, and how they are modified by use of other psychoactive substances. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 466 regular MDMA users, exploring the perceived acute, sub-acute and long-term subjective effects of this drug. Factor analysis established three main categories of acute effects of MDMA: (i) positive and (ii) negative effects on mental health, and (iii) physical effects. In terms of subacute effects, 83% of participants reported experiencing low mood and 80% reported impaired concentration between ecstasy-taking sessions. Factors affecting these effects included age, gender, extent of MDMA use and concomitant use of cocaine or amphetamine. The long-term effects most frequently reported included the development of tolerance to MDMA (59%), impaired ability to concentrate (38%), depression (37%) and 'feeling more open towards people' (31%). In terms of what might persuade users to stop using MDMA, their most prominent concern was the drug's longterm effects on mental health. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"1666","0","A Dose of Creativity: An Integrative Review of the Effects of Serotonergic Psychedelics on Creativity.^
This integrative review was conducted to summarize the knowledge pertaining to the effects that serotonergic psychedelics can have on creativity, a multi-dimensional construct referring to the ability to produce original and valuable artifacts. Psychedelics, which have long been hailed as substances that can enhance the creative process in their users, have experienced a recent resurgence in research, allowing the opportunity to better understand this relationship. To this end, I reviewed literature which attempted to study the effects of serotonergic psychedelics on creativity through psychometric methods. A total of eleven studies were reviewed, with four psychedelic compounds represented. Every study assessed components and subcomponents of divergent and convergent thinking, with only one instance of product assessment. Results suggest that convergent thinking may increase during the post-acute phases of the drugs' intake, fostering the capacity for development of previously generated ideas. However, this evidence may be circumstantial based on the low number of studies available, small sample sizes, overall lack of randomized controlled trials, and significant methodological limitations throughout most studies. Potential mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, along with the current state of the research and implications for future studies."
"6007","1","Does a Single Intravenous Dose of Ketamine Reduce the Need for Supplemental Opioids in Post-Cesarean Section Patients?.^
Eligible women for elective cesarean section admitted to the Labor and Delivery Unit of Prentice Women's Hospital will be approached for study participation immediately after the routine preanesthetic evaluation. This occurs shortly after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit. Women who agree to participate will give written, informed consent at this time. Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with intravenous (IV) access, aspiration prophylaxis and intraoperative monitoring. Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic medications will be used as per usual practice after delivery. The anesthesiologist will perform a spinal anesthetic per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3‐4 interspace (± one vertebral interspace). The spinal anesthetic will consist of 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 μg fentanyl + 150 μg of morphine. The subject will be placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression. Cesarean section will commence after adequate anesthesia is assured to a T4 sensory level to pinprick. Vasopressors and IV fluids will be administered at the anesthesiologist's discretion per usual practice. At the time of delivery, subjects will be randomized to one of two groups using a computer generated random number table. Randomization will be blocked based on whether the cesarean procedure is a primary or a repeat procedure. Randomization assignments will be kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened by a research nurse who will prepare a 20 mL syringe labeled ""study drug"". The syringe will be given to the anesthesiologist blinded to the treatment group who will subsequently administer the study drug. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive ketamine 10 mg (ketamine 10 mg/mL) diluted to 20 mL with 0.9% preservative free saline. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive 20 mL preservative free saline. The study drug will be administered into the intravenous line via an infusion pump over 10 minutes. Five minutes after placebo or drug administration, the anesthesiologist will ask the subject if she has nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Nausea and pruritus will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe; and vomiting as present or absent. Any spontaneous complaints of psychedelic effects will be noted at this time. Sedation will be assessed via the Richmond agitation‐sedation scale (RASS [see Appendix 1]). Upon completion of the cesarean section, the subject will be transported to the post anesthesia recovery unit. Patients will receive ketorolac 30 mg every 6 hours time 4 doses beginning shortly after admission to the PACU. At 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and at 24 h after administration of the study drug, the subject's pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale for pain NRS 0‐10 (see Appendix 2). Patients may request rescue analgesia if they are experiencing discomfort. The time of first rescue analgesia request will be noted, and the NRS will be determined at the time of request for rescue analgesia. Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per os. An additional dose of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg will be provided after 1 hour if the pain is not relieved to the subject's satisfaction. These are routine oral analgesic medications for postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia. Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and respiratory rate, and treatment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression). The total amount of rescue medication will be determined for each subject after 24, 48 and 72 hours. The presence of nausea, vomiting, and pruritus will be assessed at the same time intervals as the NRS for pain: 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and 24 h after IV infusion of ketamine or placebo. The subjective psychedelic effects of ketamine and morphine will be assessed using a set of true/false questions from the LSD and morphine short form of the Addiction Research Center In entory, ARCI (Appendix 3). These questions will be administered verbally by the anesthesiologist or researcher blinded to the treatment group upon admission to the PACU and at 4 h. The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and secondary outcome data: maternal age, height, weight, prepregnancy weight, gestational age and IV fluids administered during cesarean section. In addition, all intraoperative and postoperative medications will be recorded, including those administered for the treatment of side effects listed above. Protocol specific analgesia assessment ends 24 hours after administration of the study drug. At 72 hours the subject will be asked about her satisfaction with postoperative analgesia (100 mm scale, 0 mm = not satisfied at all, 100 mm = very satisfied). One telephone follow‐up evaluation 2 weeks after delivery will again, assess for satisfaction with analgesia and average pain (NRS) since the procedure."
"7369","1","Neural mechanisms underlying ecstasy-related attentional bias.^
Conditioned responses to cues associated with drug taking play a pivotal role in a number of theories of drug addiction. This study examined whether attentional biases towards drug-related cues exist in recreational drug users who predominantly used ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). Experiment 1 compared 30 ecstasy users, 25 cannabis users, and 30 controls in an attentional distraction task in which neutral, evocative, and ecstasy-related pictures were presented within a coloured border, requiring participants to respond as quickly as possible to the border colour. Experiment 2 employed functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and the attentional distraction task and tested 20 ecstasy users and 20 controls. Experiment 1 revealed significant response speed interference by the ecstasy-related pictures in the ecstasy users only. Experiment 2 revealed increased prefrontal and occipital activity in ecstasy users in all conditions. Activations in response to the ecstasy stimuli in these regions showed an apparent antagonism whereby ecstasy users, relative to controls, showed increased occipital but decreased right prefrontal activation. These results are interpreted to reflect increased visual processing of, and decreased prefrontal control over, the irrelevant but salient ecstasy-related stimuli. These results suggest that right inferior frontal cortex may play an important role in controlling drug-related attentional biases and may thus play an important role in mediating control over drug usage. © 2013 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."

"452","0","Developments in the field of antidepressants, where do we go now?.^
Major depression is a severe psychiatric syndrome with very high prevalence and socio-economic impact. Its pathophysiology is poorly known, yet several neurotransmitter systems and brain areas have been implicated. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are most used antidepressant treatments. However, these drugs show slow onset of action and limited efficacy, making necessary the use of drug augmentation strategies or more aggressive interventions. Two important observations have emerged in recent years indicating that more rapid and effective antidepressant treatments are possible. Hence, the deep brain stimulation (DBS) of ventral anterior (subgenual) cingulate cortex (Cg25) evokes rapid mood improvements in subgroups of treatment-resistant depressive patients, likely mediated by a functional remodelling of cortico-limbic circuits. On the other hand, the noncompetitive NDMA receptor antagonist ketamine can also evoke rapid (e.g., 2 h) and persistent (up to 1 wk) improvements in some treatment-resistant patients. Moreover, recent preclinical observations indicate the antidepressant capacity of mGluR agents. Overall, this supports the usefulness of glutamatergic transmission as a new area in antidepressant drug development. On the monoamine side, new preclinical and clinical research should clarify the different roles played by 5-HT receptors in depression as well as the brain areas and circuits responsible for therapeutic improvement. This will lead to the synthesis of new agents blocking the serotonin (and possibly norepinephrine) transporter which will also activate or block 5-HT receptors playing respectively positive (e.g., postsynaptic 5-HT1A, 5-HT4) or negative (e.g., presynaptic 5-HT1A,/(1B), 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C,5-HT3, etc.) roles in antidepressant effects.

"4351","0","Long-term neuronal damage and recovery after a single dose of MDMA: Expression and distribution of serotonin transporter in the rat brain.^
""Ecstasy"", 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), an amphetamine analogue is one of the most widely used recreational drugs. In spite of the fact that neurotoxic effects of MDMA has been found in several species from rodents to non-human primates, and results increasingly point to damage also in human MDMA users, data about the sensitivity of different brain areas and the recovery after neuronal damage are scarce. Serotonin transporter (5-HTT) mRNA in the raphe nuclei also has not been examined. Humans with genetic predisposition for the slow metabolism of MDMA, the so-called ""poor metabolizers"" of debrisoquin are at higher risk. Five- 9% of the Caucasian population is considered to carry this phenotype. These studies were carried out in Dark Agouti rats, a special strain that show decreased microsomal CYP2D1 isoenzyme activity, and thus may serve as a model of vulnerable human users. These works were designed to characterize MDMA-induced damage and recovery of the serotonergic system including sleep and morphological changes within 180 days. In our experiments we investigated the 5-HTT mRNA expression in the brainstem and medullary raphe nuclei, 5-HTT immunoreactive (IR) fibre densities in several brain areas, and 16 functional measures of sleep in response to a single dose of +/- MDMA (15mg\kg). Furthermore, behavioural experiments were performed 21 days after MDMA treatment. We found similar changes in 5-HTT mRNA expression in the examined raphe nuclei, namely transient increases 7 days after MDMA treatment followed by transient decreases at 21 days. Significant (20-40%), widespread reductions in 5-HTT-IR fibre density were detected in most brain areas at 7 and 21 days after MDMA administration. All cortical, but only some brainstem areas were damaged. Parallel to the neuronal damage we observed significant reductions in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep latency, increased fragmentation of sleep and increases in delta power spectra in non-REM sleep. At 180 days almost all functional changes in sleep were normalized together with 5-HTT mRNA expression in the examined raphe nuclei and the recovery of 5-HTT-IR fibre density in most brain areas. Our results also suggest that the acute MDMA administration abolished aggressive behaviour but MDMA pretreatment and the consequent depletion of serotonergic terminals did not affect aggression. Our findings concerning the changes detected in 5-HTT mRNA expression and fibre density indicate lasting impairment of the serotonergic system and suggest that a single use of MDMA may be associated with long-lasting cognitive, learning, memory and mood deficits and sleep disturbances particularly when a constellation of genetic vulnerability and certain environmental factors are present. Our data provide further evidence for the connection between altered serotonergic functions and sleep disturbance."
"937","0","Analgesic potential of macrodoses and microdoses of classical psychedelics in chronic pain sufferers: a population survey.^
Although several studies and reports have shown the potential analgesic use of serotonergic psychedelics in cancer pain, phantom limb pain and cluster headache, evidence supporting their use for chronic pain is still limited. The past years have seen a considerable renewal of interest toward the therapeutic use of these compounds for mood disorders, resulting in a marked increase in the number of people turning to psychedelics in an attempt to self-medicate a health condition or improve their wellbeing. In western countries particularly, this population of users overlaps substantially with chronic pain sufferers, representing a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects these compounds have on pain and wellbeing. Here, we report results from an online survey conducted between August 2020 and July 2021 in a population of 250 chronic pain sufferers who had experience with psychedelics, either in microdoses (small sub-hallucinogenic doses), macrodoses (hallucinogenic doses), or both. Macrodoses, while less often used for analgesic purposes than microdoses, were reported to induce a higher level of pain relief than both microdoses and conventional pain medications (including opioids and cannabis). Although the effects were weaker and potentially more prone to expectation bias than with macrodoses, our results also suggested some benefits of psychedelics in microdoses for pain management. The reported analgesic effect appeared unrelated to mood improvements associated with psychedelic use, or the advocacy of psychedelic use. Taken together, our findings indicate interesting potential analgesic applications for psychedelics that warrant further clinical research."

It has been noted for several years that certain drugs produce abnormal test results in patients who are administered the electronystagmograph (ENG) test. Drug specific waveforms, termed drug evoked potentials (DEP), have been identified by using the ENG for alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, tranquilizers, amphetamines, barbiturates, opiates, hallucinogens, caffeine, aminophylline, dopamine, several gases and approximately 75 combinations of drugs (N = 821). Tests for double blind diagnosis of drug intake as well as tests for repeatability within the same subject were conducted. Subjects included surgical candidates, healthy volunteers, and neonates (N = 248). Drugs tested were ketamine hydrochloride, fentanyl, sodium pentothal, cocaine, dextroamphetamine, sodium seconal, morphine sulfate, phenobarbital, and meperidine. Placebos of dextrose in water and sucrose tablets were also used (N = 25). Analysis of the waveforms produced by surgical candidates and healthy volunteers revealed no false negatives or false positives. Analysis of waveforms produced by neonates whose mothers had been administered meperidine demonstrated a diminishing effect over the course of a 3 day period. Results of repeated studies revealed reliability within subject. One subject who was administered dextroamphetamine did not produce a wave consistent with amphetamine with a dosage of 5 mg. He did, however, produce an amphetamine wave when administered 10 mg of dextroamphetamine. These findings suggest a dose related effect, indicating the need for establishment of minimal levels of detection. Results indicate that with refinement and further research, this method could be used for identification of drugs diagnostically."
"6074","1","Geriatric Ketamine for Pain Management Study.^
Elderly patients are making up a greater proportion of the New York State population every year as the nation's overall population continues to age at a rapid pace. Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non‐opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well‐being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an ""opioid‐free"" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double‐blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub‐dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 ‐ 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non‐traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on‐duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e‐mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition on all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research manager and statistician, who will be independent of any data collection."
"7295","1","Preemptive analgesic effect of ketamine in patients undergoing elective cesarean section.^
Objectives: In this study, the preemptive effect of a small dose of ketamine on postoperative wound pain and morphine consumption in patients undergoing elective cesarean section was evaluated. Methods: In a randomized, double-blind clinical trial, 60 women with American Society of Anesthesiologists class I and II identification undergoing elective cesarean section were enrolled. In the case group, the patients received 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, and in the control group, they received isotonic saline, 5 minutes before the induction of anesthesia. Anesthesia was induced with 4 mg/kg thiopental followed by 1.5 mg/kg succinylcholine. A further neuromuscular block was achieved by using 0.2 mg/kg of atracurium. Anesthesia was maintained with nitrous oxide 50% and halothane in oxygen. The lungs were mechanically ventilated. After fetus delivery, fentanyl (2 μg/kg) and morphine (0.15 mg/kg) were given intravenously. In the postanesthesia care unit and in the ward, all patients received morphine. Pain was assessed by the Visual Analog Scales at 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively; the amount of morphine used and side effects were recorded. Results: There was no significant difference between the patients considering their operative details, homodynamic variables, side effects, and Apgar scores of their babies at first and fifth minutes. Significantly, lower amounts of morphine were used in the case group (4.8 mg ± 2.5 mg vs. 8.1 mg ± 4.2 mg) during the first 2 hours after surgery (P=0.01), but the difference was not significant during 2 to 24 hours (3.2 ± 2.2 vs. 3.1 ± 2.3). There were no statistical differences between the groups in pain 2, 6, 12, and 24 hours postoperatively. Discussion: Intraoperative low-dose ketamine had no effect on morphine consumption during 2 to 24 hours after surgery. No significant differences were seen in the pain scores of the 2 groups during the study period. The preoperative administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine in patients undergoing cesarean section did not elicit a preemptive analgesic effect.

Hispanic youth represent one of the fastest-growing minority groups. Yet, we know little about Hispanic adolescents' response to empirically-supported interventions for adolescent addiction, including motivational interviewing (MI). This randomized controlled trial (RCT) compared MI to an active educational treatment for adolescent alcohol and cannabis use (alcohol and cannabis education; ACE). Adolescents who regularly use substances (N = 448; n = 347 Hispanic; n = 101 non-Hispanic white; ages 13-18) were randomized to two 1-hr individual sessions of MI or ACE. We examined 6-month outcomes and mechanisms of change across Hispanic and non-Hispanic white youth. Treatment response was comparable across ethnicities (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white youth). Additionally, adolescents in the MI condition showed greater reductions in alcohol use compared to those in ACE, with support for motivation and self-efficacy as mechanisms of treatment response. Direct effects of MI on cannabis use were not observed; however, a significant indirect effect of motivation was observed for reductions in cannabis use. Data support the efficacy of MI in reducing adolescent alcohol use, through the vehicle of enhanced motivation and self-efficacy. While consistent treatment response was observed for adolescent alcohol use across ethnicities (Hispanic vs. non-Hispanic white), further exploration into potential underexplored mechanisms of Hispanic adolescents' treatment response is requisite to strengthening prevention and intervention programming for Hispanic adolescents' cannabis use.

"8073","1","Surveying drug consumption: Assessing reliability and validity of the European Web Survey on Drugs questionnaire.^
Background: The European Web Survey on Drugs aimed to obtain in-depth data on consumption of cannabis, ecstasy/MDMA, cocaine, and amphetamines in different populations of drug users in 16 European countries. This paper examines test-retest reliability, the consistency and the comprehensibility of the prevalence and frequency of use questions in the Czech part of the survey. Methods: A baseline web survey was performed (N = 610) with follow-up data collection in a sub-sample of volunteers providing email addresses (N = 158). The baseline sample was self-selecting, responding to advertisements made available through multiple channels designed to attract diverse samples of drug users. Test-retest analysis was conducted for core questionnaire items. Results: Respondents to the follow-up were predominantly socially integrated; 91% reported last year cannabis use, 42% used Ecstasy/MDMA, 23% amphetamines, and 27% reported cocaine use. Test-retest reliability was rated moderate to good (reliability coefficients between 0.55–0.87) for most prevalence items with sufficient sample sizes. Items assessing frequency of use were more reliable for most substances when asking about the exact number of days used, compared to categorical items that implicitly assume a regular pattern of use and were interpreted differently by different respondents. Conclusions: Simplicity and unambiguity of questions increase the reliability of results. Tools measuring drug consumption need to take into consideration the irregularity of drug using patterns. Question testing is important to increase validity and support a correct interpretation of the data."
"9528","0","An update on ketamine and its two enantiomers as rapid-acting antidepressants.^
Introduction: Depression is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide. Approximately one-third of depressed patients are treatment-resistant to the currently available antidepressants and there is a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. There is a clear unmet need for rapid-acting and more efficacious treatments. (R,S)-ketamine, an old anesthetic drug, appears now to be going through a renaissance. Areas covered: This paper reviews recent literature describing the antidepressant effects of ketamine and its enantiomer (S)-ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar disorder (BD). Furthermore, the authors discuss the therapeutic potential of (R)-ketamine, another enantiomer of (R,S)-ketamine, and (S)-norketamine. Expert commentary: A number of clinical studies have demonstrated that (R,S)-ketamine has rapid-acting and sustained antidepressant activity in treatment-resistant patients with MDD, BD, and other psychiatric disorders. Off-label use of ketamine for mood disorders is proving popular in the United States. Meanwhile, preclinical data suggests that (R)-ketamine can exert longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression, and (R)-ketamine may have less detrimental side effects than (R,S)-ketamine and (S)-ketamine. Additionally, (S)-norketamine exhibits rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, with a potency similar to that of (S)-ketamine. Unlike (S)-ketamine, (S)-norketamine does not cause behavioral and biochemical abnormalities and could be a safer than (S)-ketamine too."
"5815","1","Memory deficits associated with recreational use of 'ecstasy' (MDMA).^
Evidence from both animal, and human, studies suggests that repeated administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') produces lasting decreases in serotonergic activity. Serotonin is believed to play a modulatory role in a variety of psychological processes, including learning and memory. There are recent reports that polydrug users, who have used ecstasy recreationally, exhibit selective impairments in memory. However, these studies did not compare ecstasy users with polydrug users who had not taken ecstasy, leaving open the possibility that the memory deficits may be associated with a history of use of other illicit drugs. The present study used the Rivermead Behavioural Memory test to investigate immediate and delayed recall in: 25 polydrug-users who had taken more than 20 tablets of ecstasy (MDMA group), 22 participants (polydrug controls) who had never taken ecstasy, but, otherwise has personal characteristics (e.g. age, gender, education, height, weight), and illicit drug use histories, that were generally not significantly different from those of the MDMA group, and 19 participants who had not used illicit drugs but who also had similar personal characteristics (non-drug controls). Participants in the MDMA group recalled significantly fewer ideas (approximately 75% of the number of ideas recalled by participants in either of the other two groups), in both immediate and delayed recall conditions. The two illicit drug-using groups did differ in their estimated IQ scores and their duration of use of LSD, but only the latter proved to be a statistically significant covariate, and the difference in recall performance between the MDMA and polydrug controls groups remained statistically significant when this variable was treated as a covariate. The present findings provide the first evidence that deficits in memory performance in recreational ecstasy users are primarily associated with past exposure to ecstasy, rather than with the other legal and illicit drugs consumed by these individuals, and are consistent with reduced serotonergic modulation of mnemonic function as a result of long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA in humans."
"9045","1","First use of ecstasy and psychological well-being.^
Introduction: The use of the synthetic drug ecstasy has rapidly spread throughout the EU countries. In Germany, almost one in 25 juveniles aged between 12 and 25 years has used ecstasy, with use starting at an ever younger age. Method: The relationship between psychopathology (depression, anxiety and aggressiveness) and age of first use and intensity of use was examined in 84 ecstasy and 29 cannabis users. Results: An earlier onset of ecstasy use was related to a significantly greater severity of psychological symptoms. Conclusions: This outcome could be the consequence of neurotoxicity due to ecstasy use, or psychosocial disturbance could result in ecstasy use at an early age."
"8342","1","Prediction of psilocybin response in healthy volunteers.^
Responses to hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin, are believed to be critically dependent on the user's personality, current mood state, drug pre-experiences, expectancies, and social and environmental variables. However, little is known about the order of importance of these variables and their effect sizes in comparison to drug dose. Hence, this study investigated the effects of 24 predictor variables, including age, sex, education, personality traits, drug pre-experience, mental state before drug intake, experimental setting, and drug dose on the acute response to psilocybin. The analysis was based on the pooled data of 23 controlled experimental studies involving 409 psilocybin administrations to 261 healthy volunteers. Multiple linear mixed effects models were fitted for each of 15 response variables. Although drug dose was clearly the most important predictor for all measured response variables, several non-pharmacological variables significantly contributed to the effects of psilocybin. Specifically, having a high score in the personality trait of Absorption, being in an emotionally excitable and active state immediately before drug intake, and having experienced few psychological problems in past weeks were most strongly associated with pleasant and mystical-type experiences, whereas high Emotional Excitability, low age, and an experimental setting involving positron emission tomography most strongly predicted unpleasant and/or anxious reactions to psilocybin. The results confirm that non-pharmacological variables play an important role in the effects of psilocybin."

This study explores the utility of a self-completion survey method to quickly and cheaply generate information on patterns and trends among regular 'recreational' drug consumers. Data is reported here from 1151 subjects accessed through a dance music publication. In keeping with previous studies of drug use within the dance scene polysubstance use was the norm. Many of those reporting use of 'ecstasy' were regularly using multiple tablets often consumed in combination with other substances thus exposing themselves to serious health risks, in particular the risk of dose related neurotoxic effects. Seventy percent were drinking alcohol at hazardous levels. Subjects' patterns of drug purchasing also put them at risk of severe criminal sanction. Data supported evidence that cocaine use had become increasing popular in the UK, but contrasted with some commentators' views that ecstasy use was in decline. The utility of this method and how the results should be interpreted is discussed, as are the data's implications for harm and risk reduction activities. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ireland Ltd.

"6968","0","Group II mGlu receptor antagonist LY341495 enhances the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine in the forced swim test in rats.^
Rationale: Numerous preclinical and clinical studies have reported the rapid and sustained antidepressant effects of the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. Because ketamine induces several undesirable and dangerous effects, a variety of strategies have been suggested to avoid such effects. Objectives: Here, we propose to enhance the sub-effective doses of ketamine by co-administration with the group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptor antagonist LY341495. This compound potentially acts as an antidepressant via a mechanism similar to that of ketamine. Methods: To investigate the rapid and sustained antidepressant-like effects of these drugs, we administered ketamine and LY341495 individually or in combination, 40 min and 24 h before the forced swim test (FST). Results: We found that sub-effective doses of ketamine and LY341495, given jointly, induce significant antidepressant-like effects, at both 40 min and 24 h after administration. The results obtained using Western blot technique indicate that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway activation may be involved in the mechanism of this action. The effects of drugs, used at identical ranges of times and doses, on spontaneous locomotor activity in rats were excluded. Furthermore, the results obtained from the rota-rod test and the ketamine-induced hyperlocomotion test suggest a lack of potentially adverse effects from the combined administration of ketamine and LY341495 at doses previously used in the FST. Conclusion: Altogether, these data suggest that the joint administration of ketamine and LY341495 might be a noteworthy alternative to the use of solely ketamine in the therapy of depression.

"9396","0","Preliminary Results on the Long-Term Effects of Dextromethorphan on MDMA-Mediated Serotonergic Deficiency and Volumetric Changes in Primates Based on 4-[(18)F]-ADAM PET/MRI.^
Alterations to the serotonergic system due to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) (ecstasy) consumption have been extensively documented. However, knowledge of the reversibility of these neurotoxic effects based on in vivo evaluations of serotonin transport (SERT) availability remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurotoxicity of MDMA after 66 months abstinence and explored whether Dextromethorphan, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, could attenuate MDMA-induced neurotoxicity using 4-[(18)F]-ADAM, an imaging ligand that selectively targets SERT, with positron emission tomography technology (PET). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were used in this study: control, MDMA, and DM + MDMA. Static 4-[(18)F]-ADAM PET was performed at 60 and 66 months after drug treatment. Serotonin transport (SERT) availability was presented as the specific uptake ratios (SURs) of 4-[(18)F]-ADAM in brain regions. Voxel-based region-specific SERT availability was calculated to generate 3D PET/MR images. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetric analysis was also conducted at 60 months. Significantly decreased 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs were observed in the striatum and thalamus of the MDMA group at 60 and 66 months compared to controls; the midbrain and frontal cortex SURs were similar at 60 and 66 months in the MDMA and control groups. All eleven brain regions showed significantly lower (∼13%) self-recovery rates over time; the occipital cortex and cingulate recovered to baseline by 66 months. DM attenuated MDMA-induced SERT deficiency on average, by ∼8 and ∼1% at 60 and 66 months, respectively; whereas significant differences were observed between the thalamus and amygdala of the MDMA and DM + MDMA groups at 66 months. Compared to controls, the MDMA group exhibited significantly increased (∼6.6%) gray matter volumes in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, midbrain, and amygdala. Moreover, the gray matter volumes of the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala correlated negatively with the 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs of the same regions. DM (n = 2) did not appear to affect MDMA-induced volumetric changes. The 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs, lower self-recovery rate and increased volumetric values indicate the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala still exhibit MDMA-induced neurotoxicity after 66 months' abstinence. Moreover, DM may prevent MDMA-induced serotonergic deficiency, as indicated by increased 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs and SERT availability, but not volumetric changes."
"5914","1","Ketamine for the rapid treatment of suicidal ideation: new findings from a randomized controlled trial.^
Background: Suicide is a devastating public health problem and very few biological treatments have been found to be effective in decreasing the intensity of suicidal ideation (SI) or the risk of suicide. We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment resistant depression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients who presented with clinically significant SI across a trans‐diagnostic sample (n=24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. Suicidal ideation measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 hours post‐treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary analyses included the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale‐Suicidal Ideation (MADRS‐SI) score at 24 hours and additional measures beyond the 24‐hour time point. Results: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7‐day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 hours (p=0.32), however a significant difference emerged at 48 hours (p=0.047). MADRS‐SI score was lower in the ketamine compared to midazolam group at 24 hours (p=0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7‐day assessment period. Conclusions: The current findings provide support for the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ketamine as an intervention for suicidal ideation in patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior across mood and anxiety disorders."
"3389","1","Subjective and hormonal effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans.^
RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used phenethylamine. Reports have described the effects of MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting, but the full range of effects of MDMA in humans is still not completely characterized. OBJECTIVES: To describe the physiological, subjective, and hormonal changes after single doses of MDMA in a laboratory setting and examine relationships between these effects. METHODS: Eight MDMA-experienced volunteers each received placebo, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg oral doses of MDMA in a double-blind crossover study. RESULTS: The 1.5 mg/kg dose (comparable to that typically used by most participants) produced significant subjective effects, peaking at about 2 h after dosing, including some effects commonly associated with stimulant drugs, hallucinogens, and entactogens. MDMA significantly increased plasma cortisol, prolactin, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels. Increase in plasma cortisol after the 1.5 mg/kg dose correlated with increased heart rate, rate-pressure product, and drug liking. Rise in DHEA correlated with euphoria. CONCLUSIONS: A typically used dose of MDMA produced effects commonly associated with stimulants and hallucinogens. Subjects liked MDMA. Correlations between cortisol and DHEA levels and some physiological and psychological effects are consistent with animal data suggesting that hormones modulate some responses to drugs of abuse."

"6681","1","""Ordinary"" people with ""normal"" lives? A longitudinal study of ecstasy and other drug use among Norwegian youth.^
Ecstasy users have been described as ""ordinary people"" with ""normal lives"" in recent literature, but little empirical evidence exists to support this portrayal. One may assume, however, that such a rosy portrayal is more likely to fit individuals who consume drugs that are more commonly used (e.g., cannabis). With this in mind, we have explored characteristics of different categories of drug users by analyzing data from a general population study of young people in Norway (n = 2,761). Respondents were assessed three times over a period of seven years (mean age at time 3 = 21.6 years). Results showed that ecstasy users, cannabis users, and users of ""traditional"" hard drugs were all relatively unremarkable with respect to socio-economic characteristics. On the other hand, they all tended to have a less favorable family background than nonusers of drugs, and their rates of past and present legal substance use, mental health problems, and antisocial behavior were also much higher. Individuals who included ecstasy in their drug-taking repertoire had a somewhat more deviant profile than other drug users, indicating that their public image of being ordinary and well adjusted is highly overstated. This image did not fit ""pure"" cannabis users very well either."

The aim of this study was to investigate methylone and its metabolites concentration in oral fluid following controlled increasing doses, focusing on the effect of oral fluid pH. Samples were obtained from a clinical trial where twelve healthy volunteers participated after ingestion of 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg of methylone. Concentration of methylone and its metabolites 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy-N-methylcathinone (HMMC) and 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone in oral fluid were measured using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). Pharmacokinetic parameters were estimated, and the oral fluid-to-plasma ratio (OF/P) at each time interval was calculated and correlated with the oral fluid pH using data from our previous study in plasma. Methylone was detected at all time intervals after each dose; MDC and HMMC were not detectable after the lowest dose. Oral fluid concentrations of methylone ranged between 88.3-503.8, 85.5-5002.3, 182.8-13,201.8 and 214.6-22,684.6 ng/mL following 50, 100, 150 and 200 mg doses, respectively, peaked between 1.5 and 2.0 h, and were followed by a progressive decrease. Oral fluid pH was demonstrated to be affected by methylone administration. Oral fluid is a valid alternative to plasma for methylone determination for clinical and toxicological studies, allowing for a simple, easy and non-invasive sample collection."
"1314","1","Ketamine Anesthesia Does Not Improve Depression Scores in Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^
BACKGROUND: Although interest in ketamine use during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has increased, studies have been equivocal with regard to its efficacy. The aims of this clinical trial were to evaluate ketamine's antidepressive effects in ECT as a primary anesthetic, determine ketamine's tolerability when compared with standard anesthesia, and determine if plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary for treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults meeting criteria for treatment-resistant depression undergoing index course ECT received either methohexital (1 to 2 mg/kg) or ketamine (1 to 2 mg/kg) anesthesia in this dual-arm double-blinded randomized clinical trial (NCT02752724). The primary outcome of this study is change in depression questionnaire scores before and after ECT. Seizure data, depression severity using self-reported and clinician-assessed questionnaires, cognitive scoring, and plasma BDNF concentrations were obtained before and after completion of ECT. RESULTS: There were no differences in seizure lengths, hemodynamics, or seizure stimuli between the ketamine (n=23;138 ECTs) and methohexital (n=27;159 ECTs) groups. Depression scores improved similarly after ECT in both groups. In the methohexital group, 15% of patients failed to achieve adequate seizures and were switched to ketamine and 26% were converted to bilateral ECT stimulus, whereas all ketamine patients achieved adequate seizures and only 4% required bilateral stimulus. Plasma BDNF increased after ECT only in the ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ketamine does not significantly improve depression when compared with methohexital as a single induction agent for ECT, increases serum BDNF and does not increase rates of post-ECT agitation. Ketamine use in ECT may have some benefits for some patients that are not captured through standard depression assessment questionnaires alone."
"9193","0","Culture and psychedelic psychotherapy: Ethnic and racial themes from three Black women therapists.^
Psychedelic medicine is an emerging field of research and practice that examines the psychotherapeutic effects of substances classified as hallucinogens on the human mind, body, and spirit. Current research explores the safety and efficacy of these substances for mental health disorders including anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Although current studies explore psychotherapeutic effects from a biomedical perspective, gaps in awareness around cultural issues in the therapeutic process are prominent. African Americans have been absent from psychedelic research as both participants and researchers, and little attention has been paid to the potential of psychedelics to address traumas caused by racialization. This paper examines cultural themes and clinical applications from the one-Time use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as part of an US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-Approved clinical trial and training exercise for three African American female therapists. The primary themes that emerged across the varied experiences centered on strength, safety, connection, and managing oppression/racialization. The participants' experiences were found to be personally meaningful and instructive for how Western models of psychedelic-Assisted psychotherapy could be more effective and accessible to the Black community. Included is a discussion of the importance of facilitator training to make best use of emerging material when it includes cultural, racial, and spiritual themes. A lack of knowledge and epistemic humility can create barriers to treatment for underserved populations. Implications for future research and practice for marginalized cultural groups are also discussed, including consideration of Functional Analytic Psychotherapy (FAP) as an adjunct to the psychedelic-Therapy approaches currently advanced. As women of color are among the most stigmatized groups of people, it is essential to incorporate their perspectives into the literature to expand conversations about health equity. © 2021 Department of Health and Human Services.

A fast and selective ultra-performance liquid chromatography- tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS-MS) method for the determination of amphetamines (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, ephedrine, and p-methoxyamphetamine) in plasma has been developed and validated. Sample preparation was performed by liquid-liquid extraction using ethyl acetate. For optimized chromatographic performance with repeatable retention times, narrow and symmetrical peaks, and focusing all analytes at the column inlet, a gradient start, with acid mobile phase consisting of 0.1% formic acid and methanol was chosen. Positive electrospray ionization MS-MS detection was performed with two multiple reaction monitoring transitions for each analyte. Deuteriumlabeled internal standards were used for five of the analytes. The limit of detection was in the range 0.25-1.25 ng/mL, and the limit of quantification was fixed at the lowest calibrator of 2.5 ng/mL for all of the compounds. The RSD values of the intra- and interassay precision and accuracy were lower than 11% at four concentration levels, including two external quality controls. No or only minor matrix effects were observed, and the extraction method presented recoveries higher than 93% for all the compounds. Total run time, including equilibration, was 12 min. The method is routinely used at the National Institute of Criminalistics and Criminology for quantitative determination of the main amphetamines in plasma from forensic and driving under the influence cases."
"8800","1","Characteristics of patients expressing an interest in ketamine treatment: Results of an online survey.^
Background: Off-label ketamine treatment has shown acute antidepressant effects that offer hope for patients with therapy-resistant depression. However, its potential for integration into treatment algorithms is controversial, not least because the evidence base for maintenance treatment with repeated ketamine administration is currently weak. Ketamine is also a drug of misuse, which has raised concerns regarding the target population. Little is known about which patients would seek ketamine treatment if it were more widely available. Aims: To explore some of the characteristics of the patients actively seeking ketamine treatment. Method: An online survey containing questions about duration of current depressive episode, number of antidepressants used and other comments was completed by patients who were exploring the internet regarding the possibility of ketamine for depression. Results: Of the 1088 people who registered their interest, 93.3% reported depression, 64.3% reported a chronic course of their symptoms and in the past 10 years, 86.3% had tried at least two antidepressants. Desperation was a common theme, but this appeared to be competently expressed. A small minority (< 8%) reported experience of illegal ketamine use. Conclusions: It cannot be ruled out that patients with different degrees of treatment resistance and comorbidities will seek treatment with ketamine. This stresses the urgency to perform larger randomised controlled trials as well as to systematically monitor outcomes and adverse effects of ketamine, that is currently prescribed off-label for patients in need.

"8267","0","Comparative Untargeted Metabolomics Analysis of the Psychostimulants 3,4-Methylenedioxy-Methamphetamine (MDMA), Amphetamine, and the Novel Psychoactive Substance Mephedrone after Controlled Drug Administration to Humans.^
Psychoactive stimulants are a popular drug class which are used recreationally. Over the last decade, large numbers of new psychoactive substances (NPS) have entered the drug market and these pose a worldwide problem to human health. Metabolomics approaches are useful tools for simultaneous detection of endogenous metabolites affected by drug use. They allow identification of pathways or characteristic metabolites, which might support the understanding of pharmacological actions or act as indirect biomarkers of consumption behavior or analytical detectability. Herein, we performed a comparative metabolic profiling of three psychoactive stimulant drugs 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), amphetamine and the NPS mephedrone by liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) in order to identify common pathways or compounds. Plasma samples were obtained from controlled administration studies to humans. Various metabolites were identified as increased or decreased based on drug intake, mainly belonging to energy metabolism, steroid biosynthesis and amino acids. Linoleic acid and pregnenolone-sulfate changed similarly in response to intake of all drugs. Overall, mephedrone produced a profile more similar to that of amphetamine than MDMA in terms of affected energy metabolism. These data can provide the basis for further in-depth targeted metabolome studies on pharmacological actions and search for biomarkers of drug use."
"5584","1","Ketamine vs Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Episode: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.^
IMPORTANCE: The relative efficacy of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with major depressive episode (MDE) needs clarification. OBJECTIVE: To compare depression rating outcomes with ketamine vs ECT in adults with MDE and to compare response and remission rates, number of sessions to response and remission, and adverse effects. DATA SOURCES: Two investigators independently systematically searched MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases using a combination of relevant Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text keywords from database inception through May 15, 2022, to identify relevant English-language trials. STUDY SELECTION: Parallel-group randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. One-week posttreatment outcomes were pooled as standardized mean difference (SMD; Hedges g) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for categorical outcomes in random-effects meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy outcomes were 1-week (or nearest) posttreatment depression ratings, 1-week (or nearest) study-defined response and remission rates, and number of sessions to treatment response and remission. Safety outcomes were reported adverse effects. RESULTS: Five trials (ketamine group: n = 141; ECT group: n = 137) were meta-analyzed. The overall pooled SMD for posttreatment depression ratings was -0.39 (95% CI, -0.81 to 0.02; I2 = 45%; 5 RCTs). For this efficacy outcome, in a sensitivity analysis of methodologically stronger trials, ECT was superior to ketamine (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.14; I2 = 6%; 2 RCTs). ECT was also superior to ketamine for study-defined response (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs) and remission (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.82; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs) rates. No significant differences were noted between groups for number of sessions to response and remission and for cognitive outcomes. Key limitations were small number of studies, limited sample size, and high risk of bias in all trials. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest an efficacy advantage for ECT over ketamine in adults with MDE. These conclusions are tempered by the small number and size of existing trials."
"6364","1","Personal and family history of alcohol dependence alters antidepresant response to oral riluzole post-ketamine infusion.^
Background: Family history of alcohol dependence is a positive predictor of ketamine's antidepressant effects in unipolar and bipolar depression. As we recently suggested that the glutamatergic modulator riluzole may delay time to relapse after ketamine infusion in a 4 week trial, we investigated if a lifetime personal or family history of alcohol dependence mediated riluzole's effect. Methods: Secondary analysis of randomized, double‐blind placebo controlled trial of treatment‐resistant unipolar depression (18‐65, MADRS≥22) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and randomized to double‐blind treatment with riluzole (100‐200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. Results: Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine (p=.02). In subjects randomized to placebo, the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response (p=.002). There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole (p=.88). No antidepressant difference was observed between placebo and riluzole in subjects with no family history of alcoholism (p=.27). Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism (p=.04). Past personal history had no main effect (p=.057). Conclusions: Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history. Personal history did not emerge as a significant factor. Although this study was not specifically powered based on family history, it is unlikely that riluzole extension post‐ketamine is a useful adjunct based on personal or family history of alcoholism."

3-Methyl-methcathinone (3-MMC) is a novel, synthetic cathinone analog, recently linked to poisoning events among recreational users. The lack of pharmacological data on 3-MMC, prompted us to explore its pharmacokinetic profile as well as its effect on feeding behavior, weight gain, and serum biochemistry. 3-MMC was administered to male pigs (n=3, three months old) as a single intravenous dose (0.3 mg/kg), followed by a multiple oral dose administration (3 mg/kg) for five days and plasma and tissue concentrations determined. Concomitantly a control group consisting of two healthy male pigs received saline solution instead of 3-MMC according to the same administration schedule. 3-MMC effects on complete blood count, biochemistry, feed intake, and body weight were examined. The pigs were sacrificed and submitted to a pathological and histopathological examination. 3-MMC displayed rapid absorption with a peak concentration achieved within 5-10 min after oral ingestion and a plasma half-life of 0.8 h. The bioavailability was about 7%. 3-MMC tissue levels were below detectable levels 24 h after the last oral dosage. No treatment-related clinical signs were observed and no histopathological findings were detected. 3-MMC caused significant change in daily feed intake and weight gain over time. The animals treated with 3-MMC displayed a lower rate of increase in mean body weight. Caution needs to be practiced in terms of extrapolating the present data to human safety, due to the low sample size, low dosage, and the relatively short study duration as well as the lack of data on abuse potential of 3-MMC."

A total of 24 subjects received 250 mug delta9-THC p.o./kg body weight and 26 subjects were treated with 250 mug DMT i.m./kg. Placebo was given to 24 subjects. The effects were assessed by a questionnaire administered following the experimental conditions. Questionnaire items were combined into the following eight scales according to their content and several cirteria of the theory of mental testing: visual hallucinations (illusions), auditory hallucinations (illusions), impairment of memory and attention, depersonalization syndrome, deprealization syndrome, changes of body image, euphoric state and anxious-depressive state. The two hallucinogen groups differed significantly from placebo on all eight scales. No difference, however, between delta9-THC and DMT was significant. On the scale ""optical hallucinations (illusions)"" a tendency that DMT might have stronger effects than delta9-THC was found.

"5082","1","Neuropsychological and mood effects of ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy: a randomised controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be neuroprotective against cognitive impairment and have synergistic antidepressant effects. This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT, in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. METHODS: Fifty-one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine (0.5mg/kg) or placebo (saline) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT. Neuropsychological outcomes (measured before ECT, after six treatments, and after the final ECT treatment) and mood outcomes (measured before ECT, and weekly after every three ECT treatments) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups. The ECT-ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up, though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course. No psychomimetic effects were detected. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a clinical setting, so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled. Thiopentone doses differed slightly between groups, in order to accommodate the addition of ketamine to the anaesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ketamine did not decrease cognitive impairment in patients having ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT, but was safe and slightly improved efficacy in the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up.

"9372","1","Simultaneous quantitation of methamphetamine, ketamine, opiates and their metabolites in urine by SPE and LC-MS-MS.^
Heroin, methamphetamine and ketamine have been the most commonly abused drugs in Taiwan. The presence of these drugs and their metabolites in postmortem specimens has been routinely monitored in our laboratory mostly by gas chromatographic-mass spectrometric methods. This study aimed to evaluate a more effective approach to simultaneously quantify these analytes (i.e., amphetamine, methamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), morphine, codeine, 6-acetylmorphine, 6-acetylcodeine, ketamine and norketamine) in postmortem urine and blood specimens by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). Samples (1 mL) were extracted via solid-phase extraction, evaporated and reconstituted in the mobile phase for injection into the LC-MS-MS system. Respective deuterated analogs of these analytes were used as internal standards. Chromatographic separation was achieved by an Agilent Zorbax SB-Aq analytical column at 50°C. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed by electrospray ionization in positive-ion dynamic multiple reaction monitoring mode with optimized collision energy for respective precursor ion selected for each analyte, and the monitoring of two transition ions. Performance characteristics were assessed using drug-free samples that were fortified with 50-1,000 ng/mL of the 10 analytes. Analytical parameters evaluated and resulting data are as follows: (i) average extraction recoveries (n = 3) were better than 80%, except for MDMA (71%) and morphine (74%); (ii) inter-day and intra-day precision ranges (%CV) were 1.59-8.80% and 0.57-3.89%, respectively; (iii) calibration linearity (r2), detection limit and quantitation limit for all analytes were >0.999, 1 and 5 ng/mL, respectively; (iv) matrix effects (ion suppression) were observed for three analytes, but were satisfactorily compensated for by the deuterated internal standards adopted in the analytical protocol. This method was successfully applied to the analysis of specimens collected from unknown death cases from various district prosecutors' offices in Taiwan, and was also found helpful to understanding whether the detected opiates were derived from heroin or legal morphine/codeine-containing medications."
"785","0","The association between impulsivity and alcohol/drug use among prison inmates.^
BACKGROUND: Few studies have examined the relation between impulsivity and drug involvement with prison inmates, in spite of their heavy drug use. Among this small body of work, most studies look at clinically relevant drug dependence, rather than drug use specifically. METHOD: N=242 adult inmates (34.8% female, 52% White) with an average age of 35.58 (SD=9.19) completed a modified version of the 15-item Barratt Impulsiveness Scale (BIS) and measures assessing lifetime alcohol, opiate, benzodiazepine, cocaine, cannabis, hallucinogen, and polysubstance use. Lifetime users also reported the frequency of use for the 30days prior to incarceration. RESULTS: Impulsivity was higher among lifetime users (versus never users) of all substances other than cannabis. Thirty day drug use frequency was only related to impulsivity for opiates and alcohol. DISCUSSION: This study extends prior work, by showing that a lifetime history of non-clinical substance use is positively associated with impulsivity among prison inmates. Implications for drug interventions are considered for this population, which is characterized by high rates of substance use and elevated impulsivity."

"6141","1","The Effect of S-ketamine for Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).^
Nowadays, depression has become one of the serious mental diseases that affect human's life. With the acceleration of life pace and social pressure, the incidence of depression is increasing year‐on‐year. According to the statistics of the WHO, by 2017, there were more than 300 million people suffering from depression, accounting for 4.4% of the global population. Depression is highly related to suicide, which is an important reason for suicidal intention and attempt. It has been demonstrated that the incidence of suicide associated with major depression was as high as 15%. The main characteristic of depression is significant and lasting depression, which is caused by the decrease of monoamine transmitters (including dopamine, 5‐HT, et al.) related to mood. In the past, antidepressants mainly relied on increasing or reducing the metabolism of transmitters, but these drugs usually took weeks or even months to take effect, and although the symptoms of depression were relieved within weeks after the start of treatment, they were still not ideal in the long term. Therefore, the drug treatment of depression is not optimistic. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as the first biological therapy introduced into psychiatry, has been improving with the progress of technology and equipment. More studies show that ECT is a safe and effective treatment, and the treatment of severe depression is the first choice in some cases. However, cognitive dysfunction, relapse tendency and related safety after ECT need further study. Short acting sedatives and muscle relaxants before ECT can minimize the fear and muscle pain caused by ECT induced seizures. Previous sedatives used include propofol, mesaclopidol, thiopental and ketamine. Ketamine can be used for ECT anesthesia in patients with depression because of its good epileptic characteristics and prevention of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. More evidences reveal ketamine has strong antidepressant effect and reduces suicide of patients with treatment‐resistant depression or mania. The low dose of ketamine can take effect within one hour, produce rapid antidepressant effect, and can play a role in more than 70% of patients with refractory depression. In addition, even a single intravenous injection of ketamine can effectively reduce the symptoms of depression within 24‐72 hours, and may have synergistic antidepressant effect when combined with ECT. Although ketamine is considered to have a significant antidepressant effect in patients with depression, its application in mental disorders remains to be further explored because it may aggravate mental symptoms. However, some studies also found that ketamine did not significantly improve the effect of ECT on depression compared with other anesthetics. Esketamine is the isomer of ketamine, which mainly acts on NMDA receptor of glutamate and its affinity to the receptor is 3‐4 times that of ketamine, therefore it has stronger effect. Evidence suggests that esketamine can regulate NMDA receptor, increase the release of various neurotransmitters, improve the depression of patients, and repair the damaged neurons to improve the neuronal connections in the brain. As an anesthetic, the potency of esketamine is two times higher than ketamine, three times higher than R‐ketamine, and its drug metabolism time is shorter, and the related side effects are also significantly reduced. Conseuqently, it has been widely used as an anesthetic in some countries. The efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray as a rapid and effective antidepressant in the treatment of patients with refractory depression have been confirmed. However the effect of intravenous esketamine as an anesthetic in ECT anesthesia on patients who are depressed remains unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short‐term effect and safety of esketamine as a adjunctive anesthetic in routine ECT anesthesia for patients with depression."
"2800","1","Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^
Objectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados."
"8177","1","Clinical and neurophysiological biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effect in major depressive disorder patients.^
Background: Ketamine, a non‐competitive antagonist of NMDA (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate) receptors, produce a unique rapid antidepressant‐like effect [1] but its influence on theta cordance is still unknown. A series of clinical studies demonstrated that QEEG prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after one week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and precedes clinical improvement [2]. To date wasn't studied predictive value of cordance in response to single infusion of ketamine in depressive subjects. We hypothesized in our study that the changes in prefrontal cordance 24 hours after the infusion will predict sustained antidepressant response fourth day after the infusion. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Methods: In a double‐blind, cross‐over, randomized, placebocontrolled experiment we studied the influence of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) on theta cordance in a group of 27 right‐handed hospitalized depressive patients on stable antidepressant medication. Antidepressant response was defined as 50% decrease of depressive symptoms evaluated fourth and seventh day after infusion by means of Montgomery‐Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). Psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale before and after the infusion [3]. Three EEG segments obtained before, after the infusion and 24 hours after the dosing were entered into spectral analyses. QEEG cordance values in theta frequency band were calculated according to UCLA algorithm from three prefrontal electrodes (Fz, Fp1, Fp2). Results: Responders (n = 11) to ketamine in compare to nonresponders (n = 16) showed significant difference in cordance values at the end of ketamine infusion (Spearman, p = 0.039). The cordance decrease, measured between the end of infusion and next day, positively correlated with ketamine antidepressant response (MADRS decrease) fourth day after infusion (twotailed Fisher's Exact test, df = 1, p = 0.0076) with NPV 90.9% (95% CI 64.3‐99.5%) and PPV 62.5% (95% CI 44.2‐68.4%). Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor‐ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. Conclusions: The reduction in theta prefrontal cordance could serve as a marker of ketamine's sustained antidepressant response, a hypothesis that should be tested in larger depressive population. The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. Our data indicate that ketamine (glutamatergic‐based drug) infusion immediately induces similar changes as monoaminergic‐based antidepressants do gradually after a series of downstream signalling steps."

Recent reports on the effects of psychedelic-assisted therapies for mood disorders and addiction, as well as the effects of psychedelics in the treatment of cluster headache, have demonstrated promising therapeutic results. In addition, the beneficial effects appear to persist well after limited exposure to the drugs, making them particularly appealing as treatments for chronic neuropsychiatric and headache disorders. Understanding the basis of the long-lasting effects, however, will be critical for the continued use and development of this drug class. Several mechanisms, including biological and psychological ones, have been suggested to explain the long-lasting effects of psychedelics. Actions on the neuroendocrine system are some such mechanisms that warrant further investigation in the study of persisting psychedelic effects. In this report, we review certain structural and functional neuroendocrinological pathologies associated with neuropsychiatric disorders and cluster headache. We then review the effects that psychedelic drugs have on those systems and provide preliminary support for potential long-term effects. The circadian biology of cluster headache is of particular relevance in this area. We also discuss methodologic considerations for future investigations of neuroendocrine system involvement in the therapeutic benefits of psychedelic drugs."

This study evaluated hair samples from 28 subjects who tested positive for ketamine at Seoul Institute National Forensic Service in Korea between 2016 and 2017. Ketamine in the hair was extracted using a solution of 1% hydrochloric acid in methanol for 16 h. Extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The LC-MS-MS method was validated by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, intra- and inter-accuracy, precision and matrix effect. In 59 ketamine-positive hair or hair segments from 28 ketamine abusers, the ketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.011-335.8 ng/mg (mean, 13.6; median, 1.8), and the norketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.001-35.7 ng/mg (mean, 7.5; median, 0.44). The ratio of norketamine to ketamine concentrations in hair was in the range of 0.01-1.46 (mean, 0.34; median, 0.26). The distribution of ketamine concentration in hair samples was as follows: 0.01-0.1 ng/mg in 11 samples (18.6%), 0.1-5 ng/mg in 33 samples (55.9%), 5-10 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 10-15 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 15-20 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 40-45 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 45-50 ng/mg in 1 sample (1.7%) and >100 ng/mg in only 2 samples (3.4%). In the hair of ketamine abusers, 26 of 28 subjects were detected simultaneously ketamine with other drugs, including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; n = 9), methamphetamine (MA; n = 3), MDMA/MA (n = 3), MDMA/para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA; n = 3), MDMA/PMA/MA (n = 2), cocaine (n = 1) and other drugs (n = 5, propofol, zolpidem or benzodiazepines).

In conclusion, most of the ketamine abusers (92.9%) were polydrug abusers, who were concomitantly abusing other controlled substances."
"6368","0","Understanding and predicting suicidality using a combined genomic and clinical risk assessment approach.^
Worldwide, one person dies every 40 seconds by suicide, a potentially preventable tragedy. A limiting step in our ability to intervene is the lack of objective, reliable predictors. We have previously provided proof of principle for the use of blood gene expression biomarkers to predict future hospitalizations due to suicidality, in male bipolar disorder participants. We now generalize the discovery, prioritization, validation, and testing of such markers across major psychiatric disorders (bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, schizoaffective disorder, and schizophrenia) in male participants, to understand commonalities and differences. We used a powerful within-participant discovery approach to identify genes that change in expression between no suicidal ideation and high suicidal ideation states (n=37 participants out of a cohort of 217 psychiatric participants followed longitudinally). We then used a convergent functional genomics (CFG) approach with existing prior evidence in the field to prioritize the candidate biomarkers identified in the discovery step. Next, we validated the top biomarkers from the prioritization step for relevance to suicidal behavior, in a demographically matched cohort of suicide completers from the coroner's office (n=26). The biomarkers for suicidal ideation only are enriched for genes involved in neuronal connectivity and schizophrenia, the biomarkers also validated for suicidal behavior are enriched for genes involved in neuronal activity and mood. The 76 biomarkers that survived Bonferroni correction after validation for suicidal behavior map to biological pathways involved in immune and inflammatory response, mTOR signaling and growth factor regulation. mTOR signaling is necessary for the effects of the rapid-acting antidepressant agent ketamine, providing a novel biological rationale for its possible use in treating acute suicidality. Similarly, MAOB, a target of antidepressant inhibitors, was one of the increased biomarkers for suicidality. We also identified other potential therapeutic targets or biomarkers for drugs known to mitigate suicidality, such as omega-3 fatty acids, lithium and clozapine. Overall, 14% of the top candidate biomarkers also had evidence for involvement in psychological stress response, and 19% for involvement in programmed cell death/cellular suicide (apoptosis). It may be that in the face of adversity (stress), death mechanisms are turned on at a cellular (apoptosis) and organismal level. Finally, we tested the top increased and decreased biomarkers from the discovery for suicidal ideation (CADM1, CLIP4, DTNA, KIF2C), prioritization with CFG for prior evidence (SAT1, SKA2, SLC4A4), and validation for behavior in suicide completers (IL6, MBP, JUN, KLHDC3) steps in a completely independent test cohort of psychiatric participants for prediction of suicidal ideation (n=108), and in a future follow-up cohort of psychiatric participants (n=157) for prediction of psychiatric hospitalizations due to suicidality. The best individual biomarker across psychiatric diagnoses for predicting suicidal ideation was SLC4A4, with a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area under the curve (AUC) of 72%. For bipolar disorder in particular, SLC4A4 predicted suicidal ideation with an AUC of 93%, and future hospitalizations with an AUC of 70%. SLC4A4 is involved in brain extracellular space pH regulation. Brain pH has been implicated in the pathophysiology of acute panic attacks. We also describe two new clinical information apps, one for affective state (simplified affective state scale, SASS) and one for suicide risk factors (Convergent Functional Information for Suicide, CFI-S), and how well they predict suicidal ideation across psychiatric diagnoses (AUC of 85% for SASS, AUC of 89% for CFI-S). We hypothesized a priori, based on our previous work, that the integration of the top biomarkers and the clinical information into a universal predictive measure (UP-Suicide) would show broad-spectrum predictive ability across psychiatric diagnoses. Indeed, the UP-Suicide as able to predict suicidal ideation across psychiatric diagnoses with an AUC of 92%. For bipolar disorder, it predicted suicidal ideation with an AUC of 98%, and future hospitalizations with an AUC of 94%. Of note, both types of tests we developed (blood biomarkers and clinical information apps) do not require asking the individual assessed if they have thoughts of suicide, as individuals who are truly suicidal often do not share that information with clinicians. We propose that the widespread use of such risk prediction tests as part of routine or targeted healthcare assessments will lead to early disease interception followed by preventive lifestyle modifications and proactive treatment."

Background: Alcohol use in adolescence is considered to be a risk factor for later development of substance use problems In this study it was aimed to investigate sociodemqgraphic factors related with substance use among alcohol using university students from five university centres in Turkey. Methods: Using an anonymous self-administered questionaire 586 students recruited from a random student sample (n= 1720) who were regularly drinking (at least once a month) were surveyed. Results: Among the regular alcohol users 12.2% used cannabis at least once during life-time. Ecstasy (3.7%), solvent (1.2%), cocaine (0.6%), and heroin use (0.4%) followed cannabis use. In the mulvariate analysis, staying in a dormitory seemed to be protective in terms of substance use. The risk of substance use was 2.6 times higher in males compared with the female students, and low family income increased the risk of substance use almost 4 times compared with higher income group among regular drinkers. Place of residence of the family seemed to play a mediator role in this relationship. Conclusion: Preventive efforts in substance use should consider the economical as well as social circumstances which can lead to substance use of young people."

Aims This study evaluated the prevalence and reliability of DSM-IV adopted criteria for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse and dependence with a purpose to determine whether it is best conceptualized within the category of hallucinogens, amphetamines or its own category. Design Test-re-test study. Participants MDMA users (life-time use >5 times) were recruited in St Louis, Miami and Sydney (n = 593). The median life-time MDMA consumption was 50 pills at the baseline. Measurements The computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drug (CD-SAM) was used to assess MDMA abuse and dependence. The Discrepancy Interview Protocol (DIP) was used to determine the reasons for the discrepant responses between the two interviews. Reliability of diagnoses, individual diagnostic criteria and withdrawal symptoms was examined using the kappa coefficient (κ). Findings For baseline data, 15% and 59% met MDMA abuse and dependence, respectively. Substantial test-re-test reliability of the diagnoses was observed consistently across cities (κ = 0.69). 'Continued use despite knowledge of physical/psychological problems' (87%) and 'withdrawal' (68%) were the two most prevalent dependence criteria. 'Physically hazardous use' was the most prevalent abuse criterion. Six dependence criteria and all abuse criteria were reported reliably across cities (κ: 0.53-0.77). Seventeen of 19 withdrawal symptoms showed consistency in the reliability across cities. The most commonly reported reason for discrepant responses was 'interpretation of question changed'. Only a small proportion of the total discrepancies were attributed to lying or social desirability. Conclusion The adopted DSM-IV diagnostic classification for MDMA abuse and dependence was moderately reliable across cities. Findings on MDMA withdrawal support the argument that MDMA should be separated from other hallucinogens in DSM. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction."
"2525","1","Double-blind, placebo-controlled, dose-ranging trial of intravenous ketamine as adjunctive therapy in treatment-resistant depression (TRD).^
Numerous placebo-controlled studies have demonstrated the ability of ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to induce rapid (within hours), transient antidepressant effects when administered intravenously (IV) at subanesthetic doses (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). However, the optimal antidepressant dose remains unknown. We aimed to compare to active placebo the rapid acting antidepressant properties of a broad range of subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine among outpatients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A range of IV ketamine doses were compared to active placebo in the treatment of adult TRD over a 3-day period following a single infusion over 40 min. This was an outpatient study conducted across six US academic sites. Outpatients were 18-70 years old with TRD, defined as failure to achieve a satisfactory response (e.g., less than 50% improvement of depression symptoms) to at least two adequate treatment courses during the current depressive episode. Following a washout period, 99 eligible subjects were randomly assigned to one of the five arms in a 1:1:1:1:1 fashion: a single intravenous dose of ketamine 0.1 mg/kg (n = 18), a single dose of ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (n = 20), a single dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg (n = 22), a single dose of ketamine 1.0 mg/kg (n = 20), and a single dose of midazolam 0.045 mg/kg (active placebo) (n = 19). The study assessments (HAM-D-6, MADRS, SDQ, PAS, CGI-S, and CGI-I) were performed at days 0, 1, 3 (endpoint), 5, 7, 14, and 30 to assess the safety and efficacy. The overall group × time interaction effect was significant for the primary outcome measure, the HAM-D-6. In post hoc pairwise comparisons controlling for multiple comparisons, standard dose (0.5 mg/kg) and high dose (1 mg/kg) of intravenous ketamine were superior to active placebo; a low dose (0.1 mg/kg) was significant only prior to adjustment (p = 0.02, p-adj = 0.14, d = -0.82 at day 1). Most of the interaction effect was due to differences at day 1, with no significant adjusted pairwise differences at day 3. This pattern generally held for secondary outcomes. The infusions of ketamine were relatively well tolerated compared to active placebo, except for greater dissociative symptoms and transient blood pressure elevations with the higher doses. Our results suggest that there is evidence for the efficacy of the 0.5 mg/kg and 1.0 mg/kg subanesthetic doses of IV ketamine and no clear or consistent evidence for clinically meaningful efficacy of lower doses of IV ketamine.

Intranasal ketamine has recently gained interest in human medicine, not only for its sedative, anaesthetic or analgesic properties, but also in the management of treatment resistant depression, where it has been shown to be an effective, fast acting alternative treatment. Since several similarities are reported between human psychiatric disorders and canine anxiety disorders, intranasal ketamine could serve as an alternative treatment for anxiety disordered dogs. However, to the authors knowledge, intranasal administration of ketamine and its pharmacokinetics have never been described in dogs. Therefore, this study aimed to examine the pharmacokinetics, absolute bioavailability and tolerability of intranasal ketamine administration compared with intravenous administration. Seven healthy, adult laboratory Beagle dogs were included in this randomized crossover study. The dogs received 2 mg/kg body weight ketamine intravenously (IV) or intranasally (IN), with a two-week washout period. Prior to ketamine administration, dogs were sedated intramuscularly with dexmedetomidine. Venous blood samples were collected at fixed times until 480 min post-administration and ketamine plasma concentrations were determined by liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. Cardiovascular parameters and sedation scores were recorded at the same time points. Non-compartmental pharmacokinetic analysis revealed a rapid (Tmax = 0.25 +/- 0.14 h) and complete IN bioavailability (F = 147.65 +/- 49.97%). Elimination half-life was similar between both administration routes (T1/2el IV = 1.47 +/- 0.24 h, T1/2el IN = 1.50 +/- 0.97 h). Heart rate and sedation scores were significantly higher at 5 and 10 min following IV administration compared to IN administration, but not at the later time-points."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide and is becoming a significant public health threat. Current treatments for MDD primarily consist of monoamine-targeting agents and have limited efficacy. However, the glutamate neurotransmitter system has recently come into focus as a promising alternative for novel antidepressant treatments. We review the current data on the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which has been shown in clinical trials to act as a rapid antidepressant in MDD. We also examine ketamine efficacy on dimensions of psychopathology, including anhedonia, cognition, and suicidality, consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative. Other aspects of ketamine reviewed in this paper include safety and efficacy, different administration methods, and the risks of misuse of ketamine outside of medical settings. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of glutamatergic agents other than ketamine currently being tested as novel antidepressants."

Two modifications of the HPLC-ED method with respect to extraction procedure used have been developed for psilocin, the active metabolite of psilocybin, in human plasma using either liquid-liquid extraction (LLE) or automated on-line solid-phase extraction (on-line SPE). Each type of the sample preparation required a different HPLC system followed by electrochemical detection at 650 to 675 mV. The limit of quantitation of both modifications was 10 ng/ml psilocin. There was no significant difference observable between the LLE and the on-line SPE in terms of method standard deviation (LLE 1.82%, on-line SPE 1.13%) and the analytical results. However, the advantages of on-line SPE in addition to different selectivity were less manual effort, smaller plasma volumes of 400 microl (LLE 2 ml) and a recovery of psilocin in human plasma of nearly 100% (LLE 88%). In contrast to a previous procedure both methods were rapid, simple and reliable and yielded high plasma recoveries. They were used successfully in the quantitation of psilocin in plasma samples obtained from healthy volunteers after p.o. administration of 0.2 mg psilocybin per kg body mass. Plasma concentration curves and pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated."

AIM: To evaluate the effectiveness of an online school-based prevention program for ecstasy (MDMA) and new psychoactive substances (NPS). DESIGN: Cluster randomized controlled trial with two groups (intervention and control). SETTING: Eleven secondary schools in Australia. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 1126 students (mean age: 14.9 years). INTERVENTION: The internet-based Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs module uses cartoon storylines to convey information about harmful drug use. It was delivered once weekly, during a 4-week period, during health education classes. Control schools received health education as usual. MEASUREMENT: Primary outcomes were self-reported intentions to use ecstasy and NPS at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were ecstasy and NPS knowledge and life-time use of ecstasy and NPS. Surveys were administered at baseline, post-intervention and 6 and 12 month post-baseline. FINDINGS: At 12 months, the proportion of students likely to use NPS was significantly greater in the control group (1.8%) than the intervention group [0.5%; odds ratio (OR) = 10.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31-78.91]. However, students' intentions to use ecstasy did not differ significantly between groups (control = 2.1%, intervention = 1.6%; OR = 5.91, 95% CI = 1.01-34.73). There was a significant group difference in the change from baseline to post-test for NPS knowledge (β = -0.42, 95% CI = -0.62 to -0.21, Cohen's d = 0.77), with controls [mean = 2.78, standard deviation (SD = 1.48] scoring lower than intervention students (mean = 3.85, SD = 1.49). There was also evidence of a significant group difference in ecstasy knowledge at post-test (control: mean = 9.57, SD = 3.31; intervention: mean = 11.57, SD = 3.61; β = -0.54, 95% CI = -0.97 to -0.12, P = 0.01, d = 0.73). CONCLUSIONS: The Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs module, a universal online school-based prevention program, appeared to reduce students' intentions to use new psychoactive substances and increased knowledge about ecstasy and new psychoactive substances in the short term."

BACKGROUND: Alcohol and substance use disorders (ASUD) are considered to be among the most frequent comorbidities in schizophrenic and affective psychoses and have a significant negative influence on their course and prognosis. In the present study patients with diagnosis from the ICD-10 category F2 or F3 were examined regarding a substance use disorder in a multicentre cross-section evaluation at nine psychiatric hospitals in Baden-Württemberg. The aim of this study is to discuss the current research on substance use disorders and psychosis comorbidity regarding the theoretical models by means of collected data. METHODS: The examination of 50 consecutive admissions per centre is based on a shortened version of the European Severity Index (Europ ASI). An initial urine drug screening was carried out with all patients after admission. Statistical assessment was based on percentage distributions, mean values, standard deviations and suitable correlation analysis. RESULTS: The representative sample included 448 patients. A proportion of 169 patients (37.7%) had a dual diagnosis F2 and F1 and a proportion of 144 patients (32.1%) had a dual diagnosis F3 and F1; 64 patients (14.3%) had an F2 diagnosis and 71 patients (15.8%) had an F3 diagnosis without ASUD. Apart from lifetime use of alcohol (n = 268) and tobacco (n = 325) hypnotics/tranquilizers (n = 214), cannabis (n = 156), opioids (n = 71), stimulants (n = 96) and hallucinogens (n = 36) were consumed. The most frequent combination and long-term intake consisted of tobacco, alcohol, hypnotics/tranquilizer, cannabis and psychostimulants especially in men with schizophrenic disorders. Regarding motivation before first substance use general psychological adjustment disorders (51%), peer impact (42%) and unspecific affective symptoms were predominant. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether the present study clearly demonstrates that patients suffering from schizophrenia, affective disorders and ASUD have significantly higher rates of more severe substance use disorders in their psychosocial environment and more suicidal behaviour than patients without substance misuse. The high rate in the cross-sectional prevalence of tobacco, alcohol, cannabis and psychostimulant use calls for more effective drug prevention."
"8343","1","Psychometric evaluation of the altered states of consciousness rating scale (OAV).^
BACKGROUND: The OAV questionnaire has been developed to integrate research on altered states of consciousness (ASC). It measures three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet its factorial structure has never been tested by structural equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced ASC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study conducted a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST suggested that the ""oceanic boundlessness"" and ""visionary restructuralization"" factors could be combined on a high level of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities, discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well among the three drug groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug induced ASC."

Objectives: Persistent postsurgical pain (PPP) after thoracotomy effect 50% to 80%. Nerve damage and central sensitization involving NDMDAr activation may play an important role. This study evaluates the efficacy of adding intravenous (IV) or epidural ketamine to thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) after thoracotomy. Materials and Methods: Double-blind randomized study on patients undergoing thoracotomy allocated to one of the following: group Kiv (IV racemic ketamine 0.5 mg/kg preincisional +0.25 mg/kg/h for 48 h), group Kep (epidural racemic ketamine 0.5 mg/kg preincisional +0.25 mg/kg/h for 48 h), or group S (saline). Postoperative analgesia was ensured by TEA with ropivacaine and fentanyl. Pain visual analog scales (VAS), Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, Catastrophizing Scale, and Quantitative Sensory Testing, measuring both the peri-incisional and distant hyperalgesia area, were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively until 6 months. Plasma ketamine levels and stability of the analgesic solutions were analyzed. Results: A total of 104 patients were included. PPP incidence was 20% at 6 months. Pain scores on coughing were significantly lower in Kiv and Kep than in S at 24 and 72 hours, but there were no differences afterwards. There were no significant differences in pain at rest, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, and Catastrophizing Scale, or in the area of mechanical allodynia at any time. Adverse effects were mild. Plasma ketamine levels did not differ significantly between groups. Analgesic solutions were stable. Conclusions: Adding epidural or IV racemic ketamine to TEA after thoracotomy did not lead to any reduction in PPP or allodynia. Epidural administration produced similar plasma ketamine levels to the IV route. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

The results indicate that white subjects scored significantly higher on the five Sensation-Seeking subscales than did either black or Hispanic subjects. No significant differences were obtained between ethnic groups on state or trait anxiety. Even though the prevalence of the use of alcohol, cannabis, street methadone, and cocaine was similar in the three ethnic groups, significantly more white subjects had used amphetamines, barbiturates, tranquilizers, methaqualone, inhalants, and psychedelics. Measures of sensation seeking and anxiety correlated significantly with the number of different drugs used by whites, although the measures were virtually unrelated to drug use among nonwhites. The frequency of use of stimulant, depressant, or hallucinogenic drugs was unrelated to the user's level of sensation seeking or anxiety.

Psilocybin, an indoleamine hallucinogen, produces a psychosis-like syndrome in humans that resembles first episodes of schizophrenia. In healthy human volunteers, the psychotomimetic effects of psilocybin were blocked dose-dependently by the serotonin-2A antagonist ketanserin or the atypical antipsychotic risperidone, but were increased by the dopamine antagonist and typical antipsychotic haloperidol. These data are consistent with animal studies and provide the first evidence in humans that psilocybin-induced psychosis is due to serotonin-2A receptor activation, independently of dopamine stimulation. Thus, serotonin-2A overactivity may be involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and serotonin-2A antagonism may contribute to therapeutic effects of antipsychotics."

Impairment in social functioning is a common source of morbidity across many mental health disorders, yet there is a dearth of effective and easily implemented interventions to support social functioning. MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, peyote, mescaline) represent two potential treatments for impairments in social functioning, as evidence suggests these compounds may be supportive for alleviating social difficulties. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2019) (N = 214,505), we used survey-weighted multivariable ordinal and logistic regression to examine the associations between lifetime use of the aforementioned compounds and impairments in social functioning in the past year. Lifetime MDMA/ecstasy use was associated with lowered odds of three of our four social impairment outcomes: difficulty dealing with strangers (aOR 0.92), difficulty participating in social activities (aOR 0.90), and being prevented from participating in social activities (aOR 0.84). Lifetime mescaline use was also associated with lowered odds of difficulty dealing with strangers (aOR 0.85). All other substances either shared no relationship with impairments in social functioning or conferred increased odds of our outcomes. Future experimental studies can assess whether these relationships are causal."
"514","1","Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^
BACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being. Such a subacute effect would be unusual for a drug that is used non-medically, as withdrawal from other drugs typically either does not affect mood or causes dysphoria. Findings from this convenience sample should be confirmed and extended using surveys of random samples and controlled clinical studies."
"9593","1","Plasma inflammatory cytokines and treatment-resistant depression with comorbid pain: improvement by ketamine.^
BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and pain frequently coexist clinically. Ketamine has analgesic and antidepressant effects, but few studies have evaluated individual differences in antidepressant outcomes to repeated ketamine in TRD patients with comorbid pain. Our aims were to determine the difference in ketamine's antidepressant effects in TRD patients with or without pain and then to examine whether inflammatory cytokines might contribute to ketamine's effect. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with TRD received six infusions of ketamine. Plasma levels of 19 inflammatory cytokines were assessed at baseline and post-infusion (day 13 and day 26) using the Luminex assay. Plasma inflammatory cytokines of sixty healthy controls (HCs) were also examined. RESULTS: TRD patients with pain had a higher antidepressant response rate (χ(2) = 4.062, P = 0.044) and remission rate (χ(2) = 4.062, P = 0.044) than patients without pain. Before ketamine treatment, GM-CSF and IL-6 levels were higher in the pain group than in the non-pain and HC groups. In the pain group, levels of TNF-α and IL-6 at day 13 and GM-CSF, fractalkine, IFN-γ, IL-10, MIP-3α, IL-12P70, IL-17α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-23, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, MIP-1β, and TNF-α at day 26 were lower than those at baseline; in the non-pain group, TNF-α levels at day 13 and day 26 were lower than those at baseline. In the pain group, the changes of IL-6 were associated with improvement in pain intensity (β = 0.333, P = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (β = 0.478, P = 0.005) at day 13. Path analysis showed the direct (β = 2.995, P = 0.028) and indirect (β = 0.867, P = 0.042) effects of changes of IL-6 on improvement in depressive symptoms both were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that an elevated inflammatory response plays a critical role in individual differences in TRD patients with or without pain. Ketamine showed great antidepressant and analgesic effects in TRD patients with pain, which may be related to its effects on modulating inflammation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR , ChiCTR-OOC-17012239.

The rapidly-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine are a trend topic in psychiatry. Despite its robust effects, these are ephemeral and can lead to certain adverse events. For this reason, there is still a general concern around the off-label use of ketamine in clinical practice settings. Nonetheless, for refractory depression, it should be an indication to consider. We report the case of a female patient admitted for several months due to a treatment-resistant depressive bipolar episode with chronic suicidal behaviour. After repeated intravenous ketamine infusions without remarkable side effects, the patient experienced a complete clinical recovery during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge. Unfortunately, depressive symptoms reappeared in the 5th week, and the patient was finally readmitted to hospital as a result of a suicide attempt."

Classical psychedelics (such as psilocybin and LSD) induce psychoactive effects (on behavior or experience) that could contribute to the psychotherapeutic treatment of PTSD but have not yet been investigated in controlled studies. Reported positive effects extend beyond PTSD symptoms only.<br/> CONCLUSION: Psychedelics may have potential to serve as a catalyst for the psychotherapeutic treatment of PTSD. Most evidence exists for MDMA-supported psychotherapy; relatively little research is available on ketamine and classical psychedelics. Future research needs to show whether the use of psychedelics can be integrated into available treatment options for PTSD."
"8952","1","Relational and Growth Outcomes Following Couples Therapy With MDMA for PTSD.^
Healing from trauma occurs in a relational context, and the impacts of traumatic experiences that result in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) go beyond the diagnosis itself. To fully understand a treatment for PTSD, understanding its impact on interpersonal, relational, and growth outcomes yields a more fulsome picture of the effects of the treatment. The current paper examines these secondary outcomes of a pilot trial of Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) for PTSD with MDMA. Six romantic dyads, where one partner had PTSD, undertook a course of treatment combining CBCT for PTSD with two MDMA psychotherapy sessions. Outcomes were assessed at mid-treatment, post-treatment, and 3- and 6-month follow-up. Both partners reported improvements in post-traumatic growth, relational support, and social intimacy. Partners reported reduced behavioral accommodation and conflict in the relationship, and patients with PTSD reported improved psychosocial functioning and empathic concern. These improvements were maintained throughout the follow-up period. These findings suggest that CBCT for PTSD with MDMA has significant effect on relational and growth outcomes in this pilot sample. Improvements in these domains is central to a holistic recovery from traumatic experiences, and lends support to the utility of treating PTSD dyadically."
"2955","1","Ketamine and attentional bias toward emotional faces: Dynamic causal modeling of magnetoencephalographic connectivity in treatment-resistant depression.^
The glutamatergic modulator ketamine rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and bipolar disorder. While its underlying mechanism of antidepressant action is not fully understood, modulating glutamatergically-mediated connectivity appears to be a critical component moderating antidepressant response. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 19 drug-free individuals with TRD and 15 healthy volunteers who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous infusion of saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6–9 h after both drug and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants completed an attentional dot probe task that included emotional faces. Antidepressant response was measured across time points using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure changes in parameter estimates of connectivity via a biophysical model that included realistic local neuronal architecture and receptor channel signaling, modeling connectivity between the early visual cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, and inferior frontal gyrus. Clinically, ketamine administration significantly reduced depressive symptoms in TRD participants. Within the model, ketamine administration led to faster gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) transmission in the early visual cortex, faster NMDA transmission in the fusiform cortex, and slower NMDA transmission in the amygdala. Ketamine administration also led to direct and indirect changes in local inhibition in the early visual cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and to indirect increases in cortical excitability within the amygdala. Finally, reductions in depressive symptoms in TRD participants post-ketamine were associated with faster α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) transmission and increases in gain control of spiny stellate cells in the early visual cortex. These findings provide additional support for the GABA and NMDA inhibition and disinhibition hypotheses of depression and support the role of AMPA throughput in ketamine's antidepressant effects.

"4507","1","Dreamlike effects of LSD on waking imagery in humans depend on serotonin 2A receptor activation.^
RATIONALE: Accumulating evidence indicates that the mixed serotonin and dopamine receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) induces an altered state of consciousness that resembles dreaming. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD produces dreamlike waking imagery and that this imagery depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audiorecorded guided mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). Cognitive bizarreness of guided mental imagery reports was quantified as a standardised formal measure of dream mentation. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. RESULTS: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased cognitive bizarreness (p < 0.001). The LSD-induced increase in cognitive bizarreness was positively correlated with the LSD-induced loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control (p < 0.05). Both LSD-induced increases in cognitive bizarreness and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: LSD produced mental imagery similar to dreaming, primarily via activation of the 5-HT2A receptor and in relation to loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control. Future psychopharmacological studies should assess the differential contribution of the D2/D1 and 5-HT1A receptors to cognitive bizarreness."
"8319","1","Differential tolerance to biological and subjective effects of four closely spaced doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans.^
Tolerance of the behavioral effects of the short-acting, endogenous hallucinogen, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is seen inconsistently in animals, and has not been produced in humans. The nature and time course of responses to repetitive, closely spaced administrations of an hallucinogenic dose of DMT were characterized. Thirteen experienced hallucinogen users received intravenous 0.3 mg/kg DMT fumarate, or saline placebo, four times, at 30 min intervals, on 2 separate days, in a randomized, double-blind, design. Tolerance to ""psychedelic"" subjective effects did not occur according to either clinical interview or Hallucinogen Rating Scale scores. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, cortisol, and heart rate responses decreased with repeated DMT administration, although blood pressure did not. These data demonstrate the unique properties of DMT relative to other hallucinogens and underscore the differential regulation of the multiple processes mediating the effects of DMT."

Objectives: To investigate the prevalence of dissocial behaviour in users of ecstasy and related stimulants (ecstasy users). Methods: A representative community sample of adolescents and young adults were assessed during a five-year procedure that included repeated standardised personal and parental interviews (M-CIDI, SCID-II). Results: Ecstasy users, compared to users of other illicit substances and to non-users, had a significantly higher prevalence of dissocial behaviour and were more likely to be diagnosed with antisocial personality disorder. Conclusions: Use of ecstasy and related stimulants is associated with dissocial behaviour and a higher risk for antisocial personality disorder."
"1563","0","A risk profile of street youth in northern california: Implications for gender-specific human immunodeficiency virus prevention.^
Purpose: To assess human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) risk behaviors of street youth and to determine whether risk behaviors differ by gender or housing status. Methods: Using systematic street-based sampling in four Northern California cities, we recruited 429 street youth (mean age = 19.2 years). Participants completed a structured interview which was used to assess sexual and drug HIV risk behaviors. Results: The majority of youth were heterosexual (85%), white (77%), male (68%), and currently without any type of stable housing (75%). Although 60% of the sample had vaginal sex in the past 30 days, only 44% used a condom the last time they had sex. About one-third (32%) of the sample reported ever injecting drugs, and almost all reported lifetime use of multiple drugs including D-lysergic acid diethylamide (96%), marijuana (90%), alcohol (81%), cocaine (70%), and speed (70%). Compared to males, females were equally likely to use injection and noninjection drugs, but were more likely to be sexually active (P < .001), were more likely to have been diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (P = .005), and were less likely to report consistent condom use (P = .003) or intent to use condoms consistently in the future (P = .005). Compared with those with stable housing, youth who were currently without such housing reported higher rates of injection, and other drug use; females without stable housing were less likely to have used condoms the last time they had vaginal intercourse. Conclusion: The high level of HIV risk behavior in this street-based sample of youth, particularly females and youth without stable housing, suggests an urgent need for gender-specific prevention efforts and an increased range of housing options."
"3489","0","Methodological problems of clinical trials of psychotropic drugs.^
Up to now, clinical studies only succeeded in differentiating between great categories of psychotropic drugs, but failed to prove finer differences of effects within these categories of substances. Two points of the testing method are discussed: problems which arise when rating pathological behaviour problems of sampling psychiatric patients. A great part of symptoms that clinicians and psychologists used to consider as relevant proved to be extremely rare. Total scores cannot be taken as a measure of the therapeutic effect, because they don't adequately express the degree of severity of the illness before and after treatment, and there is a parameter of symptoms that is independent from the observer, i.e., the frequency of the symptom in different clinical pictures. The frequency is an inverse ratio to the specifity of the symptom. It is then argued that even in clinical studies, it would be possible to choose among the variety of descriptive symptoms, those which fulfil requirements of the probabilistic test model of Rasch and to take only those symptoms to characterize the degree of severity of psychic disturbance in trials with psychotropic drugs. Conclusions are then drawn from a study including three groups of physicians (specialists for internal diseases, psychiatrists and general practitioners): failure to differentiate between placebo and a minor tranquilizer was not due to the inefficiency of the drug, but ought to be attributed to the lack of sharpness of the observations made by untrained judges. A significant difference between placebo and the minor tranquilizer was yet found, but only in the group of psychiatrists. The comparison of the first 13 and the last 13 cases in the two remaining groups, however, reveals a learning process in the course of the study. The main problems of sampling are discussed, i.e.: the loss of information as a consequence of taking the mean in a group of psychiatric patients, the role of biological rhythms, which was hitherto insufficiently considered, and finally it is demonstrated in connection with two selected cases of depressive patients that enormous differences of psychophysiological responsiveness can be hidden behind very similar clinical pictures. It is pointed out that the existing research strategy is adjusted to great samples, which were composed on the basis of behavioral characteristics, and that it failed to differentiate subtle effects of psychotropic drugs. Only experiments involving a much greater display, which take into account all aspects of observation of the selected single cases and longitudinal studies can answer the question as to which is the right medicine for the patient. Psychophysiological and biochemical methods have priority over other methods."
"4057","1","Long-term follow-up of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation.^
BACKGROUND: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone. OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at ≥12 months after psilocybin administration. METHODS: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at ≥12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. RESULTS: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (≥16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of substance use disorders is warranted."
"2926","1","Experimentally induced aggressive behavior in subjects with 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (""Ecstasy"") use history: Psychobiological correlates.^
Purpose: Objective measures of experimentally induced aggressiveness were evaluated in 12 male 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") users, in comparison with 20 healthy male subjects. Methods: All the subjects were preliminarily submitted to DSM-IV interviews and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). During a laboratory task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), subjects earned monetary reinforcers with repeated button presses, and were provoked by the subtraction of money that was attributed to a fictitious other participant. Subjects could respond by ostensibly subtracting money from the fictitious subject (the aggressive response). Escape responses were also possible protecting the counter from monetary subtractions. Results: Money-earning responses were not different in Ecstasy users and controls; aggressive responses were significantly higher in Ecstasy users in comparison with control subjects (F=20.74, P<.001). Baseline adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) levels were higher in Ecstasy users than in controls. No difference was found in norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) basal levels of the two groups. During the experimentally induced aggressiveness, plasma ACTH concentrations increased significantly less and NE and EPI levels, together with heart rate (HR), increased significantly more in Ecstasy users than in healthy subjects. Despite ACTH-blunted responses, CORT did not increase differently from controls in Ecstasy users. PSAP aggressive responses positively correlated with catecholamines and CORT changes, BDHI Direct Aggression and Irritability scores, both in Ecstasy users and controls. A significant correlation was found between Ecstasy exposure extent and aggressive responses (r=.78, P<.001). Implications: Our findings suggest that Ecstasy users have higher outward-directed aggressiveness than healthy subjects. Aggressiveness in MDMA subjects seems to be associated more with MDMA pharmacological effects than with personality traits: Nevertheless, a premorbid psychobiological proneness to aggressive behavior cannot be excluded. Increased catecholamines reactivity, basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, and blunted ACTH responses could be due to MDMA action on monoaminergic pathways and adrenal function. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

"3426","0","GMP-compliant radiosynthesis of [18F]altanserin and human plasma metabolite studies.^
[(18)F]altanserin is the preferred radiotracer for in-vivo labeling of serotonin 2A receptors by positron emission tomography (PET). We report a modified synthesis procedure suited for reliable production of multi-GBq amounts of [(18)F]altanserin useful for application in humans. We introduced thermal heating for drying of [(18)F]fluoride as well as for the reaction instead of microwave heating. We furthermore describe solid phase extraction and HPLC procedures for quantitative determination of [(18)F]altanserin and metabolites in plasma. The time course of arterial plasma activity with and without metabolite correction was determined. 90 min after bolus injection, 38.4% of total plasma activity derived from unchanged [(18)F]altanserin. Statistical comparison of kinetic profiles of [(18)F]altanserin metabolism in plasma samples collected in the course of two ongoing studies employing placebo, the serotonin releaser dexfenfluramine and the hallucinogen psilocybin, revealed the same tracer metabolism. We conclude that metabolite analysis for correction of individual plasma input functions used in tracer modeling is not necessary for [(18)F]altanserin studies involving psilocybin or dexfenfluramine treatment."
"2223","1","Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^
In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'). The use of alcohol (ethanol) in combination with ecstasy is common. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine men, seven women) between the ages of 18 and 29. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo-steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10% intravenous ethanol clamp. MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal. Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation. Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol-induced sedation. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90-150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration, with the exception of ethanol-induced sedation, which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped. In conclusion, results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo, but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired. These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy."
"4357","1","Plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans.^
MDMA (±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'ecstasy') is reportedly used recreationally because it increases feelings of sociability and interpersonal closeness. Prior work suggests that the pro-social effects of MDMA may be mediated by release of oxytocin. A direct examination of plasma levels of oxytocin after acute doses of oxytocin and MDMA, in the same individuals, would provide further evidence for the idea that MDMA produces its pro-social effects by increasing oxytocin. Fourteen healthy MDMA users participated in a 4-session, double-blind study in which they received oral MDMA (0.75 and 1.5mg/kg), intranasal oxytocin (20IU or 40IU), and placebo. Plasma oxytocin concentrations, as well as cardiovascular and subjective effects were assessed before and at several time points after drug administration. MDMA (1.5mg/kg only) increased plasma oxytocin levels to a mean peak of 83.7pg/ml at approximately 90-120min, compared to 18.6pg/ml after placebo. Intranasal oxytocin (40IU, but not 20IU) increased plasma oxytocin levels to 48.0pg/ml, 30-60min after nasal spray administration. MDMA dose-dependently increased heart rate, blood pressure, feelings of euphoria (e.g., 'High' and 'Like Drug'), and feelings of sociability, whereas oxytocin had no cardiovascular or subjective effects. The subjective and cardiovascular responses to MDMA were not related to plasma oxytocin levels, although the N was small for this analysis. Future studies examining the effects of oxytocin antagonists on responses to MDMA will help to determine the mechanism by which MDMA produces pro-social effects."
"782","1","Spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional face processing modulations induced by the serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin.^
Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control."
"3126","1","Hallucinogen use is associated with mental health and addictive problems and impulsivity in university students.^
Background: This study examined the prevalence of hallucinogen use in a large sample of university students and its associations with mental health issues. Methods: 9449 students received a 156-item anonymous online survey, which assessed the use of hallucinogens (ever or past year), alcohol and drug use, mental health issues, and impulsive and compulsive traits. Group differences were characterized using statistical tests (p values reported uncorrected, but only regarded as significant if surviving Bonferroni correction). Results: 3525 university students (57.7% female) responded to the survey. The prevalence of past 12-month hallucinogen use in the sample was 4.7%, with an additional 6.4% reporting having used more than 12 months ago. Hallucinogen use was associated with the use of multiple other drugs (e.g., alcohol, opiates) (each p < 0.001), mental health problems (p < 0.001), risky sexual behavior (p < 0.001), low self-esteem (p = 0.004), and impulsivity traits (p < 0.001) but not compulsivity. Effect sizes were small to medium. Conclusion: Past use of hallucinogens was reported in 11.1%, and was associated with a variety of mental health and drug use problems. Clinicians should be aware that use of hallucinogens is common and mental health problems are more likely in those who use hallucinogens. This study indicates the need for longitudinal research into the negative effects of hallucinogen use on brain function and mental health, especially in young people. Such research should address the extent to which impulsive traits predispose to various substance use problems, versus the direct effects of hallucinogens (and other substances) on mental health."
"8010","1","Is depersonalization disorder initiated by illicit drug use any different? A survey of 394 adults.^
Objective: Previous studies have documented that in a substantial minority of individuals with depersonalization disorder, onset is first triggered by illicit drug ingestion. The goal of this study was to systematically compare a large sample of individuals with drug-initiated (D) versus non-drug-initiated (ND) chronic depersonalization. Method: We conducted an internet survey of 394 adults endorsing DSM-IV-TR depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms. Sixty-four questions were utilized to inquire about demographic and clinical characteristics, illness course, substance use history, and treatment response. The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) was administered. The study was conducted from September 2005 to January 2006. Results: Compared to the ND group (n = 198), the D group (n = 196) included more male and younger individuals. The 2 most common precipitating drugs were cannabis and hallucinogens, followed by ecstasy. The majority of participants had modest use histories prior to onset and never ingested subsequently. The 2 groups endorsed similar illness course, impairment, suicidality, and limited treatment response. The D group showed significantly greater improvement over time than the ND group (P = .002), although the groups did not differ in reported psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy effectiveness. The groups did not differ in CDS total score or on the 4 subscale scores of unreality of self, perceptual alterations, unreality of surroundings, and temporal disintegration. On the numbing subscale of the CDS, the ND group scored higher (P = .009) only prior to controlling for age and gender. Conclusion: The study strongly supports a uniform syndrome for chronic depersonalization/derealization regardless of precipitant. © Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."
"3780","1","MDMA enhances ""mind reading"" of positive emotions and impairs ""mind reading"" of negative emotions.^
RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) increases sociability. The prosocial effects of MDMA may result from the release of the ""social hormone"" oxytocin and associated alterations in the processing of socioemotional stimuli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of MDMA (125 mg) on the ability to infer the mental states of others from social cues of the eye region in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The study included 48 healthy volunteers (24 men, 24 women) and used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. A choice reaction time test was used to exclude impairments in psychomotor function. We also measured circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels and subjective drug effects. RESULTS: MDMA differentially affected mind reading depending on the emotional valence of the stimuli. MDMA enhanced the accuracy of mental state decoding for positive stimuli (e.g., friendly), impaired mind reading for negative stimuli (e.g., hostile), and had no effect on mind reading for neutral stimuli (e.g., reflective). MDMA did not affect psychomotor performance, increased circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels, and produced subjective prosocial effects, including feelings of being more open, talkative, and closer to others. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in the ability to correctly read socioemotional information toward stimuli associated with positive emotional valence, together with the prosocial feelings elicited by MDMA, may enhance social approach behavior and sociability when MDMA is used recreationally and facilitate therapeutic relationships in MDMA-assisted psychotherapeutic settings."
"1071","1","Effects of MDMA (ecstasy), and multiple drugs use on (simulated) driving performance and traffic safety.^
RATIONALE: The effects of MDMA on driving behaviour are not clear, since the direct effects of MDMA on cognitive performance are reported as not generally negative. OBJECTIVES: To assess in an advanced driving simulator acute effects on simulated driving behaviour and heart rate of MDMA, and effects of polydrug use. METHODS: A group of young participants who had indicated that they regularly used MDMA were asked to complete test rides in an advanced driving simulator, shortly after the use of MDMA, just before going to a party. They were tested again after having visited the ""rave"", while they were under the influence of MDMA and a number of different other active drugs. Participants were also tested sober, at a comparable time at night. Separately, a control group of participants was included in the experiment. RESULTS: Driving performance in the sense of lateral and longitudinal vehicle control was not greatly affected after MDMA, but deteriorated after multiple drug use. The most striking result was the apparent decreased sense for risk taking, both after MDMA and after multiple drug use. This was clear from gap acceptance data, while the ultimate indicator of unsafe driving, accident involvement or even causation, was increased by 100% and 150%, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Driving under the influence of MDMA alone is certainly not safe; however, driving back (home) after a dance party (""rave"") where MDMA users regularly combine MDMA with a host of other drugs can be described as extremely dangerous."

In recent years, the use of tramadol as a probe drug for human cytochrome p450 2D6 (CYP2D6) has been investigated. The objective of this study was to assess the recovery of rat CYP2D1 enzymatic activity after mechanism-based inhibition induced by a single dose of ecstasy (MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and evaluation of the tramadol ability as a probe drug. CYP2D1 is orthologous in rats to human CYP2D6 and was employed in the current study. A total of 16 male rats were selected and divided into control and treatment groups. The control group did not receive MDMA, while rats in the treatment group received a single dose of MDMA (1 mg/kg) and were subsequently divided into groups that were tested at 1 h, 10 days or 30 days post-administration. The rats were subjected to liver perfusion with Krebs-Heinslet buffer containing tramadol for 60 min and the tramadol and M1 levels were determined by HPLC-fluorescence. The enzymatic activity of CYP2D1 for the 1-h group decreased significantly when compared with the control group (p<0.05). Moreover, enzymatic activity increased non-significantly in the 10- and 30-day groups in comparison with the control group. The concentration and AUC0-60 of tramadol increased in the 1-h and 10-day groups when compared with the control group but decreased in the 30-day group; however, none of these changes was statistically significant (p>0.05). The M1 metabolic ratio in the 1-h group decreased significantly when compared with the control group (p<0.05). The M1 metabolic ratio of the 10-day group increased and of the 30-day group decreased, but neither of these changes were significant. Regardless of the genotype, the enzymatic activity of rat CYP2D1 recovered by 10 days post-administration of MDMA. It appears that tramadol, irrespective of its stereoselectivity, is not able to appraise rat hepatic CYP2D1 activity. It can be extrapolated that tramadol is a not suitable probe drug for human hepatic CYP2D1 because CYP2D1 in rats is orthologous to human CYP2D6. Further animal and human studies are required to confirm this hypothesis. © 2018 2018 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston."

The investigators will assess the effect of acute MDMA modulation on the functioning of reward‐related human brain circuits. Reward‐related brain circuits will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants will include volunteers who report more than two prior uses of MDMA (also known as Ecstasy), when they were 18 years or older. The investigators will recruit individuals who have previously tried MDMA rather than those who are MDMA‐naïve. Participants will receive an oral dose of MDMA ( .75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg) and placebo (saline) at 3 separate study sessions. Following established procedures, these three sessions will be randomized in a blinded protocol in order to limit expectancy effects. Throughout each session, participants will be monitored. Functional imaging will commence after the drug has reached peak levels, following previously established time courses for MDMA administered orally. Participants will also be monitored after the functional imaging session. Secondary effects of MDMA on behavior and self‐reported experience will be assessed. In the assessment of the acute effects of MDMA, the investigators will take into account the cumulative effects of prior drug exposure."

OBJECTIVE: To examine the rate and time to relapse for remitters and responders to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were randomized to a single infusion of one of several doses of intravenous ketamine, or midazolam. Using Kaplan-Meier survival function, the current report examines the rate and time to relapse, defined as MADRS ≥ 22, over a period of 30 days, in subjects who achieved remission (MADRS ≤ 10) or response (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS) on day three post-infusion of intravenous ketamine 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg. RESULTS: Of the 60 randomized participants who received a single ketamine (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) infusion, 19 (34%) met criteria for remission and 27 (48%) for response, on day 3 post-infusion. A numerical dose-response relationship was observed, with remitters/responders on ketamine 1.0 mg/kg having the lowest relapse rate, followed by ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively (% of remitters who relapsed by day 14: 38% with 1.0 mg/kg, 50% with 0.5 mg/kg, 100% with 0.1 mg/kg;% of responders who relapsed by day 14: 30% with 1.0 mg/kg, 50% with 0.5 mg/kg, 80% with 0.1 mg/kg). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small. No MADRS measurements at day one post-infusion. The study was not powered to assess differences in relapse prevention between different doses of ketamine. CONCLUSION: Time to relapse after successful treatment with a single infusion of ketamine appears to follow a dose-response relationship, where higher dosage leads to increased time to relapse."

Subanaesthetic ketamine has recently been established as an effective and rapid treatment for major depressive disorder showing antidepressant effects for up to 1 week on average. The use of repeated ketamine infusions has been put forward to augment and to prolong the antidepressant response and increase the remission rates. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for ketamine's antidepressant effects remain unclear. Nevertheless, it has been shown, both in dogs and humans, that ketamine can alter neuronal perfusion and therefore neuronal function in brain regions involved in psychiatric and behavioural disorders. Consequently, the aim of the current placebo controlled study was to assess the long-term effects on cerebral perfusion of single and repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusions in dogs. Twelve healthy, laboratory dogs were scanned at six different time points following single and repeated ketamine administration, using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography with the radiotracer Tc-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. We hypothesised that repeated infusions could lead to more prolonged perfusion alterations in brain regions critical for behaviour regulation. We found that repeated subanaesthetic ketamine administration did not result in more prolonged cerebral perfusion alterations compared to a single ketamine administration."
"9089","1","Bibliometric Analysis of Academic Journal Articles Reporting Results of Psychedelic Clinical Studies.^
Following a decades long period of investigational dormancy, there is renewed interest in employing psychedelics as psychiatric treatments. The academic journals, institutions, and countries that have helped sustain clinical psychedelic research and the evolution of the literature on clinical studies of psychedelics have only recently begun to be investigated. To expand upon this work, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of clinical studies of 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine, mescaline, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and psilocybin published from 1965-2021. Our search revealed 394 relevant articles. After a lull from the 1970s-1990s, publications in this area have resurged. Studies most frequently focused on MDMA (49%), LSD (19%), psilocybin (18%), and ayahuasca (7%). A subanalysis of studies from 1965 to 2009 (""Older cohort"") compared to 2010-2021 (""Recent cohort"") revealed that the Recent cohort had a higher proportion of studies investigating psychedelics' therapeutic applications and a lower proportion of studies investigating the effects of psychedelics on people using them in non-research settings. Compared to the Older cohort, psilocybin studies increased proportionally in the Recent cohort, while DMT and mescaline studies decreased. Network analyses of inter-country collaborations suggested that psychedelic researchers in the United Kingdom have the most diverse international collaborations."
"3728","1","Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.^
Background: NMDA receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal (S)-ketamine, one of the most potent clinically available NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain of various origins were randomized into two treatment groups: (S)-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (group 1); (S)-ketamine 0.4 mg/kg (group 2). Plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine were measured over 6 h by High Performance Liquid Chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted before, during and after treatment. Side effects and amount of pain reduction were recorded. Results: Intranasal (S)-ketamine administration lead to peak plasma concentrations of 27.7 ± 5.9 ng/ml at 10 ± 6.3 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 22.2 ng/ml at 13.8 ± 4.8 min after application (group 2). Maximal plasma concentrations of (S)-norketamine were 18.3 ± 14.9 ng/ml at 81 ± 59 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml at 75 ± 40 min (group 2). Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups with minimal pain at 60 min after drug administration (70 ± 10% and 61 ± 13% of initial pain in groups 1 and 2). The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine. The time course of analgesia correlated with plasma concentrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8370","1","A qualitative and quantitative account of patient's experiences of ketamine and its antidepressant properties.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is central to one of the most rapidly growing areas of neuroscientific research into novel treatments for depression. Limited research has indicated that the psychedelic properties of ketamine may play a role in its antidepressant effects. AIM: The aim of the current study was to explore the psychedelic experiences and sustained impact of ketamine in major depressive disorder. METHODS: In the current study, ketamine (0.44 mg/kg) was administered to 32 volunteers with major depressive disorder in a crossover design with the active-placebo remifentanil, in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment. The 11-dimension altered states of consciousness questionnaire and individual qualitative interviews were used to capture the acute psychedelic experience. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and further interviewing explored lasting effects. The second qualitative interview took place ⩾3 weeks post-ketamine. RESULTS: Greater antidepressant response (reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale at 24 h) correlated with the 11-dimension altered states of consciousness dimensions: spirituality, experience of unity, and insight. The first qualitative interview revealed that all participants experienced perceptual changes. Additional themes emerged including loss of control and emotional and mood changes. The final interview showed evidence of a psychedelic afterglow, and changes to perspective on life, people, and problems, as well as changes to how participants felt about their depression and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides preliminary evidence for a role of the psychedelic experience and afterglow in ketamine's antidepressant properties. Reflexive thematic analysis provided a wealth of information on participants' experience of the study and demonstrated the psychedelic properties of ketamine are not fully captured by commonly used questionnaires."

In a program of research assessing the validity of the balloon analogue risk task (BART; C. W. Lejuez et al., 2002) as a measure of risk taking, the BART was administered to a sample of inner-city drug users in residential treatment (n = 76). Construct validity of the BART was evaluated by measuring risk-taking behavior and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use while controlling for self-reported impulsivity, sensation seeking, polysubstance use, and demographic variables. Supporting the construct validity of the BART, while controlling for interrelated variables in the context of logistic regression analyses, (BART) risk-taking propensity accounted for significant incremental variance in differentiating MDMA users from non-users. BART scores, polysubstance use, and younger age were most associated with MDMA use, and together these variables were associated with 91% classification accuracy in predicting MDMA use. © 2006 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."
"7576","0","Comparison of Perioperative Systemic Lidocaine or Systemic Ketamine in Acute Pain Management of Patients With Opioid Use Disorder After Orthopedic Surgery.^
INTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Patients with opioid use disorder experience great challenges during acute pain management due to opioid tolerance or withdrawal symptoms. Previous studies have recommended the use of adjuvant drugs in these patients. In this study, we compared the effect of intraoperative lidocaine with ketamine in postoperative pain management of these patients. DESIGN AND METHODS: In this randomized clinical trial, 180 patients with opioid use disorder who underwent orthopedic surgery under general anesthesia were randomly allocated into 3 groups. Patients in groups A, B, and C received intravenous lidocaine, ketamine, or normal saline, respectively, during the operation. Then, postoperative pain scores, analgesic requirements, patient satisfaction, and patient sleepiness were recorded and compared among the 3 groups. RESULTS: Numerical rating scales during the first hour postoperation were significantly lower in the lidocaine group than in the ketamine or control group (P < 0.001). The mean total amount of morphine consumption during the first 24-hour postoperation was 14.49 ± 26.89, 16.59 ± 30.65, and 21.72 ± 43.29 mg in the lidocaine, ketamine, and control group, respectively, being significantly lower in the lidocaine group in comparison with the other groups (P < 0.001). Patients in the lidocaine group were less restless, calmer, and less drowsy than patients in the ketamine and control group (P < 0.001). DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: According to these findings, systemic lidocaine is more effective than systemic ketamine to improve the quality of acute pain management without causing any significant complications in patients with opioid use disorder."

Purpose: Patterns of psychostimulant (PST) use, psychological and physical factors, and family relationships were investigated in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. The differences between users of cocaine (Cc), ecstasy/MDMA, and amphetamine (EA) were analyzed, taking into account gender differences. Methods: Substance use, psychological factors (lifetime suicide attempts, suicidal thoughts in the previous year, visits to a mental health professional), physical factors (health and body shape perceptions (BSP), body mass index (BMI)), and family relationships (existence of disagreements with parents, relationships with mother and father) were investigated in 26,351 17-year-old French adolescents. Results: Lifetime suicidal behavior was strongly associated with EA use only. Suicidal ideation in the previous year was associated with Cc use among both boys and girls and associated with EA use among girls. Compared to Cc users, more EA users were overweight, while more Cc users were underweight compared to EA users. BSP, BMI, and EA use were related in girls only. Having a good or very good relationship with both mother and father was negatively associated with Cc use in boys and girls. Girls who had a good or very good relationship with their fathers seemed to be less prone to use EA. Boys with a good or very good relationship with their mothers seemed to be less prone to use EA. Conclusion: The results of the present study could serve as a basis for prevention and harm reduction strategies/programs targeting youth use and for the adaptation of these strategies/programs according to substance and gender."
"7216","1","A phase 1/2 trial to assess safety and efficacy of a vaporized 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine formulation (GH001) in patients with treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a substantial public health burden, but current treatments have limited effectiveness. The aim was to investigate the safety and potential antidepressant effects of the serotonergic psychedelic drug 5-MeO-DMT in a vaporized formulation (GH001) in adult patients with TRD. METHODS: The Phase 1 part (n = 8) of the trial investigated two single dose levels of GH001 (12 mg, 18 mg) with a primary endpoint of safety, and the Phase 2 part (n = 8) investigated an individualized dosing regimen (IDR) with up to three increasing doses of GH001 (6 mg, 12 mg, and 18 mg) within a single day, with a primary endpoint of efficacy, as assessed by the proportion of patients in remission (MADRS ≤ 10) on day 7. RESULTS: Administration of GH001 via inhalation was well tolerated. The proportion of patients in remission (MADRS ≤ 10) at day 7 was 2/4 (50%) and 1/4 (25%) in the 12 mg and 18 mg groups of Phase 1, respectively, and 7/8 (87.5%) in the IDR group of Phase 2, meeting its primary endpoint (p < 0.0001). All remissions were observed from day 1, with 6/10 remissions observed from 2 h. The mean MADRS change from baseline to day 7 was -21.0 (-65%) and - 12.5 (-40%) for the 12 and 18 mg groups, respectively, and - 24.4 (-76%) for the IDR. CONCLUSION: Administration of GH001 to a cohort of 16 patients with TRD was well tolerated and provided potent and ultra-rapid antidepressant effects. Individualized dosing with up to three doses of GH001 on a single day was superior to single dose administration.Clinical Trial registration: Clinicaltrials.gov Identifier NCT04698603."
"5834","1","[Ketamine administration in case of severe, therapy resistant depressed patient, case report].^
Objective - In our case report we present the treatment of a female patient suffering from therapy resistant depression. This procedure is not in practice in Hungary at present, the aim of our work to reproduce the findigs of international studies in domestic circumstances. Matter - Major depression is a common, chronic and severe mental disorder, with 16.2% lifetime prevalence. Many international randomized, placebo controlled trials found administration of ketamine infusion effective in depressed patients. Methods - Since ketamine is an anesthetic agent, its administration was performed in the post-operative monitoring room of our hospital operating-room, supervised by an anesthesiologist. According to formerly published data, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight was administered intravenously in 40 minutes by perfusor. The drug was administered in a same manner fifteen days later. Subject - The patient was admitted to our inpatient ward with severe depression. During two months of combined antidepressant therapy her condition has not improved significantly. Approval for off label drug indication was granted with urgency by the National Institute of Quality and Organizational Development in Healthcare and Medicines. Results - During the two treatments the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items rating scale score was reduced to 8 from the baseline 28, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score was reduced to 6 from 25, Beck Depression Inventory was reduced to 9 from 20. Upon administration of the drug no severe adverse event was detected, the mild dissociative state related to ketamine was ceased in a short period of time. Discussion - With administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine the authors managed to achieve rapid improvement in a therapy resistant depressed patient, without permanent side effects. Our future plan is to repeat the use of the drug within a double-blind, placebo controlled trial in order to prove its efficacy in hospital settings."

There is an increasing interest in potential medical applications of ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea with a long cultural history of indigenous medical and religious use. Clinical research into ayahuasca will require specific, sensitive and comprehensive methods for the characterization and quantitation of these compounds and their metabolites in blood. A combination of two analytical techniques (high-performance liquid chromatography with ultraviolet and/or fluorescence detection and gas chromatography with nitrogen-phosphorus detection) has been used for the analysis of some of the constituents of ayahuasca in blood following its oral consumption. We report here a single methodology for the direct analysis of 14 of the major alkaloid components of ayahuasca, including several known and potential metabolites of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and the harmala alkaloids in blood. The method uses 96-well plate/protein precipitation/filtration for plasma samples, and analysis by HPLC-ion trap-ion trap-mass spectrometry using heated electrospray ionization to reduce matrix effects. The method expands the list of compounds capable of being monitored in blood following ayahuasca administration while providing a simplified approach to their analysis. The method has adequate sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility to make it useful for clinical research with ayahuasca. © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

Conflicting studies of the relationship between therapeutic use of psychostimulant medication and substance abuse have long been a subject of concern among clinicians and researchers. One controlled longitudinal study examined this relationship in 147 patients who were diagnosed with hyperactivity as young children and were surveyed with regard to their substance use both as adolescents and as adults. This study found that stimulant therapy for attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder in childhood is not associated with increased risk of adolescent experimentation with substance use, frequency of such use, or the risk of developing psychoactive substance use disorders by young adulthood. Moreover, stimulant therapy in high school may well have provided a protective effect against hallucinogen abuse by adulthood. A possible explanation for contradictory findings previously published was suggested by the existence of a number of potentially confounding variables, particularly conduct disorders, for which prior studies have failed to control."
"6215","0","Comparision of Motor Seizure Duration of Ketofol and Propofol for Electroconvulsive Therapy.^
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a common treatment method used in severe depression and other psychiatric diseases. Currently, most ECT procedures are carried out with muscle paralysis under general anesthesia. It is important to establish an accurate balance between adequate anesthesia depth and optimal seizure duration. The objective of anesthesia during ECT is to provide a rapid onset and balance of both unconsciousness and muscle relaxation for the duration of the electrical stimulus and subsequent seizure .Therefore, anesthetics that are used for general anesthesia during ECT should have rapid onset, rapid emergence, no interference with seizure activity and longer seizure duration. A motor seizure lasting 20‐25 seconds at minimum has been typically recommended for therapeutic efficacy of ECT . Common drugs used for ECT anesthesia are methohexital, thiopental, etomidate, propofol and ketamine. Methohexital exerts depressant action on seizure activity and is contraindicated in patients acute intermittent porphyria. Etomidate causes increased incidence of emesis. Similarly incidence of sinus bradycardia and premature ventricular contraction increased with the use of thiopental during ECT procedures . For these reasons methohexital, thiopental and etomidate are not used in current anesthetic practice for electroconvulsive therapy Propofol as an anaesthetic in ECT has favorable characteristics such as rapid onset and emergence from anesthesia, minimal postoperative confusion and a lower incidence of hypertension or tachycardia during induction of anesthesia. However, it produces a dose‐ dependent decrease in seizure duration . Ketamine, is also used as an anesthetic agent in ECT because it has a favorable seizure inducing effect and increased seizure duration. But it is also not devoid of disadvantages. Its main disadvantages are that it produces hypertension, delayed recovery and precipitates psychomimetic emergence phenomena . So ketofol (1:1combination of ketamine and propofol) can be a good alternative to either propofol or ketamine used alone for anesthetic management for ECT. Ketamine mitigates propofol‐induced hypotension, and propofol mitigates ketamine‐induced vomiting and emergence agitation. Ketofol can also have better outcome on motor seizure duration than propofol alone. Therefore, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that ketofol would be a good alternative anesthetic agent and better than propofol for ECT procedures.After obtaining approval from Institutional Review committee (IRC) of TUTH and Nepal health research council (NHRC) the process of enrolling the eligible patients into the study will be started. Patients will be assessed for eligibility. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not having the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be divided into two groups: Group P (propofol group,n=27) and Group K (ketofol group ,n=27) using computer generated random numbers. Blinding will be done by sealed envelope technique. Pre‐anesthetic checkup will be conducted and a detailed history and complete physical examination will be done prior to procedure. Informed consent will be taken from the legal guardian of patient. Patient will be transferred to the pre anesthetic room. Baseline hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, SPO2 and HR) will be taken and recorded. An 18 G IV cannula will be secured in appropriate hand of patient. Patient will be premedicated with glycopyrolate 0.2 mg 30 minutes prior to procedure. Patient will be transferred to operation theatre. III ECG leads, SPO2 probe and NIBP pressure cuff will be attached. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be continually monitored. Preoxygenation will be done via facemask at the rate of 5liter/min for 5 minutes. Anesthesia assistant will pick an envelope for each patient. Test solution will be prepared by anesthesia assistant as per the instructions in the envelope. Group K ‐ In 1 ml syringe, 2ml of ketamine (50mg/ml solution) and 8ml of normal saline will be drawn to make the 10mg/ml solution of ketamine. Finally in another new 10 ml syringe 5ml of the freshly prepared solution of ketamine (10mg/ml) and 5ml of propofol (10mg/ml) will be mixed. The study drug thus prepared will contain 5mg /ml of propofol and 5mg / ml of ketamine. There will be two such 10ml syringe of ketofol. Group P ‐ propofol (10mg/ml solution) will be drawn in labeled 10ml syringe. Two such 10ml syringes of propofol will be prepared. Patient in Group K will be administered an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg ketofol (0.25 mg/kg of propofol + 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine). Similarly, patient in Group P will be given an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg propofol. In both the group this initial dose will be given within 15 seconds. Five seconds after administration of drug, patient will be assessed for unresponsiveness to verbal commands (by calling patient's name) & loss of eyelash reflex. Then titrated dose of drug will be given at the rate of 1ml every 5 seconds until the patient no longer responds to verbal commands and there is loss of eyelash reflex. The required total dose of propofol or ketofol will be recorded. After loss of consciousness, hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, HR & SPO2) will be taken and recorded. An isolated forearm technique will be performed by inflating the tourniquet in arm where the iv cannula is not placed. Then, succinylcholine, 1 mg/kg iv will be administered. Ventilation will be assisted with 100 % oxygen via face mask in all groups during the procedure. Bite block will be used prior to application of bifrontal electrodes. Then a psychiatrist blinded to the study groups will administer electrical stimuli through bifrontal electrodes. The frequency will be set at 90Hz and current will be set at 800 milliampere. The duration of the motor seizure will be defined as the time from the ECT stimulus to cessation of tonic‐clonic motor activity in the 'isolated' arm. After the end of seizure, bite block will be removed and ventilation will be continued with 100% oxygen via face mask. The duration of motor seizures will be recorded. Hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP and HR) will be recorded 1mins and 5 mins after the end of seizure. Common complication encountered during ECT are transient hypertension and tachycardia. Esmolol 5mg iv bolus will be given during such episodes. The time from the end of succinylcholine administration until spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and obeying commands will be recorded. Once the patient is awake, obeys commands and maintains oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen, the patient will be transferred to postoperative room. Patient will be monitored with ECG, pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure for one hour in postoperative room and then the patient will be transferred."
"5305","0","Evaluating the Potential Use of Serotonergic Psychedelics in Autism Spectrum Disorder.^
Recent clinical and preclinical evidence points towards empathogenic and prosocial effects elicited by psychedelic compounds, notably the serotonin 5-HT(2A) agonists lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and their derivatives. These findings suggest a therapeutic potential of psychedelic compounds for some of the behavioural traits associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a neurodevelopmental condition characterized by atypical social behaviour. In this review, we highlight evidence suggesting that psychedelics may potentially ameliorate some of the behavioural atypicalities of ASD, including reduced social behaviour and highly co-occurring anxiety and depression. Next, we discuss dysregulated neurobiological systems in ASD and how they may underlie or potentially limit the therapeutic effects of psychedelics. These phenomena include: 1) synaptic function, 2) serotonergic signaling, 3) prefrontal cortex activity, and 4) thalamocortical signaling. Lastly, we discuss clinical studies from the 1960s and 70s that assessed the use of psychedelics in the treatment of children with ASD. We highlight the positive behavioural outcomes of these studies, including enhanced mood and social behaviour, as well as the adverse effects of these trials, including increases in aggressive behaviour and dissociative and psychotic states. Despite preliminary evidence, further studies are needed to determine whether the benefits of psychedelic treatment in ASD outweigh the risks associated with the use of these compounds in this population, and if the 5-HT(2A) receptor may represent a target for social-behavioural disorders."
"8298","1","Relationship between ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms and NMDA receptor occupancy: a [(123)I]CNS-1261 SPET study.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine induces effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. These are thought to arise through its action as an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. OBJECTIVES: We used [(123)I]CNS-1261 to study ketamine binding to NMDA receptors in healthy human controls in vivo and its relationship to positive and negative psychotic symptom induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy controls underwent two single-photon emission tomography scans with [(123)I]CNS-1261. On each occasion, they received a bolus infusion of either ketamine or saline. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was administered at the end of each scan. Predefined regions of interest were used to estimate change in volume of distribution of [(123)I]CNS-1261 following ketamine administration. Two normalised-to-cortex binding indices were also used in order to study effects of ketamine on NMDA receptor availability by region, after correction for global and nonspecific effects. RESULTS: Ketamine-induced reduction in [(123)I]CNS-1261 volume of distribution in all regions showed the strongest correlation with BPRS negative subscale (p < 0.01). With the normalised-to-cortex measures, NMDA receptor binding in middle inferior frontal cortex showed a significant correlation with BPRS negative subscale (BI1 r = 0.88, BI2 r = 95.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: [(123)I]CNS-1261 binding was modulated by ketamine, a drug known to compete for the same site on the NMDA receptor in vitro. Ketamine may induce negative symptoms through direct inhibition of the NMDA receptor, and positive symptoms may arise through a different neurochemical pathway."
"8257","1","P.0828 Psilocybin enhances emotional response to music in healthy individuals.^
Background: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic which produces its profound effects on consciousness primarily as a serotonin 2A receptor (5‐HT2AR) agonist [1]. Music is considered integral to the administration of psychedelics and is used to provide support in altered states of consciousness [2]. Retrospectively reported experiences with music during psilocybin‐assisted antidepressant treatment have been associated with positive treatment outcome [3], suggesting that music contributes to clinical effects although the processes involved are not clear. Music can evoke a variety of emotions and previous experimental work with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) suggests that this emotional response may be enhanced by 5‐HT2AR agonism [4], implicating emotional processing as a synergetic interface between music and psychedelics. However, it is not known whether emotional response to music is enhanced with psilocybin or reduced by 5‐HT2AR antagonism. In this study we therefore sought to elucidate the effects of intervention with psilocybin as compared to intervention with the 5‐HT2AR antagonist ketanserin on emotional response to music. For this purpose, we chose an excerpt of the classical music program Positive Affect used to facilitate emotional experiences within traditional music therapy. Methods: We included 20 healthy individuals (10 women) with a mean age of 33 years (range: 24‐58) in this randomized (psilocybin or ketanserin first) cross‐over, single‐blinded study. Participants received 0.3mg/kg of psilocybin or 20mg of ketanserin (n=14) on two separate intervention days. At baseline and during the period of peak drug levels, participants listened to the music program and reported their emotional response to the music immediately afterwards using the 9‐item Geneva Emotional Music Scale (GEMS) [5]. The music program included Edward Elgar, Enigma Variations no. 8 and 9 and Amadeus Mozart, Laudate Dominum (app. 10 minutes). Differences in GEMS total score between psilocybin and baseline (n=20), psilocybin and ketanserin (n=14), and ketanserin and baseline (n=14) were evaluated using paired‐samples t‐tests. Effect sizes are reported with Hedge's g and p‐values are corrected using the Bonferroni‐Holm method. Results: Psilocybin significantly increased GEMS compared to baseline (ΔGEMSPsi‐Base [95% CI], p‐value, Hedge's g: 19.6 [8.8; 29.5], pcorr=0.003, g=0.9), and compared to ketanserin (ΔGEMSPsi‐Ket: 35.5 [20.1; 50.9], pcorr=0.002, g=1.5), while ketanserin decreased GEMS compared to baseline (ΔGEMSKet‐Base: ‐10.5 [‐19; ‐2], pcorr=0.02, g=‐0.8). Conclusion: We found that psilocybin markedly enhanced the emotional response to music in healthy individuals, both as compared to baseline and ketanserin. Interestingly, ketanserin decreased the emotional response to music as compared to baseline, suggesting a modulating role of 5‐HT2AR in music‐evoked emotions. These findings add to our empirical knowledge about the interplay between psilocybin and music in shaping the intense emotional states typical of psychedelic phenomenology. Insights such as these are critical for more effectively leveraging the clinical potential of music, e.g., prepare and integrate psychedelic sessions through music listening aimed at increasing emotional awareness. Understanding the contribution of enhanced music‐evoked emotions to other prototypical psychedelic phenomena, e.g., mystical type experiences, will also be important for establishing music as a key element in psychedelic therapy.

"7328","1","Prevalence and risk factors for LSD use among young women.^
Study Objective: To report the lifetime prevalence of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and to identify unique correlates of using this substance in the last year among a large multiethnic sample of sexually active adolescent and young adult women aged 14 to 26 yrs. Design, Setting, Participants: A cross-sectional survey, administered at university-based ambulatory reproductive health clinics, was completed by 904 women between April and November of 1997 to identify risk factors associated with their use of LSD within the past 12 months. Subjects who reported lifetime, but not past 12 months', use of marijuana, LSD, or other illicit drugs were excluded, leaving a sample of 368 nonusers and 56 users of LSD. In addition, 231 young women who reported only using marijuana in the last year were used as a comparison group to identify unique factors associated with LSD use. Results: Of the total sample (n=904), 13% (n=119) reported lifetime use of LSD, and 58% (n=536) reported lifetime use of marijuana. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age and race/ethnicity found distinct profiles for those who reported using LSD or only marijuana in the last year when compared to those who reported no substance use. Common to both groups was reporting being drunk at least 10 times during the last year, regular smoking of at least half a pack of cigarettes, and identification as a high-sexual-risk taker. However, LSD users as compared to nonusers were more likely to report white ethnicity (as compared to nonwhite), be less than or equal to 17 years of age (as compared to at least 18 years), report a history of physical abuse, and be categorized as having severe depressive symptomatology. In contrast, those who reported only using marijuana were more likely to report single marital status, young age at first intercourse, having half or more of their friends use marijuana, and poor grades. Conclusions: The female LSD user presents a distinct profile that might aid clinicians in identifying potential LSD use in this population as well as alerting clinicians to the relationship between LSD use and high-risk sexual behaviors."

BACKGROUND: Illicit stimulant use is associated with long-lasting changes in movement and movement-related brain regions. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of movement dysfunction in this population. We hypothesized that prevalence of self-reported movement dysfunction is higher among stimulant users than non-stimulant users. METHODS: Three groups of adults completed a survey containing questions about demographics, health, drug use, and movement. The groups consisted of ecstasy users with no history of methamphetamine use (ecstasy group, n = 190, 20 ± 3 yrs.), methamphetamine users (methamphetamine group, n = 331, 23 ± 5 yrs.), and non-stimulant users (control group, n = 228, 25 ± 8 yrs.). Movement data was analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted logistic regression model, group had a significant effect on fine hand control, tremor, and voice/speech questions, but not on other movement domain questions. The prevalence of tremor and abnormal fine hand control was significantly higher in the ecstasy and methamphetamine groups than in the control group (p < 0.018), and changes in voice/speech was more prevalent in the ecstasy group than in the control group (p = 0.015). Age and use of cannabis and hallucinogens were confounding variables. However, inspection of chi-square tables suggests that the effect of these parameters on the movement data is likely to be minor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported tremor and changes in fine hand control and voice/speech is significantly higher in stimulant users than in non-stimulant users. Inclusion of these common and noticeable changes in body function may aid public health campaigns that target prevention or harm minimization."
"9302","1","Hallucinogen-related disorders in a national sample of adolescents: The influence of ecstasy/MDMA use.^
Aims: To present the prevalence and correlates of hallucinogen use disorders (HUDs: abuse or dependence) and subthreshold dependence. Methods: The study sample included adolescents aged 12-17 years (N = 55,286) who participated in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2004-2006). Data were collected with a combination of computer-assisted personal interviewing and audio computer-assisted self-interviewing. Results: The overall prevalence of HUDs among adolescents was low (<1%). However, more than one in three (38.5%) MDMA users and nearly one in four (24.1%) users of other hallucinogens reported HUD symptoms. MDMA users were more likely than users of other hallucinogens to meet criteria for hallucinogen dependence: 11% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 8.24-14.81) vs. 3.5% (95% CI: 2.22-5.43). Compared with hallucinogen use only, subthreshold dependence was associated with being female (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 1.8 [95% CI: 1.08-2.89]), ages 12-13 years (AOR = 3.4 [1.64-7.09]), use of hallucinogens ≥52 days (AOR = 2.4 [1.66-6.92]), and alcohol use disorder (AOR = 1.8 [1.21-2.77]). Compared with subthreshold dependence, abuse was associated with mental health service use (AOR = 1.7 [1.00-3.00]) and opioid use disorder (AOR = 4.9 [1.99-12.12]); dependence was associated with MDMA use (AOR = 2.2 [1.05-4.77]), mental health service use (AOR = 2.9 [1.34-6.06]), and opioid use disorder (AOR = 2.6 [1.01-6.90]). MDMA users had a higher prevalence of most other substance use disorders than users of non-hallucinogen drugs. Conclusions: Adolescent MDMA users appear to be particularly at risk for exhibiting hallucinogen dependence and other substance use disorders. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"8829","1","Heritability of lifetime ecstasy use.^
Background Ecstasy is a widely used psychoactive drug that users often take because they experience positive effects such as increased euphoria, sociability, elevated mood, and heightened sensations. Ecstasy use is not harmless and several immediate and long term side effects have been identified. Lifetime ecstasy use is likely to be partly influenced by genetic factors, but no twin study has determined the heritability. Here, we apply a classical twin design to a large sample of twins and siblings to estimate the heritability of lifetime ecstasy use. Methods The sample comprised 8500 twins and siblings aged between 18 and 45 years from 5402 families registered at the Netherlands Twin Registry. In 2013–2014 participants filled out a questionnaire including a question whether they had ever used ecstasy. We used the classical twin design to partition the individual differences in liability to ecstasy use into that due to genetic, shared environmental, and residual components. Results Overall, 10.4% of the sample had used ecstasy during their lifetime, with a somewhat higher prevalence in males than females. Twin modelling indicated that individual differences in liability to lifetime ecstasy use are for 74% due to genetic differences between individuals, whereas shared environmental and residual factors explain a small proportion of its liability (5% and 21%, respectively). Although heritability estimates appeared to be higher for females than males, this difference was not significant. Conclusions Lifetime ecstasy use is a highly heritable trait, which indicates that some people are genetically more vulnerable to start using ecstasy than others."
"2550","0","MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD: Are memory reconsolidation and fear extinction underlying mechanisms?.^
MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD has recently progressed to Phase 3 clinical trials and received Breakthrough Therapy designation by the FDA. MDMA used as an adjunct during psychotherapy sessions has demonstrated effectiveness and acceptable safety in reducing PTSD symptoms in Phase 2 trials, with durable remission of PTSD diagnosis in 68% of participants. The underlying psychological and neurological mechanisms for the robust effects in mitigating PTSD are being investigated in animal models and in studies of healthy volunteers. This review explores the potential role of memory reconsolidation and fear extinction during MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. MDMA enhances release of monoamines (serotonin, norepinephrine, dopamine), hormones (oxytocin, cortisol), and other downstream signaling molecules (BDNF) to dynamically modulate emotional memory circuits. By reducing activation in brain regions implicated in the expression of fear- and anxiety-related behaviors, namely the amygdala and insula, and increasing connectivity between the amygdala and hippocampus, MDMA may allow for reprocessing of traumatic memories and emotional engagement with therapeutic processes. Based on the pharmacology of MDMA and the available translational literature of memory reconsolidation, fear learning, and PTSD, this review suggests a neurobiological rationale to explain, at least in part, the large effect sizes demonstrated for MDMA in treating PTSD."
"2300","0","Mechanisms of action of current and potential pharmacotherapies of obsessive-compulsive disorder.^
A significant body of evidence documented that the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) and the head of caudate nucleus are involved in the mediation of obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) symptoms. Potent serotonin (5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) are the only antidepressant agents thus far shown to be effective in the treatment of OCD. The present review summarizes information on 5-HT release and the adaptive changes in pre- and postsynaptic 5-HT receptors sensitivity induced by SRI treatment in rat and guinea pig structures involved in OCD. It emphasizes that the time course for the occurrence of increased 5-HT release and terminal 5-HT1D desensitization is congruent with the delayed therapeutic response to SRI in OCD. In addition, a greater dose of SRI inducing a greater degree of reuptake inhibition may play an essential role in this phenomenon. This is consistent with the common clinical observation that high doses of SRIs are sometimes necessary to obtain an anti-OCD effect, and with the results of some fixed-dose double blind trials showing a dose-dependent therapeutic effect of SRIs. It is hypothesized that enhanced 5-HT release in the OFC is mediated by the activation of normosensitive postsynaptic 5-HT2-like receptors and underlies the therapeutic action of SRI in OCD. This is supported by the beneficial effect of some hallucinogens with 5-HT2 agonistic properties in obtaining a more rapid therapeutic response. Finally, based on this knowledge, new strategies aimed at producing more rapid, effective and safe anti-OCD drugs, such as a selective action on terminal 5-HT1D receptors, on 5-HT2 receptors as well as on the glutamate system, are discussed."
"5413","0","Association between cannabis use disorder symptom severity and probability of clinically-documented diagnosis and treatment in a primary care sample.^
BACKGROUND: Brief cannabis screening followed by standardized assessment of symptoms may support diagnosis and treatment of cannabis use disorder (CUD). This study tested whether the probability of a medical provider diagnosing and treating CUD increased with the number of substance use disorder (SUD) symptoms documented in patients' EHRs. METHODS: This observational study used EHR and claims data from an integrated healthcare system. Adult patients were included who reported daily cannabis use and completed the Substance Use Symptom Checklist, a scaled measure of DSM-5 SUD symptoms (0-11), during routine care 3/1/2015-3/1/2021. Logistic regression estimated associations between SUD symptom counts and: 1) CUD diagnosis; 2) CUD treatment initiation; and 3) CUD treatment engagement, defined based on Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set (HEDIS) ICD-codes and timelines. We tested moderation across age, gender, race, and ethnicity. RESULTS: Patients (N=13,947) were predominantly middle-age, male, White, and non-Hispanic. Among patients reporting daily cannabis use without other drug use (N=12,568), the probability of CUD diagnosis, treatment initiation, and engagement increased with each 1-unit increase in Symptom Checklist score (p's<0.001). However, probabilities of diagnosis, treatment, and engagement were low, even among those reporting ≥2 symptoms consistent with SUD: 14.0% diagnosed (95% CI: 11.7-21.6), 16.6% initiated treatment among diagnosed (11.7-21.6), and 24.3% engaged in treatment among initiated (15.8-32.7). Only gender moderated associations between Symptom Checklist and diagnosis (p=0.047) and treatment initiation (p=0.012). Findings were similar for patients reporting daily cannabis use with other drug use (N=1379). CONCLUSION: Despite documented symptoms, CUD was underdiagnosed and undertreated in medical settings."
"5264","0","Improving Suicide Prevention Through Evidence-Based Strategies: A Systematic Review.^
OBJECTIVE: The authors sought to identify scalable evidence-based suicide prevention strategies. METHODS: A search of PubMed and Google Scholar identi- fied 20,234 articles published between September 2005 and December 2019, of which 97 were randomized controlled trials with suicidal behavior or ideation as primary outcomes or epidemiological studies of limiting access to lethal means, using educational approaches, and the impact of antidepressant treatment. RESULTS: Training primary care physicians in depression rec- ognition and treatment prevents suicide. Educating youths on depression and suicidal behavior, as well as active out- reach to psychiatric patients after discharge or a suicidal crisis, prevents suicidal behavior. Meta-analyses find that antidepressants prevent suicide attempts, but individual randomized controlled trials appear to be underpowered. Ketamine reduces suicidal ideation in hours but is untested for suicidal behavior prevention. Cognitive-behavioral therapy and dialectical behavior therapy prevent suicidal behavior. Active screening for suicidal ideation or behavior is not proven to be better than just screening for depression. Education of gatekeepers about youth suicidal behavior lacks effectiveness. No randomized trials have been reported for gatekeeper training for prevention of adult suicidal behavior. Algorithm-driven electronic health record screening, Internet-based screening, and smartphone passive monitoring to identify high-risk patients are under-studied. Means restriction, including of firearms, prevents suicide but is sporadically employed in the United States, even though firearms are used in half of all U.S. suicides. CONCLUSIONS: Training general practitioners warrants wider implementation and testing in other nonpsychiatrist physi- cian settings. Active follow-up of patients after discharge or a suicide-related crisis should be routine, and restricting firearm access by at-risk individuals warrants wider use. Combination approaches in health care systems show promise in reducing suicide in several countries, but evaluating the benefit attributable to each component is essential. Further suicide rate reduction requires evaluating newer approaches, such as electronic health record-derived algorithms, Internet-based screening methods, ketamine's potential benefit for preventing attempts, and passive monitoring of acute suicide risk change.Reprinted from Am J Psychiatry 2021; 178:611-624, with permission from American Psychiatric Association Publishing.

"1187","1","Ketogenic diet and ketamine infusion treatment to target chronic persistent eating disorder psychopathology in anorexia nervosa: a pilot study.^
PURPOSE: Anorexia nervosa (AN) is a severe psychiatric disorder, and shape and weight concerns are often chronic despite weight normalization. No specific treatments exist for those preoccupations that interfere with recovery and trigger relapse. A case study using a ketogenic diet followed by ketamine infusions led to sustained remission in one patient with chronic AN. Here we conducted an open-label trial to test whether this response could be replicated. METHODS: Five adults weight recovered from AN but with persistent eating disorder thoughts and behaviors adopted a therapeutic ketogenic diet (TKD) aimed at maintaining weight. After sustaining nutritional ketosis, participants received six ketamine infusions and were followed over 6 months. RESULTS: All participants completed the study protocol without significant adverse effects. Two participants maintained TKD for 8 weeks prior to ketamine infusions due to good behavioral response and remained on TKD. Three participants received TKD for 4 weeks prior to and during ketamine, then tapered off after the final infusion. The group showed significant improvements on the Clinical Impairment Assessment (p = 0.008), Eating Disorder Examination Questionnaire (EDEQ) Global score (p = 0.006), EDEQ-Eating Concerns (p = 0.005), EDEQ-Shape Concerns (p = 0.016), EDEQ-Weight Concerns (p = 0.032), Eating Disorders Recovery Questionnaire (EDRQ) Acceptance of Self and Body (0.027) and EDRQ-Social and Emotional Connection (p = 0.001). Weight remained stable, except for one participant who relapsed 4 months after treatment and off TKD. CONCLUSION: This novel treatment appears to be safe and effective for adults with chronic AN-related psychopathology. The results from this open trial support that there are specific neurobiological underpinnings of AN that can be normalized using TKD and ketamine. LEVEL OF EVIDENCE: Level IV, multiple time series with intervention."
"1770","1","Glycine transporter inhibitor attenuates the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in healthy males: preliminary evidence.^
Enhancing glutamate function by stimulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with glycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings provide preliminary support for further study of the antipsychotic potential of GlyT1 inhibitors."
"2068","0","The standardized psychometric assessment of altered states of consciousness (ASCs) in humans.^
The APZ questionnaire was developed in order to explore hypotheses on ASCs. First -- in a series of 11 experiments using different induction methods on N = 393 healthy subjects -- the hypothesis was tested that ASCs have major dimensions in common irrespective of the mode of their induction. In the International Study on Altered States of Consciousness (ISASC) the external validity of the experimental results was assessed. The ISASC was carried out on a total of N = 1133 subjects in six countries. The main results of the experimental studies were corroborated in the field studies. The results can be summarized as follows: the common denominator of ASCs is described by three oblique dimensions, designated as ""Oceanic Boundlessness (OSE)"", ""Dread of Ego Dissolution (AIA)"" and ""Visionary Restructuralization (VUS)"". The reliability and validity of the scales are satisfactory. Tested versions of the APZ scales are available in English (UK, USA), German, Italian and Portuguese. Psychometrically as yet untested versions exist in Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Spanish and Russian. The APZ questionnaire has become the international standard for the assessment of ASCs, thus helping to integrate research. A psychometrically improved version exists in German (OAV questionnaire). The BETA questionnaire, which measures the dimensions ""Vigilance Reduction (VIR)"" and ""Auditive Alteration (AVE)"" is also available in German. These dimensions are most likely etiology-dependent."
"9378","1","Detection of mescaline in human hair samples by UPLC-MS/MS: Application to 19 authentic forensic cases.^
Mescaline, a natural alkaloid found in the peyote cactus (Lophophora williamsii) in the Americas, has gradually become a drug of abuse in China because of its psychedelic properties. Its intake may lead to hallucinations and confusion or even be life-threatening. Mescaline is classified as a class psychotropic drug in China, which means its use in medicine or scientific research is under strict control of the government. However, studies on surveillance of mescaline abuse in the Chinese population are lacking. A rapid and sensitive liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed and validated for the determination and quantification of mescaline in hair. The method had good linearity in the range from 10 to 1000 pg/mg, with the limit of detection (LOD) of 3 pg/mg and the limit of quantitation (LOQ) of 10 pg/mg. The total runtime was 5 min. Acceptable intraday and interday precision (RSD < 15%) and accuracy (bias, −11.2% ∼ 6.8%) were achieved. The recovery was 85.0–101.0%, and the matrix effect was 92.0–105.0%. The validated method was successfully applied to 19 real forensic cases. The concentrations of mescaline in hair ranged from 10 to 784 pg/mg. The method has the benefits of simple sample preparation, high sensitivity, and short running time, making it suitable for large-scale quantitative surveillance analysis of mescaline in forensic toxicology."
"1811","1","Ayahuasca and tobacco smoking cessation: results from an online survey in Brazil.^
Rationale: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples’ experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00–1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00–4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85–0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience. Given the current burden of smoking-related disease and the limited treatment options, studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in smoking cessation."
"8028","1","Prevalence and associations of classic psychedelic-related seizures in a population-based sample.^
Objectives: Previous studies have reported links between classic psychedelic use and seizures, but little remains known about prevalence and potential risk factors of classic psychedelic-related seizures. Methods: Using a sample representative of the US adult population with regard to sex, age, and ethnicity (N = 2822), this study examined the prevalence and potential risk factors of classic psychedelic-related seizures, in a subsample of respondents who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use (n = 613). Results: Among those who reported lifetime classic psychedelic use, 1.5 % reported classic psychedelic-related seizures, a statistic that comports with the prevalence of epilepsy in the US population. Among those who reported seizures while using a classic psychedelic, almost half reported co-use of antidepressants, mood stabilizers, or opioid replacement therapies at the time of the seizures. Notably, classic psychedelic-related seizures were more commonly reported in certain respondents, especially those with a personal or family history of epilepsy. Conclusions: These results suggest that classic psychedelic use could increase the risk of seizures in certain populations, particularly those with a personal or family history of epilepsy."
"8180","1","Relationship of ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects in unipolar depression.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine and other NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists produce fast-acting antidepressant-like effects, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, two weeks clinical trial we studied the effects of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) in a group of 27 hospitalized depressive patients. RESULTS: Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen´s d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor-ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. CONCLUSION: The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. This relationship could be mediated by the initial steps of ketamine's action, trough NMDA receptors, shared by both ketamine's clinical effects."
"9309","1","Contextual influences on polydrug use among young, low-income women: Effects of neighborhood and personal networks.^
This study assessed contextual risks for polydrug use in a triethnic sample (non-Hispanic white, African American, Hispanic) of young women with a low income. For the current analysis, a total of 712 young women aged 18 to 31 years who sought care in state-funded family planning clinics in southeast Texas from December 2001 to May 2003 participated in the survey. The main outcome of the study was the number of illicit drugs (including marijuana, MDMA [ecstasy], crack cocaine, and other hard drugs) used in the last 12 months. Of the 712 subjects, 198 (28%) reported using illicit drugs in the past 12 months. Neighborhood socioeconomic status was significantly associated with drug use in a bivariate model. The proportion of women living in the most advantaged neighborhoods who reported drug use was more than twice that of women living in the most disadvantaged neighborhoods. However, the significance of neighborhood socioeconomic status was eliminated after controlling for ethnicity or for personal network characteristics in a multivariate ordinal logistic regression model. In contrast, in multivariate models, personal network indicators, such as a larger number of monthly contacts with friends (odds ratio [OR] = 1.32, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.11, 1.56) and a larger number of friends who used illicit drugs (OR = 1.47, 95% CI = 1.33, 1.62) were associated with increased drug use. In addition, not being currently married (vs. being married) (OR = 2.73, 95% CI = 1.44, 5.16) was associated with a larger number of drugs used in the last 12 months. In conclusion, we found that neighborhood socioeconomic status was not directly associated with more drug use when controlling for ethnicity or for personal network characteristics. Personal networks may mediate the relationships between neighborhood and drug use. Strategies to reduce polydrug use should target personal networks where friends use illicit drugs.

"558","1","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^
OBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted."

In a randomised double-blind trial the subjective, neuropsychological and brain activation effects of the two enantiomers of the MDMA (ecstasy-) like drug N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) were studied in five normal subjects using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). (S)-MDE produced elevated mood, impairments in conceptually driven cognition and marked right frontal activation. In contrast, (R)-MDE produced increased depression, enhanced visual feature processing, and activation of visual cortical and left frontal areas. Plasma concentrations were higher for the (R)-enantiomer. The so-called entactogenic effects of MDE are likely to be caused by the (S)-enantiomer, whereas (R)-MDE appears to be responsible for neurotoxic effects."
"7998","1","Recreational drug consumers: Who seeks treatment?.^
Background: Recreational drug consumption represents a complex issue, because of the lack of a shared definition, settings and patterns of consumptions, and poorness of evidence-based treatments. In spite of the great number of users, just few seek specific treatment, probably representing those at major risk of continuing and problematic use. The general objective of this study was to report the characteristics and main consumption patterns of recreational drug consumers treated in Regione Piemonte (Italy), in order to formulate hypotheses suitable for further research aimed at establishing more effective preventive intervention and treatment. Methods: All addiction treatment services in the region were required to fill in, for each user, a questionnaire reporting: contact of the user with the service, socio-demoghaphic data, drugs consumption and interventions/treatments. Results: Among 441 users, 70.3% were new users, 85.5% were males and the average age of consumption onset was 22 years. Psychiatric and traumatics events were present in 13.3% and in 17.9% of cases, respectively. The most frequent primary substances were cocaine (76.9%) and ecstasy (13.8%). Substances taken in association with primary drug are quoted in 75% of cases. Conclusions: The users that get in touch with services are those showing greater problems, representing, therefore, the main target for preventive public health interventions. Some interesting points can be noted: among patients treated, cocaine represents the main issue; females seem to be more sensitive to recreational drug effects; social class (education), settings and use habits are similar for recreational drugs users and heroin users. © The Author 2005.

"5378","1","Me, myself, bye: regional alterations in glutamate and the experience of ego dissolution with psilocybin.^
There is growing interest in the therapeutic utility of psychedelic substances, like psilocybin, for disorders characterized by distortions of the self-experience, like depression. Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior; however this has never been tested in humans. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we utilized an ultra-high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced region-dependent alterations in glutamate, which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one's self (ego dissolution). Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic, as well as the baseline, state.

Quantitative Electroencephalography (qEEG) and event-related potential (ERP) assessment have emerged as powerful tools to unravel translational biomarkers in preclinical and clinical psychiatric drug discovery trials. The aim of the present study was to compare the GluN2B negative allosteric modulator (NAM) traxoprodil (CP-101,606) with the unselective NMDA receptor channel blocker S-ketamine to give insight into central target engagement and differentiation on multiple EEG readouts. For qEEG recordings telemetric transmitters were implanted in male Wistar rats. Recorded EEG data were analyzed using fast Fourier transformation to determine power spectra and vigilance states. Additionally, body temperature and locomotor activity were assessed via telemetry. For recordings of auditory event-related potentials (AERP) male C57B1/6J mice were chronically implanted with deep electrodes using a tethered system. Power spectral analysis revealed a significant increase in gamma power following ketamine treatment, whereas traxoprodil (6&18 mg/kg) induced an overall decrease primarily within alpha and beta bands. Additionally, ketamine disrupted sleep and enhanced time spent in wake vigilance states, whereas traxoprodil did not alter sleep-wake architecture. AERP and mismatch negativity (MMN) revealed that ketamine (10 mg/kg) selectively disrupts auditory deviance detection, whereas traxoprodil (6 mg/kg) did not alter MMN at clinically relevant doses. In contrast to ketamine treatment, traxoprodil did not produce hyperactivity and hypothermia. In conclusion, ketamine and traxoprodil showed very different effects on diverse EEG readouts differentiating selective GluN2B antagonism from non-selective pan-NMDA-R antagonists like ketamine. These readouts are thus perfectly suited to support drug discovery efforts on NMDA-R and understanding the different functions of NMDA-R subtypes."
"4657","1","Associations between use of cocaine, amphetamines, or psychedelics and psychotic symptoms in a community sample.^
Objective: To investigate the association between use of cocaine, amphetamines, or psychedelics and psychotic symptoms. Method: Cumulated lifetime data from a prospective, longitudinal community study of 2588 adolescents and young adults in Munich, Germany, were used. Substance use at baseline, 4-year and 10-year follow-up and psychotic symptoms at 4-year and 10-year follow-up were assessed using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Data from all assessment waves were aggregated, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Additional analyses adjusted for sociodemographics, common mental disorders, other substance use, and childhood adversity (adjusted odds ratios, AOR). Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, lifetime experience of two or more psychotic symptoms was associated with lifetime use of cocaine (AOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.10-3.45) and psychedelics (AOR 2.37; 95% CI 1.20-4.66). Additionally, when mood or anxiety disorders were excluded, lifetime experience of two or more psychotic symptoms was associated with use of psychedelics (AOR 3.56; 95% CI 1.20-10.61). Conclusion: Associations between psychotic symptoms and use of cocaine, and/or psychedelics in adolescents and young adults call for further studies to elucidate risk factors and developmental pathways. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S."

Adverse life experiences such as social stress may make an individual more vulnerable to drug addiction and mental disorders associated with drug consumption. The present work aimed to evaluate the effects of stress induced by acute social defeat combined with the administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on depression-like behaviour, memory function and motor response to drug in late adolescent male mice. Two groups of mice were exposed to social defeat (SD) during four encounters with an aggressive co-specific, which took place on alternate days. Immediately after defeat, animals were treated with saline or MDMA 10 mg/kg (SD + SAL and SD + MDMA). In control groups, mice were placed in a neutral cage without an opponent (Control + SAL, Control + MDMA). Corticosterone levels and temperature were measured on the last day of this phase. During the following days, the behaviour of the animals was evaluated in the tail suspension test (an animal model of depression), memory tasks (passive avoidance and object recognition) and, after administration of 5mg/kg of MDMA, in the open-field test. Exposure of adult mice to acute social defeat plus MDMA increased immobility in the tail suspension test (depression-like behaviour), produced cognitive impairment, and reduced the motor response to MDMA. An increase in corticosterone levels and a decrease of temperature were also observed. As hypothesised, a combination of social stress and consumption of MDMA increases the risk of developing mental and cognitive disorders. Our results support the idea that stress is a common contributing factor to the high rate of comorbidity between substance abuse and mental disease.

"7009","0","Effects of ketamine optical isomers, psilocybin, psilocin and norpsilocin on time estimation and cognition in rats.^
Rationale Ketamine and psilocybin belong to the rapid-acting antidepressants but they also produce psychotomimetic effects including timing distortion. It is currently debatable whether these are essential for their therapeutic actions. As depressed patients report that the ""time is dragging,"" we hypothesized that ketamine and psilocybin-like compounds may produce an opposite effect, i.e., time underestimation, purportedly contributing to their therapeutic properties. Objectives Timing was tested following administration of (R)- and (S)-ketamine, and psilocybin, psilocin, and norpsilocin in the discrete-trial temporal discrimination task (TDT) in male rats. Timing related to premature responses, and cognitive and unspecific effects of compounds were tested in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in the standard 1-s, and ""easier"" 2-s stimulus duration conditions, as well as in the vITI variant promoting impulsive responses. Results (S)-ketamine (15 but not 3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg) shifted psychometric curve to the right in TDT and reduced premature responses in 5-CSRTT, suggesting expected time underestimation, but it also decreased the accuracy of temporal discrimination and increased response and reward latencies, decreased correct responses, and increased incorrect responses. While (R)-ketamine did not affect timing and produced no unspecific actions, it reduced incorrect responses in TDT and increased accuracy in 5-CSRTT, suggesting pro-cognitive effects. Psilocin and psilocybin produced mainly unspecific effects in both tasks, while norpsilocin showed no effects. Conclusions Time underestimation produced by (S)-ketamine could be associated with its antidepressant effects; however, it was accompanied with severe behavioral disruption. We also hypothesize that behavioral disruption produced by psychedelics objectively reflects their psychotomimetic-like actions."

Eighty-one subjects who used ayahuasca at least once in North America answered a lengthy set of open-ended questions and completed the 81-item After the Spiritual Experience Questionnaire. An additional 50 ayahuasca users were interviewed in person. The data for this study represent ayahuasca experience based on more than 2,267 ceremonies. A comparison group of 46 people attending a Catholic spiritual retreat weekend also completed the After the Spiritual Experience Questionnaire. A factor analysis of this questionnaire yielded three factors: Joy in Life, Relationship to the Sacred and Toxic Feelings. Although the ayahuasca users had significantly higher scores on the first two factors, the two groups had modest mean differences indicating a similar response to two very different spiritual experiences. This key finding strongly supports the view that ayahuasca users are engaged in an authentic process as spiritual in nature as that of the retreatants. The qualitative data revealed that ayahuasca users reduced their alcohol intake, ate healthier diets, enjoyed improved mood and greater self-acceptance and felt more loving and compassionate in their relationships. Seventy-four percent of the ayahuasca users said they had a relationship with and received ongoing guidance and support from the spirit of ayahuasca. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"5570","1","Lack of effect of sublingual salvinorin A, a naturally occurring kappa opioid, in humans: a placebo-controlled trial.^
RATIONALE: Salvinorin A (SA) is a highly selective kappa opioid receptor agonist and the putative psychoactive compound in Salvia divinorum (SD), an increasingly abused hallucinogenic plant. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the physiological and subjective effects of SA versus placebo and measure drug and metabolite levels. METHODS: Sublingual SA doses up to 4 mg were administered in dimethyl sulfoxide/polyethylene glycol 400 solution to eight SD-experienced subjects using a placebo-controlled ascending-dose design. RESULTS: No dose of SA produced significantly greater physiological or subjective effects than placebo. Furthermore, effects did not resemble reported ""typical"" effects of smoked SD. SA was detectable in plasma and urine, but was, in most cases, below the reliable limit of quantification (0.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the sublingual bioavailability of SA is low. Higher doses, alternate formulations, or alternate routes of administration will be necessary to study the effects of SA in humans."
"5540","0","Pharmacological modulation of the effects of subanaesthetic ketamine: A review.^
The similarity between ketamine effects and endogenous psychoses has created interest in the capacity of antipsychotic medications to block ketamine effects. In healthy subjects, a subanaesthetic single dose of lorazepam, typical neuroleptics, such as haloperidol, and atypical neuroleptics, such as clozapine and olanzapine, failed to block ketamine-induced positive and negative symptoms resembling schizophrenia. However, haloperidol is able to decrease ketamine-induced impairment in executive cognitive functions. Recently, lamotrigine reduced ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and cognitive impairments. In schizophrenic subjects, single doses of olanzapine do not decrease the effects of ketamine. However, long term treatment with clozapine has been reported to decrease ketamine-induced positive symptoms. Pharmacological modulation of the effects of NMDA receptor antagonists, such as ketamine, may lead to development of novel therapeutic agents for psychiatric illnesses such as schizophrenia."
"2205","1","The Effects of Daytime Psilocybin Administration on Sleep: Implications for Antidepressant Action.^
Serotonergic agonist psilocybin is a psychedelic with antidepressant potential. Sleep may interact with psilocybin's antidepressant properties like other antidepressant drugs via induction of neuroplasticity. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of psilocybin on sleep architecture on the night after psilocybin administration. Regarding the potential antidepressant properties, we hypothesized that psilocybin, similar to other classical antidepressants, would reduce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and prolong REM sleep latency. Moreover, we also hypothesized that psilocybin would promote slow-wave activity (SWA) expression in the first sleep cycle, a marker of sleep-related neuroplasticity. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, age 28-53) underwent two drug administration sessions, psilocybin or placebo, in a randomized, double-blinded design. Changes in sleep macrostructure, SWA during the first sleep cycle, whole night EEG spectral power across frequencies in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, and changes in subjective sleep measures were analyzed. The results revealed prolonged REM sleep latency after psilocybin administration and a trend toward a decrease in overall REM sleep duration. No changes in NREM sleep were observed. Psilocybin did not affect EEG power spectra in NREM or REM sleep when examined across the whole night. However, psilocybin suppressed SWA in the first sleep cycle. No evidence was found for sleep-related neuroplasticity, however, a different dosage, timing, effect on homeostatic regulation of sleep, or other mechanisms related to antidepressant effects may play a role. Overall, this study suggests that potential antidepressant properties of psilocybin might be related to changes in sleep."

In the past decade, an increasing number of clinical trials are reporting evidence that psychedelics or serotonergic hallucinogens (such as lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and ayahuasca/dimethyltryptamine) could be effective in the treatment of mood, anxiety, and substance use disorders. The mechanisms responsible for these effects are not fully understood but seem to involve changes in bran dynamics in areas rich in serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors and in personality. In the present text, we present a brief and critical overview of the current research in this field, pointing out both promises and limitations of these studies."
"3647","1","Impairment of specific episodic memory processes by sub-psychotic doses of ketamine: The effects of levels of processing at encoding and of the subsequent retrieval task.^
Rationale: The precise nature of the impact of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, ketamine, upon human episodic memory, has yet to be elucidated fully. Objectives: This study sought to assess the effects of ketamine on the sub-processes facilitating memory encoding and retrieval. Methods: We evaluated the effects of the drug on a series of memory performance measures depending upon whether it was administered at the encoding or retrieval stage and on the nature of the encoding task used. Twelve healthy volunteers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subjects study. Intravenous infusions of placebo, 50 ng/ml ketamine or 100 ng/ml ketamine were administered. We investigated the effects of ketamine on three key aspects of episodic memory: encoding vs retrieval processes, source memory, and depth of processing. Data were analysed using both multinomial modelling and standard measures of item discrimination and response bias. Results: Deleterious effects of ketamine on episodic memory were primarily attributable to its effects on encoding, rather than retrieval processes. Recognition memory was impaired for items encoded at an intermediate level of processing, but preserved for shallowly and deeply encoded items. Increased source guessing bias was also observed when encoding took place under ketamine. Conclusions: The effects of ketamine upon episodic memory seem, therefore, to predominate at encoding. Furthermore, our results are also consistent with a specific impairment of encoding processes that result in subsequent recollective, as opposed to familiarity-based, retrieval. The observed effects are compatible with memory deficits seen in schizophrenia and thus provide some support for the ketamine model of the disease.

Approximately 10% of the U.S. population 12 years and older reported using illicit substances in 2015. This article reviews the clinical effects and treatment of persons who use cocaine, methamphetamines, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), synthetic cannabinoids, and synthetic cathinones (“bath salts”). Cocaine blocks the reuptake of the monoamine transporters dopamine, norepinephrine, and serotonin. Immediate clinical effects include increased energy and euphoria, as well as hypertension and arrhythmias. Acute myocardial infarction, seizures, hallucinations, hyperthermia, and movement disorders are among the possible adverse effects. Like cocaine, methamphetamine blocks reuptake of monoamine transporters, but also stimulates dopamine release and has a longer duration of action. Methamphetamine misuse is associated with severe dental problems. MDMA is a stimulant and psychedelic with a chemical structure similar to serotonin. Adverse effects include serotonin syndrome, hyponatremia, long-term memory impairment, and mood disorders. Synthetic cannabinoids can have a more intense and long-lasting effect than natural cannabis. Acute intoxication may cause severe cardiac and respiratory complications and seizures. Synthetic cathinones are marketed as cheap substitutes for other stimulants. Their effects are similar to those of other stimulants, and they are addictive. Psychosocial intervention is the main form of treatment for addiction to these substances. Promising therapies include disulfiram and substitution therapy for cocaine misuse disorders, and mirtazapine for methamphetamine use disorder."

"7386","1","Estimated lifetime drug use, impulsivity, and psychopathology in recreational ecstasy users.^
Previous research suggests elevated levels of impulsivity and psychopathology in recreational ecstasy users. However, most recreational ecstasy users tend to be poly-drug users. The present study aimed to investigate impulsivity and psychopathology in a sample of recreational ecstasy polydrug users compared with samples of non-ecstasy users, while statistically controlling for estimated life-time drug usage. Sixty-eight non-drug controls, 79 non-ecstasy poly-drug users, 11 'light' ecstasy poly-drug users, and 47 'heavy' ecstasy poly drug users completed the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and the SCL-90R and a drug history questionnaire. When estimated life-time drug-use was statistically controlled for, heavy ecstasy users exhibited significantly higher levels of non-planning and cognitive impulsivity, and increased obsessive compulsion, anxiety and positive symptom total than non-ecstasy users. This study provides evidence of some elements of elevated impulsivity and psychopathology in heavy ecstasy users, but not in lighter ecstasy users. The results should be seen in the context of the heavy ecstasy group as poly-drug users and should be interpreted with caution. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd."

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-informed regimen, we conducted an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to systematically investigate the effects of psilocybin in cluster headache. BACKGROUND: Sustained reductions in cluster headache burden after limited quantities of psilocybin-containing mushrooms are anecdotally reported, although to date there are no controlled studies investigating these effects. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) in a pulse of three doses, each ~5 days apart. Participants maintained headache diaries starting 2 weeks before and continuing through 8 weeks after the first drug session. A total of 16 participants were randomized to receive experimental drug and 14 were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: In the 3 weeks after the start of the pulse regimen, the change in cluster attack frequency was 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 2.6) attacks/week with placebo (baseline 8.9 [95% CI 3.8 to 14.0]) and -3.2 (95% CI -8.3 to 1.9) attacks/week with psilocybin (baseline 9.6 [95% CI 5.6 to 13.6]; p = 0.251). Group difference in change from baseline had a moderate effect size (d = 0.69). The effect size was small in episodic participants (d = 0.35) but large in chronic participants (d = 1.25), which remained over the entire 8-week period measured (d = 0.81). Changes in cluster attack frequency were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during psilocybin administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated without any unexpected or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this initial, exploratory study provide valuable information for the development of larger, more definitive studies. Efficacy outcomes were negative, owing in part to the small number of participants. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects underscores the need for further investigation into the mechanism(s) of action of psilocybin in headache disorders."

While anecdotal reports claim that psychedelic microdosing reduces anxiety and mood symptoms, evidence supporting these claims is scarce. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between microdosing and trait anxiety. Furthermore, it was investigated if trait mindfulness mediated this association. Participants completed anonymous online questionnaires and were divided into three groups: current microdosers (n = 186), former microdosers (n = 77) and microdosing-naïve controls (n = 234). Trait anxiety and trait mindfulness were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory–Trait subscale (STAI-T) and the 15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15) respectively. Current and former microdosers reported lower STAI-T scores compared to microdosing-naïve controls. Furthermore, associations of current and former microdosing with trait anxiety were mediated by trait mindfulness, with small effects of FFMQ-15 Total, Non-judging and Non-reactivity scores. However, in an exploratory analysis, all associations between microdosing and STAI-T scores became non-significant when participants with previous macrodose experience (n = 386) were excluded. Our findings suggest that RCT<apos;>s are warranted to test causal hypotheses concerning the effects of microdosing and the role of trait mindfulness in the effects of microdosing, while controlling for previous macrodose experience."
"3984","0","Ketamine as anesthetic agent in electroconvulsion therapy.^
Background: Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a well-established, safe and effective treatment for severe psychiatric disorders. Ketamine is known as a core medication in anesthesiology and has recently gained interest in ECT practice as there are three potential advantages: (1) ketamine has no anticonvulsive actions, (2) according to recent studies ketamine could possess a unique intrinsic antidepressive potential and (3) ketamine may exhibit neuroprotective properties, which again might reduce the risk of cognitive side effects associated with ECT. Objectives: The use of ketamine in psychiatric patients has been controversially discussed due to its dose-dependent psychotropic and psychotomimetic effects. This study was carried out to test if the occurrence of side effects is comparable and if seizure quality is better with ketamine when compared to thiopental. Material and methods: This retrospective study analyzed a total of 199 patients who received ketamine anesthesia for a total of 2178 ECT sessions. This cohort was compared to patients who were treated with thiopental for 1004 ECT sessions. Results and discussion: A repeated measurement multiple logistic regression analysis revealed significant advantages in the ketamine group for seizure concordance and postictal suppression (both are surrogates for central inhibition). S-ketamin also necessitated the use of a higher dose of urapidil and a higher maximum postictal heart frequency. Clinically relevant psychiatric side effects were rare in both groups. No psychiatric side effects occurred in the subgroup of patients with schizophrenia (ketamine: n = 30). The mean dose of S-ketamine used increased in the first years but stabilized at 63 mg per patient in 2014. From these experiences it can be concluded that S-ketamine can be recommended at least as a safe alternative to barbiturates."

Background: The study's objective was to examine the effects of ""real-world,"" community-based implementation of universal preventive interventions selected from a menu, including effects specific to higher- and lower-risk subsamples. Design: School districts were selected based on size and location, and then randomly assigned to a control condition or to an experimental condition in a cohort sequential design. Setting/Participants: The study included 28 public school districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania that were located in rural towns and small cities, ranging in size from 6975 to 44,510. Sixth and seventh graders in these school districts participated in the study. Intervention: Community teams were mobilized; each team implemented one of three evidence-based, family-focused interventions (5 to 12 sessions) and one of three evidence-based school interventions (11 to 15 sessions), for 6th and 7th graders, respectively. Observations showed that interventions were implemented with fidelity. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes included student reports of past month, past year, and lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, methamphetamines, ecstasy, and inhalants, as well as indices of gateway and illicit substance initiation, at pretest and at a follow-up assessment 18 months later. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated significant effects on substance initiation (marijuana, inhalants, methamphetamines, ecstasy, gateway index, illicit-use index), as well as past-year use of marijuana and inhalants, with positive trends for all substances measured. For three outcomes, intervention effects were stronger for higher-risk students than lower-risk students. Conclusions: Community-based implementation of brief universal interventions designed for general populations has potential for public health impact by reducing substance use among adolescents. © 2007 American Journal of Preventive Medicine."

SPSS- version 13 was employed to conduct analysis through chi-square, fisher's exact test and logistic regression methods. Results: The prevalence of ecstasy use was 2.3% (95%CI: 1.7-2.9%). Party was the most prevalent place of first use (65%) and access was easy for most users (63%). In multivariate analysis, smoking (P-V=0.005), alcohol use (P-V=003), use of other substances (P-V<0.001), being in relationship with boys (P-V=0.015), families without one or two parents (P-V=0.020), night spending at friends home without parents' permission (PV= 0.001) were associated with ecstasy use. Conclusion: Due to relation of ecstasy use with other substances, designed programmes should be comprehensive, with different strategies and collaboration of several sectors. The main strategies are to improve students' health literacy, family support, to limit supply and access, and to legislate appropriate regulatory laws."

METHODS: In an open label trial, a 55-year-old male patient with treatment-resistant major depression and a co-occurring alcohol and benzodiazepine dependence received two intravenous infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine over the course of 6 weeks. Depression severity was assessed by means of a weekly clinical interview, the 21-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS), and the 21-item Beck Depression Inventory (BDI). RESULTS: The first ketamine infusion lead to a pronounced improvement of symptoms, peaking on the second day post infusion (HDRS -56.6%, BDI -65.4%). Positive effects started fading by day 7, reaching baseline by day 35. The second infusion was less efficacious: HDRS and BDI were reduced by 43 and 35%, respectively, and returned to baseline by day 7. CONCLUSION: In this patient with a co-occurring substance use disorder, repeated administrations of ketamine produced positive results. Since the second application has been less efficacious, doses and schedule of administrations need to be further investigated."
"8584","0","The impact of cannabis use on age of onset and clinical characteristics in first-episode psychotic patients. Data from the Psychosis Incident Cohort Outcome Study (PICOS).^
Cannabis use is frequent among first-episode psychosis (FEP) patients and has been associated with several clinical features. This study aimed in an FEP sample to determine whether cannabis use is associated with (1) a higher level of positive symptoms, a lower level of depression and a better premorbid adjustment, (2) an earlier age of onset, and a better premorbid IQ. The study was conducted within the framework of the Psychosis Incident Cohort Outcome Study (PICOS), a multisite collaborative research on FEP patients who attended the psychiatric services in Veneto Region, Italy. Standardized instruments were used to collect sociodemographic, clinical, and drug use data. A total of 555 FEP patients met the inclusion criteria, 517 of whom received an ICD-10 diagnosis of psychosis; 397 (55% males; mean age: 32 yrs ± 9.5) were assessed. Out of these, 311 patients agreed to be interviewed on drug and alcohol misuse; 20.3% was positive for drug misuse: cannabis (19.0%), cocaine (3.9%), and hallucinogens (3.9%). Cannabis use was not associated with a higher level of positive symptoms, but correlated with less severe depressive symptoms. No relationship was observed between premorbid adjustment or IQ and cannabis use. FEP patients who used cannabis had an earlier age of onset than abstinent patients, even after adjusting for gender and diagnosis. Our results suggest a possible causal role of cannabis in triggering psychosis in certain vulnerable subjects. Particular attention must be paid to this behaviour, because reducing cannabis use can delay or prevent some cases of psychosis."
"1482","1","Brain volume in chronic ketamine users - relationship to sub-threshold psychotic symptoms and relevance to schizophrenia.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine may model aspects of schizophrenia arising through NMDA receptor activity deficits. Although acute ketamine can induce effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, chronic use may be a closer model of idiopathic psychosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that ketamine users had lower brain volumes, as measured using MRI, and greater sub-threshold psychotic symptoms relative to a poly-drug user control group. METHODS: Ketamine users (n = 17) and poly-drug using controls (n = 19) were included in the study. All underwent volumetric MRI imaging and measurement of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Freesurfer was used to analyse differences in regional brain volume, cortical surface area and thickness between ketamine users and controls. The relationship between CAARMS ratings and brain volume was also investigated in ketamine users. RESULTS: Ketamine users were found to have significantly lower grey matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and total cortex (FDR p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.36-0.75). Within the cortex, ketamine users had significantly lower grey matter volumes within the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices (Cohen's d 0.7-1.31; FDR p < 0.05). They also had significantly higher sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (p < 0.05). Frequency of ketamine use showed an inverse correlation with cerebellar volume (p < 0.001), but there was no relationship between regional brain volumes and sub-threshold psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ketamine use may cause lower grey matter volumes as well as inducing sub-threshold psychotic symptoms, although these likely arise through distinct mechanisms."
"3100","1","Psychological effects of (S)-ketamine and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT): a double-blind, cross-over study in healthy volunteers.^
INTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type."
"8348","0","Cerebral blood flow and cognitive function in HIV-infected men with sustained suppressed viremia on combination antiretroviral therapy.^
Objective: To assess if HIV-infected patients on long-term successful combination antiretroviral therapy show cerebral blood flow (CBF) alterations in comparison with HIV-uninfected, otherwise similar controls. To explore whether such alterations are associated with HIV-associated cognitive impairment and to explore potential determinants of CBF alterations in HIV. Design: Cross-sectional comparison of CBF in an observational cohort study. Methods: Clinical, cognitive and MRI data of 100 middle-aged aviremic HIV-infected men on combination antiretroviral therapy and 69 HIV-uninfected controls were collected and compared. From pseudocontinuous arterial spin labeling MRI data, CBF-maps were calculated. The associations of mean gray matter CBF with clinical and cognitive parameters were explored in regression models, followed by a spatial delineation in a voxel-based analysis. Results: CBF was decreased in HIV-infected patients compared with HIV-uninfected controls (P=0.02), adjusted for age, ecstasy use and waist circumference. Spatially distinct and independent effects of total gray matter volume and HIV-serostatus on CBF were found. Within the HIV-infected group, decreased CBF was associated with increased triglyceride levels (P=0.005) and prior clinical AIDS (P=0.03). No association between CBF and cognitive impairment was found. Conclusion: Decreased CBF was observed among HIV-infected patients, which was associated with both vascular risk factors as well as with measures of past immune deficiency. These results provide support for increased vascular disease in HIV-infected patients as represented by hemodynamic alteration, but without overt cognitive consequences within the current cohort of patients on long-term successful treatment."
"9067","0","CR845, a novel peripherally-acting kappa opioid receptor agonist, has low abuse potential compared with pentazocine.^
CR845, a potent, peripherally‐acting, selective kappa opioid receptor agonist, is being developed for the treatment of acute and chronic pain. This study examined the relative abuse potential of CR845 compared to placebo or pentazocine, a schedule IV opioid analgesic. Recreational polydrug users with experience with opioids and hallucinogenic agents were enrolled in this single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, active‐ and placebo‐controlled study. Thirty‐nine subjects received a single bolus IV dose of the following 4 treatments in random order: CR845 5 mcg/kg (therapeutic dose), CR845 15 mcg/kg (supra‐therapeutic dose), placebo, and pentazocine 0.5 mg/kg. Treatments were separated by 48‐hour washout period. Drug liking bipolar Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was the primary measurement, and was assessed periodically between 5 minutes and 8 hours after dosing. This trial met the primary endpoint with drug liking scores for pentazocine significantly greater than that of placebo and either doses of CR845 (P<0.0001 for each comparison to pentazocine). The least squares (LS) mean for the maximum drug liking VAS (Emax) scores (6standard error of LS mean) were 87.6±1.9 for pentazocine, 65.3±1.9 for CR845 5 mcg/kg, 66.9±1.9 for CR845 15 mcg/kg, and 52.4±1.9 for placebo, indicating that both doses of CR845 had significantly lower drug liking response compared to pentazocine. Additional bipolar VAS measurements were lower for CR845 compared with pentazocine for ''overall drug liking'' (P<0.0001 for both doses of CR845) and ''take drug again'' (P<0.0003 for CR845 5 mcg/kg and P<0.0001 for CR845 15 mcg/kg). These VAS scores for CR845 were equivalent for both doses and were similar to those of placebo. These results suggest that the novel and selective peripherally acting kappa agonist CR845 may present a low risk for abuse liability in humans. Sponsored by Cara Therapeutics."
"9503","1","Co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against challenging experiences and enhance positive experiences.^
Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) experiences can range from very positive to highly challenging (e.g., fear, grief, and paranoia). These challenging experiences contribute to hesitancy toward psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy among health care providers and patients. Co-use of 3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) with psilocybin/LSD anecdotally reduces challenging experiences and enhances positive experiences associated with psilocybin/LSD. However, limited research has investigated the acute effects of co-use of MDMA and psilocybin/LSD. In a prospective convenience sample (N = 698) of individuals with plans to use psilocybin/LSD, we examined whether co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (n = 27) is associated with differences in challenging or positive experiences. Challenging experiences were measured using the Challenging Experiences Questionnaire and positive experiences were measured using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and single-item measures of self-compassion, compassion, love, and gratitude. Potentially confounding variables were identified and included as covariates. Relative to psilocybin/LSD alone, co-use of psilocybin/LSD with a self-reported low (but not medium-high) dose of MDMA was associated with significantly less intense total challenging experiences, grief, and fear, as well as increased self-compassion, love and gratitude. Co-use of psilocybin/LSD and MDMA was not associated with differences in mystical-type experiences or compassion. Findings suggest co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against some aspects of challenging experiences and enhance certain positive experiences. Limitations include use of a convenience sample, small sample size, and non-experimental design. Additional studies (including controlled dose-response studies) that examine the effects and safety of co-administering MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (in healthy controls and clinical samples) are warranted and may assist the development of personalized treatments."
"7124","1","Psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition are attenuated by ketanserin in healthy human volunteers.^
The serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related inhibitory gating and behavioral inhibition deficits of schizophrenia patients. The hallucinogen psilocybin disrupts automatic forms of sensorimotor gating and response inhibition in humans, but it is unclear so far whether the 5-HT(2A)R or 5-HT(1A)R agonist properties of its bioactive metabolite psilocin account for these effects. Thus, we investigated whether psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition in healthy humans could be attenuated by the 5-HT(2A/2C)R antagonist ketanserin. A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo, ketanserin (40 mg p.o.), psilocybin (260 μg/kg p.o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced order. Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (5D-ASC), and the Color-Word Stroop Test. Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals (30 ms), increased all 5D-ASC scores, and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test. Stroop interference and Stroop effect of the response latencies were increased under psilocybin as well. Psilocybin-induced alterations were attenuated by ketanserin pretreatment, whereas ketanserin alone had no significant effects. These findings suggest that the disrupting effects of psilocybin on automatic and controlled inhibition processes are attributable to 5-HT(2A)R stimulation. Sensorimotor gating and attentional control deficits of schizophrenia patients might be due to changes within the 5-HT(2A)R system."
"1139","1","Ketamine-induced changes in resting state connectivity, 2 h after the drug administration in patients with remitted depression.^
BACKGROUND: Resting state connectivity studies link ketamine's antidepressant effects with normalisation of the brain connectivity changes that are observed in depression. These changes, however, usually co-occur with improvement in depressive symptoms, making it difficult to attribute these changes to ketamine's effects per se. AIMS: Our aim is to examine the effects of ketamine in brain connectivity, 2 h after its administration in a cohort of volunteers with remitted depression. Any significant changes observed in this study could provide insight of ketamine's antidepressant mechanism as they are not accompanied by symptom changes. METHODS: In total, 35 participants with remitted depression (21 females, mean age = 28.5 years) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. Resting state scans were acquired approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion. Brain connectivity was examined using a seed-based approach (ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)) and a brain network analysis (independent component analysis). RESULTS: Decreased connectivity between the sgACC and the amygdala was observed approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion, compared to placebo (p(FWE) < 0.05). The executive network presented with altered connectivity with different cortical and subcortical regions. Within the network, the left hippocampus and right amygdala had decreased connectivity (p(FWE) < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a model whereby ketamine would change the connectivity of brain areas and networks that are important for cognitive processing and emotional regulation. These changes could also be an indirect indicator of the plasticity changes induced by the drug."
"5741","1","[Reliability and validity of self-reported drug use among secondary school students].^
OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and validity of self-reported use among secondary school students. METHOD: Validity was assessed in a representative sample of nearly 1,300 students by analyzing: a) the proportion of questions on drug use left unanswered compared with that for other questions; b) the proportion of inconsistencies between related questions; c) the proportion of questions wrongly completed; d) admision of ficticious drug use; e) the relationship between self-reported drug use and that of friends', and f) willingness to admit cannabis and ecstasy use. Reliability was analyzed using the kappa index, the proportion of specific agreement, and the intra-class correlation coefficient in a test-retest procedure in a randomized subsample of 349 students. RESULTS: The response rate to questions on drug use was high and was similar to that for more neutral questions. Only 0,3% of the secondary school students reported having used a fictitious drug. Except in the case of heroin, individual drug use was directly related to friends' perception of consumption. A very low proportion of students would not be willing to admit to use of cannabis (2%) or ecstasy (3,4%). Questions referring to drug use at some time during students' lives showed greater reliability than those referring to more recent drug use (last 12 months). The kappa indexes for drug consumption at some time during students lives ranged from 0.65 to 0.87, except for ecstasy and LSD (0.51 and 0.52 respectively). The age of first drug consumption was highly reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.71 to 1). CONCLUSIONS: Except for ectasy, amphetamines and LSD, indexes of reliability and validity were generally good and similar to those obtained in other studies. These findings support the idea that information about self-reported drug use obtained through a questionnaire is reliable and valid, although the absolute prevalences of the use of some drugs should be interpreted with caution. The indicator of consumption at some time during students' lives is especially useful in studies monitoring drug use among this population."
"387","1","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist effects on prefrontal cortical connectivity better model early than chronic schizophrenia.^
BACKGROUND: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) function contributes to schizophrenia onset and progression. However, little is known about neural mechanisms behind PFC functional alterations along illness stages. Recent pharmacologic studies indicate that glutamate dysfunction may produce increased functional connectivity. However, pharmacologic models of schizophrenia overlook effects of illness progression on PFC function. This study compared N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist effects in healthy volunteers with stages of schizophrenia with respect to PFC functional connectivity. METHODS: First, we tested ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity in healthy volunteers in a data-driven way (n = 19). Next, we compared healthy subjects (n = 96) with three clinical groups: individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (n = 21), people early in their course of schizophrenia (EC-SCZ) (n = 28), and patients with chronic illness (n = 20). Across independent analyses, we used data-driven global brain connectivity techniques restricted to PFC to identify functional dysconnectivity. RESULTS: Results revealed robust PFC hyperconnectivity in healthy volunteers administered ketamine (Cohen's d = 1.46), resembling individuals at high risk for schizophrenia and EC-SCZ. Hyperconnectivity was not found in patients with chronic illness relative to EC-SCZ patients. Results provide the first evidence that ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity resemble early course but not chronic schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest an illness phase-specific relevance of NMDAR antagonist administration for prefrontal dysconnectivity associated with schizophrenia. This finding has implications for the neurobiology of illness progression and for the widespread use of NMDAR antagonists in the development of therapeutics for schizophrenia."
"7078","1","A Novel, Brief, Fully Automated Intervention to Extend the Antidepressant Effect of a Single Ketamine Infusion: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^
OBJECTIVE: Intravenous ketamine, which displays rapid antidepressant properties, is posited to reverse depression by rapidly enhancing neuroplasticity. The authors tested whether an automated, computer-based approach could efficiently leverage enhanced neuroplasticity to extend the durability of rapid clinical response. METHODS: A total of 154 adults (ages 18-60) with treatment-resistant unipolar depression were randomized in a double-blind, parallel-arm design to receive an active/active treatment combination (ketamine plus active ""automated self-association training"" [ASAT]; N=53) or one of two control arms that lacked either the active drug component (saline plus active ASAT; N=51) or the active behavioral component (ketamine plus sham ASAT; N=50). One day after a single infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or inert placebo (saline), active ASAT-targeting self-worth through automated ""evaluative conditioning"" training delivered by computer-or sham ASAT (consisting of identical computer tasks that included no positive or self-referential stimuli) was given, delivered twice daily over 4 consecutive days (eight sessions, ≤20 minutes per session). The prespecified primary outcome measure throughout the main (30-day) study period was score on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). RESULTS: Ketamine rapidly and significantly reduced depression scores at 24 hours postinfusion (group-by-time interaction: standardized beta [β]=-1.30, 95% CI=-1.89, -0.70; t=-4.29, df=150). In intent-to-treat linear mixed models, depression scores in the ketamine+ASAT group remained significantly and stably low over the 30-day study period relative to those of the saline+ASAT group (β=-0.61, 95% CI=-0.95, -0.28; t=-3.62, df=148). By contrast, depression scores following ketamine+sham treatment followed a significant, increasing linear trajectory from 24 hours to 30 days, approaching the levels observed in the saline+ASAT group (group-by-time interaction relative to the saline+ASAT group: β=0.015, 95% CI=0.003, 0.03; t=2.35, df=568). CONCLUSIONS: After priming the brain with ketamine, training positive self-associations could provide an efficient, low-cost, portable, noninvasive, and highly dissemination-ready strategy for leveraging and extending ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."

Objective: Methylone (3,4‐methylenedioxymethcathinone) is a synthetic cathinone that became popular as a nonillegal substitute of ecstasy (MDMA) due to its similar profile of desirable effects. This pilot study aims to obtain preliminary data on the acute pharmacological effects of methylone in comparison to MDMA and placebo, and to define the selected doses for future investigations. Material and/or methods: A double‐blind, placebocontrolled, crossover and randomized (lower doses were allocated previous to the higher dose) clinical trial in recreational stimulant consumers was carried out. The study consists of four cohorts, including three participants in each cohort (N = 12); in the first three cohorts, oral doses of methylone (50‐200 mg) were administered in comparison to placebo and in the 4th cohort, 200 mg of methylone were compared to 100 mg of MDMA and placebo. Study variables included: vital signs, Maddox wing device, psychomotor performance (Simple Reaction Time), subjective effects (visual analogue scales (VAS), ARCI‐49 item short form, VESSPA) measured over 10 h. Samples of blood, urine, oral fluid and sweat were collected to determine methylone concentrations. Results: Methylone at doses from 100 to 200 mg produced dose‐related cardiovascular effects and induced stimulant and euphorigenic effects, as reflected in VAS “stimulated,” “high” and ARCI‐MBG scale. Methylone 200 mg produced higher cardiovascular effects than MDMA 100 mg, although their subjective effects related to stimulation and wellbeing were of similar intensity. Conclusions: Methylone administered at doses from 100 to 200 mg induced sympathomimetic and euphorigenic effects following a dose‐response relationship. The profile of pharmacological effects induced by 200 mg of methylone was comparable to that of 100 mg of MDMA."

We report the findings of a randomised controlled triple-blind pilot study of intraoperative ketamine infusion combined with spinal anaesthesia on the prevalence of persisting post surgical pain following total knee arthroplasty surgery. Twelve patients were randomised to receive either ketamine or placebo in association with spinal anaesthesia for total knee arthroplasty. All patients also received general anaesthesia. More patients were pain-free at six months in the ketamine group (three of five) compared to the control group (two of seven). Perioperative data collected during the study suggested that the addition of intraoperative ketamine might also improve the quality of recovery. Although no statistical analysis was undertaken due to the small numbers, these preliminary findings suggest that the use of intraoperative systemic ketamine in association with spinal anaesthesia for the reduction of persisting post surgical pain deserves further study."

This study measured use of club drugs among 262 Hispanic men who have sex with men (MSM) recruited at community venues in Miami-Dade County, Florida in 2001. More than 50% of men used club drugs, and 36% used them in the last 3 months. Lifetime and 3-month rates were: ecstasy (36% and 20%), cocaine (34% and 12%), amyl nitrates (28% and 9%), and crystal methamphetamine (20% and 15%). Thirty-six percent had used two or more drugs (polydrug use) in their lifetime and 20% reported polydrug use in the last 3 months. Club drug users had significantly more sex partners in the last 12 months than nonclub drug users. High rates (35%) of unprotected anal sex in the last 3 months were reported by both groups. Men who reported polydrug use in the last 3 months were significantly more likely than men who used a single club drug to have had sex under the influence of club drugs (83% vs. 57%; X2= 7.4, p = 0.006). At the multivariate level, a significant association between preference for use of English and lifetime club drug use emerged. Effective interventions to reduce club drug use and risky sex for Hispanic MSM are needed. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc."
"979","1","Evaluation of Early Ketamine Effects on Belief-Updating Biases in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
IMPORTANCE: Clinical research has shown that persistent negative beliefs maintain depression and that subanesthetic ketamine infusions induce rapid antidepressant responses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ketamine alters belief updating and how such cognitive effects are associated with the clinical effects of ketamine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used an observational case-control protocol with a mixed-effects design that nested 2 groups by 2 testing time points. Observers were not blinded. Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and healthy volunteer participants aged 34 to 68 years were included. Patients with TRD were diagnosed with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression, had a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score greater than 20, a Maudsley Staging Method score greater than 7, and failed to respond to at least 2 prior antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria were any other psychiatric, neurological, or neurosurgical comorbidities, substance use or addictive disorders, and recreational ketamine consumption. Data were collected from January to February 2019 and from May to December 2019, and data were analyzed from January 2020 to July 2021. EXPOSURES: Patients with TRD were observed 24 hours before single ketamine infusion, 4 hours after the infusion, and 4 hours after the third infusion, which was 1 week after the first infusion. Healthy control participants were observed twice 1 week apart without ketamine exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score and belief updating after belief updating when patients received good news and bad news measured by a cognitive belief-updating task and mathematically formalized by a computational reinforcement learning model. RESULTS: Of 56 included participants, 29 (52%) were male, and the mean (SEM) age was 52.3 (1.2) years. A total of 26 patients with TRD and 30 control participants were included. A significant group × testing time point × news valence interaction showed that patients with TRD updated their beliefs more after good than bad news following a single ketamine infusion (controlled for age and education: β = -0.91; 95% CI, -1.58 to -0.24; t216 = -2.67; P = .008) than controls. Computational modeling showed that this effect was associated with asymmetrical learning rates (LRs) after ketamine treatment (good news LRs after ketamine, 0.51 [SEM, 0.04]; bad news LRs after ketamine 0.36 [SEM, 0.03], t25 = 3.8; P < .001) and partially mediated early antidepressant responses (path a*b: β = -1.00 [SEM, 0.66]; t26 = -1.53; z = -1.98; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings provide novel insights into the cognitive mechanisms of the action of ketamine in patients with TRD, with promising perspectives for augmented psychotherapy for individuals with mood disorders."

Background: Salvia divinorum, a hallucinogenic herb, has in recent years become popular among teenagers and young adults. Salvia is presently marketed as a ""legal"" alternative to other drugs of abuse, but little is known about the clinical toxicity of this substance. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to describe the clinical and demographic features of this emerging substance of recreational abuse using data obtained from the records of a poison control center. Methods: We performed retrospective review of exposures to the herbal hallucinogen Salvia divinorum as reported to the California Poison Control System (CPCS) over the last 10 years. Demographic and clinical data were collected and compiled from the computerized records of the CPCS for the search terms ""salvia"" and ""sage."" Results: There were 37 exposures to S. divinorum and 96 exposures to non-hallucinogenic Salvia species. Eighteen (49%) of the exposures were to S. divinorum alone. Intentional Salvia exposures resulted in a variety of neurologic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects. Notably, the use of concomitant substances of abuse was associated with a high rate of complications and psychomotor disturbances. Conclusions: Intentional use of S. divinorum, whether alone or in combination with alcoholic beverages and other drugs, causes neurologic, cardiovascular, and gastrointestinal effects. This poison-center-based review helps to characterize the clinical toxicity of S. divinorum, but more clinical and pharmacologic research is warranted for this rapidly emerging substance of abuse. © 2011 Elsevier Inc."
"6189","1","LSD Base and LSD Tartrate Bioequivalence and Bioavailability in Healthy Subjects.^
LSD is widely used for recreational and spiritual purposes. Additionally LSD is currently reused in experimental studies with healthy subjects and in studies investigating its effects on patients suffering from anxiety, depression, addiction personality disorders, cluster headache, migraine, and other pathological conditions. When LSD is used recreationally, it is administered mostly in the form of LSD tartrate on filter paper (blotter) or as a liquid. In experimental research over the past years, LSD has mostly been used in the form of LSD base, which is lipophilic and therefore has typically been administered as a solution in ethanol. However, some researchers have also use LSD tartrate orally or LSD base intravenously. Currently, it is not clear how these different forms of LSD compare regarding their bioequivalence and effects. The present study therefore compares four different formulations of LSD and placebo: (1) An oral drinking solution of LSD base currently used in many research studies (100 μg LSD in 96% ethanol), (2) A solid orodispersible film containing LSD base (100 μg LSD), (3) LSD tartrate used in research and recreationally (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), (4) an intravenous administration of LSD tartrate (100 μg LSD equivalent of LSD tartrate in water), and (5) placebo for all formulations (quadruple‐dummy). The primary goals are to document the bioequivalence of LSD base (1) and tartrate (3) and to define the oral bioavailability of LSD using an additional intravenous LSD administration."

Fibromyalgia (FM) is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition for which there is strong interest in alternative treatments. There is growing interest in the potential of psychedelic substances (e.g., psilocybin) in conjunction with psychotherapy to treat chronic pain. Via a cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey, we aimed to characterize knowledge, perceptions, and past use of serotonergic (""classic"") and non-serotonergic psychedelics among a population of individuals with FM, and to investigate interest in psychedelic-based FM treatments. Among a North American population of 354 participants with FM, 29.9% reported past use of a psychedelic, with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms being most commonly used. Perceptions of benefit from psychedelic use were generally neutral (59.4%) or positive (36.8%), with <3% reporting negative impacts on overall health or pain symptoms. Among 12 participants who used psychedelics with intentions of treating chronic pain, 11 reported improved symptoms. Regardless of past use, the majority of participants believed that psychedelics have potential for chronic pain treatments and would be willing to participate in a psychedelic-based clinical trial for their pain. These findings support the need for additional studies to understand the potential and effectiveness of psychedelic substances in managing FM symptoms."

Premature access to psychoactive drugs may represent a risk factor for drug misuse. Conversely, religious affiliation seems to play a protective role in terms of substance abuse. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of drug use in a sample of adolescents using ayahuasca within a religious setting. Forty-one adolescents from a Brazilian ayahuasca sect were compared with 43 adolescents who never drank ayahuasca. No significant differences were identified in terms of lifetime substance consumption. Throughout the previous year period, ayahuasca adolescents used less alcohol (46.31%) than the comparison group (74.4%). Recent use of alcohol was also more frequent among the latter group (65.1%) than among ayahuasca drinkers (32.5%). Although not statistically significant, slight differences in terms of patterns of drug use were definitely observed among groups. Despite their early exposure to a hallucinogenic substance, adolescents using ayahuasca in a controlled setting were mostly comparable to controls except for a considerably smaller proportion of alcohol users. Religious affiliation may have played a central role as a possible protective factor for alcohol use. Thus, ayahuasca seems to be a relatively safe substance as far as drug misuse is concerned."

""Magic mushrooms"" is the most common name given to hallucinogenic fungi containing the psychoactive alkaloids psilocybin and psilocin. In recent years, fungis' sclerotia, commonly called ""magic truffles"" have become a form of supply of psychoactive Psilocybe alkaloids since Psilocybe sclerotia are not specifically included in the laws banning the sale, the purchase and the use of such substances and mushrooms containing them. A liquid chromatography -tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method was developed for the rapid determination of psilocybin and psilocin in Psilocybe sclerotia. Following a simple step extraction with methanol, the alkaloids were separated on a reversed-phase column using a gradient of 0.1% formic acid - acetonitrile s a mobile phase at a flow rate of 0.2mL/min.. Separated analytes were detected by electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry in the positive ion mode using multiple reaction monitoring. The developed method was linear over the calibration range for all two substances under investigation, with a r2>0.99. The detection and quantification limits were 0.3μg and 1μg per 100mg truffles, for both psilocin and psilocybin and the intra- and inter-day coefficients of variation were always better than 15%. Using this method, the presence of only psilocybin was demonstrated in examined Psilocybe sclerotia. The content of psilocybin was found to vary over a concentration range of 59.3 to 167.8μg per 100mg of fresh sclerotia. © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"3096","1","Impaired cognitive performance in drug free users of recreational ecstasy (MDMA).^
OBJECTIVES: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and related congerers: MDA, MDEA) is the name given to a group of popular recreational drugs. Animal data raise concern about neurotoxic effects of high doses of ecstasy on central serotonergic systems. The threshold dose for neurotoxicity in humans is not clear and serotonin is involved in several functions including cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate cognitive performance in a group of typical recreational ecstasy users. METHODS: A comprehensive cognitive test battery was administered to 28 abstinent ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only and to two equally sized matched groups of cannabis users and non-users. The sample consisted of ecstasy users with a typical recreational use pattern and did not include very heavy users. RESULTS: Ecstasy users were unimpaired in simple tests of attention (alertness). However, they performed worse than one or both control groups in the more complex tests of attention, in memory and learning tasks, and in tasks reflecting aspects of general intelligence. Heavier ecstasy and heavier cannabis use were associated with poorer performance in the group of ecstasy users. By contrast, the cannabis users did not differ significantly in their performance from the non-users. CONCLUSIONS: The present data raise concern that use of ecstasy possibly in conjunction with cannabis may lead to cognitive decline in otherwise healthy young people. Although the nature of the emerging cognitive disturbance is not yet clear, an impairment of working memory might be the common denominator underlying or contributing to declines of performance in various tasks. The cognitive disturbance is likely to be related to the well recognised neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. The data suggest that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause neurotoxicity in humans."
"8578","1","The external validity of results derived from ecstasy users recruited using purposive sampling strategies.^
This study sought to compare the patterns and correlates of 'recent' and 'regular' ecstasy use estimated on the basis of two datasets generated in 2001 in New South Wales, Australia, from a probability and a non-probability sample. The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population. These findings may partially offset concerns that purposive samples of ecstasy users are likely to remain a primary source of ecstasy-related information. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"8409","0","Will MDMA-assisted psychotherapy become a breakthrough in treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder? A critical narrative review.^
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a common mental health condition that begins after exposure to a traumatic event. Despite recommended various therapeutic approaches, including both pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy, treatment is not as effective as expected. Over recent years the pharmaceutical industry has not been able to offer a new approach, founded on multiple mechanisms of action. That is why a part of researchers focused on psychoactive substances synthesized years ago and then banned. These days MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for the treatment of PTSD clinical trials are conducted, and due to previous results, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a breakthrough therapy designation. In this article, we present the mechanism of actions, the therapeutic rationale, applied psychotherapeutic methods, and potential dangers. If ongoing phase 3 studies are completed and clinical efficacy criteria are achieved, the FDA could approve the treatment as early as 2022."
"7269","1","Use of amphetamine by recreational users of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with reduced striatal dopamine transporter densities: A [123I]β-CIT SPECT study - Preliminary report.^
Rationale: Tablets sold as ecstasy often contain not only 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) but other compounds well known to cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, such as (meth)amphetamine. Furthermore, the use of ecstasy in the Netherlands is often combined with the use of amphetamine. However, little is known about the effects of ecstasy use or the combination of ecstasy and amphetamine use on dopamine (DA) neurones in the human brain. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the effects of ecstasy as well as the combined use of ecstasy and amphetamine on the density of nigrostriatal DA neurones. Methods: [123I]β-CIT SPECT was used to quantify striatal DA transporters. Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios of control subjects (n=15) were compared with binding ratios of ecstasy users (n=29) and individuals with a history of combined ecstasy and amphetamine use (n=9) after adjustment for age. Results: Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios were significantly lower in combined ecstasy and amphetamine users compared to sole ecstasy users (6.75 versus 8.46, respectively: -20.2%, P=0.007). Binding ratios were significantly higher in ecstasy users when compared to controls (8.46 versus 7.47, respectively: +13.2%, P=0.045). Conclusions: These initial observations suggest that the sole use of ecstasy is not related to dopaminergic neurotoxicity in humans. In contrast, the reported use of amphetamine by regular users of ecstasy seems to be associated with a reduction in nigrostriatal DA neurones."

Background: The prevalence of cannabis use in HIV-infected individuals is high and its long-term effects are unclear. Methods: The prevalence, perceived benefits and consequences, and predictors of cannabis use were studied using a cross-sectional survey in two immunodeficiency clinics in Maritime Canada. Results: Current cannabis use was identified in 38.5% (87 of 226) of participants. Almost all cannabis users (85 of 87 [97.7%]) acknowledged its use for recreational purposes, with 21.8% (19 of 87) reporting medicinal cannabis use. The majority of patients enrolled in the present study reported mild or no symptoms related to HIV (n=179). Overall, 80.5% (70 of 87) of the cannabis-using participants reported a symptom-relieving benefit, mostly for relief of stress, anorexia or pain. Participants consumed a mean (± SD) of 18.3±21.1 g of cannabis per month and spent an average of $105.15±109.87 on cannabis per month. Cannabis use was associated with rural residence, lower income level, driving under the influence of a substance, and consumption of ecstasy and tobacco. Income level, ecstasy use and tobacco use were retained as significant predictors in regression modelling. Cannabis use was not associated with adverse psychological outcomes. Discusion: Prolonged previous cannabis consumption and the substantial overlap between recreational and medicinal cannabis use highlight the challenges in obtaining a tenable definition of medicinal cannabis therapy. ©2014 Pulsus Group Inc.

Purpose: To evaluate the effects of hallucinogens, opioids and methamphetamines abuse on oral and dental health of an Iranian population. Methods: In this descriptive cross sectional survey conducted in 2017, 500 drug abusers referred to addiction rehabilitation centers in Tehran Province in Tehran were selected as the study population. A questionnaire was developed to evaluate demographic data, self-reported oral health experiences during periods of substance abuse and details of substance abuse including types of substances abused, patterns and period of substance abuse. Results: After excluding 23 addicts due to incomplete data, 500 peoples participated. Of the 500 included subjects, 390 (88 %) were male and 110 (22 %) were female. As for the qualitative variables the differences were found to be significant for route of abuse (p < 0.001), smoking (p < 0.03), pain (p < 0.001) and abnormal sounds (p < 0.001) of TMJ, sensitivity of chewing muscles (p = 0.002), smoking melanosis (p < 0.05), hypertrophic lesions (p = 0.01) and bleeding on probing (p = 0.001). Conclusion: The findings reveal the poor dental and oral health status of drug addicts in Iran, especially methamphetamine abusers. Therefore, the results call for the design and implementation of oral health improvement programs for addicts in Iran."

"4356","1","MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^
RATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs."
"8892","0","Management of Treatment-Resistant Depression: Challenges and Strategies.^
Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) is a subset of Major Depressive Disorder which does not respond to traditional and first-line therapeutic options. There are several definitions and staging models of TRD and a consensus for each has not yet been established. However, in common for each model is the inadequate response to at least 2 trials of antidepressant pharmacotherapy. In this review, a comprehensive analysis of existing literature regarding the challenges and management of TRD has been compiled. A PubMed search was performed to assemble meta-analyses, trials and reviews on the topic of TRD. First, we address the confounds in the definitions and staging models of TRD, and subsequently the difficulties inherent in assessing the illness. Pharmacological augmentation strategies including lithium, triiodothyronine and second-generation antipsychotics are reviewed, as is switching of antidepressant class. Somatic therapies, including several modalities of brain stimulation (electroconvulsive therapy, repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation, magnetic seizure therapy and deep brain stimulation) are detailed, psychotherapeutic strategies and subsequently novel therapeutics including ketamine, psilocybin, anti-inflammatories and new directions are reviewed in this manuscript. Our review of the evidence suggests that further large-scale work is necessary to understand the appropriate treatment pathways for TRD and to prescribe effective therapeutic options for patients suffering from TRD."
"5703","1","Ketamine modulates fronto-striatal circuitry in depressed and healthy individuals.^
Ketamine improves motivation-related symptoms in depression but simultaneously elicits similar symptoms in healthy individuals, suggesting that it might have different effects in health and disease. This study examined whether ketamine affects the brain's fronto-striatal system, which is known to drive motivational behavior. The study also assessed whether inflammatory mechanisms-which are known to influence neural and behavioral motivational processes-might underlie some of these changes. These questions were explored in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ketamine in 33 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and 25 healthy volunteers (HVs). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) was acquired 2 days post-ketamine (final sample: TRD n = 27, HV n = 19) and post-placebo (final sample: TRD n = 25, HV n = 18) infusions and was used to probe fronto-striatal circuitry with striatal seed-based functional connectivity. Ketamine increased fronto-striatal functional connectivity in TRD participants toward levels observed in HVs while shifting the connectivity profile in HVs toward a state similar to TRD participants under placebo. Preliminary findings suggest that these effects were largely observed in the absence of inflammatory (C-reactive protein) changes and were associated with both acute and sustained improvements in symptoms in the TRD group. Ketamine thus normalized fronto-striatal connectivity in TRD participants but disrupted it in HVs independently of inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential importance of reward circuitry in ketamine's mechanism of action, which may be particularly relevant for understanding ketamine-induced shifts in motivational symptoms."
"1675","0","Posttraumatic stress disorder among substance users from the general population.^
Objective: The purpose of the study was to evaluate the prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among substance users in the general population. Method: The St. Louis Epidemiologic Catchment Area study, a survey of psychiatric illness in the general population, collected data on PTSD and substance use with the Diagnostic Interview Schedule. Among the 2,663 respondents, 430 reported a traumatic event that could qualify for PTSD; however, the rate of PTSD was low, 1.35% overall. To evaluate the relationship between PTSD and substance use, respondents were hierarchically classified into one of four substance use categories ranging from polydrug use to alcohol use only. Substance users from each category as well as substance users in general were compared with persons who did not meet the substance use threshold (comparison subjects). Results: Findings indicate that cocaine/opiate users are over three times as likely as comparison subjects to report a traumatic event, report more symptoms and events, and are more likely to meet diagnostic criteria for PTSD. Physical attack, but not combat-related events, was the most prevalent event reported among cocaine/opiate users. Onset of substance use preceded onset of posttraumatic symptoms, suggesting that substance use predisposes the individual to exposure to traumatic events. When other variables-including antisocial behavior-were controlled, female gender and use of cocaine/opiates predicted PTSD. Conclusions: These analyses of the co-occurrence of substance abuse and PTSD warrant further study and suggest that PTSD is much more common among substance abusers than was previously known."
"5023","1","Early symptomatic improvements as a predictor of response to repeated-dose intravenous ketamine: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^
BACKGROUND: Early symptomatic improvement with monoamine-based antidepressants is predictive of treatment response. The objective of this study was to determine if early symptomatic improvements with intravenous (IV) ketamine predicted treatment response to an acute course of four infusions. METHOD: 134 adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) received four ketamine infusions over one to two weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Quick Inventory for Depressive Symptomatology Self-Report(16) (QIDS-SR(16)) at baseline and post-infusions 1, 2, 3, and 4. Early improvement was defined as ≥20% reduction in QIDS-SR(16) scores after the first or second infusion. Linear models were used to determine whether early improvement was associated with post-infusion 4 QIDS-SR(16) scores after controlling for baseline characteristics. RESULTS: Early improvement post-infusion 1 (β = -3.52, 95% BCa CI [-5.40, -1.78]) and 2 (β = -3.16, 95% BCa CI [-5.75, -1.59]) both significantly predicted QIDS-SR(16) scores post-infusion 4. Early improvers had significantly lower QIDS-SR(16) scores at post-infusion 4 (post-infusion 1 improvers: M = 9.8, SD = 4.5; post-infusion 2 improvers: M = 10.6, SD = 5.7) compared to non-early improvers (post-infusion 1 non-improvers: M = 13.7, SD = 5.8; post-infusion 2 non-improvers: M = 14.1, SD = 5.3) when controlling for baseline characteristics. The majority (58%) of individuals who did not improve post-infusions 1 or 2 still experienced an antidepressant response or partial response (≥20% reduction in QIDS-SR(16)) post-infusion 4. LIMITATIONS: This is a post-hoc analysis of an open-label study. CONCLUSION: Early improvement was associated with greater antidepressant effects following a course of four ketamine infusions. However, individuals who did not show early improvements still had a high likelihood of experiencing clinically significant symptom reduction after the fourth infusion, suggesting that completing four infusions, regardless of early symptom changes, is appropriate and merited."

This randomized‐controlled pilot study uses a wait‐list control design. A wait‐list design includes a control group that is assigned to a waiting list to receive an intervention after the active treatment group does. In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait‐list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34. The wait‐list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait‐list participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date. This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and follow‐up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a total of 12 completer participants as well as 2‐3 family members or friends per study participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM‐R). This number will account for screen‐failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6‐month delayed participation group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects of the psilocybin intervention. Twelve volunteers (6 from each group) will participate at Johns Hopkins and 12 at New York University. Randomization and data analysis will be conducted at New York University."
"3089","0","Ketamine mechanism of action: Separating the wheat from the chaff.^
This article discusses the mechanism of action of ketamine. Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant effects in severely ill-depressed patients who have failed conventional treatments. This clinical finding has been paradigm-shifting as there is now tremendous hope that very ill-depressed patients can be treated in a matter of hours, rather than many weeks or months required for standard therapies to take effect. However, although the therapeutic potential of ketamine has elicited tremendous excitement in the field, ketamine’s use outside of a monitored clinic setting is limited due to its anesthetic actions at higher doses, abuse liability, ataxic effects, and capacity to produce changes in sensation and dissociation even when administered at sub-anesthetic antidepressant- effective doses. Ketamine’s antidepressant action had been presumed to be via its anesthetic target, which is the inhibition of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized in the liver via multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms to norketamine, dehydronorketamine, hydroxyketamines, and a number of hydroxynorketamines (HNKs) in a stereoselective manner. Validation of the relevance of HNK metabolites to the clinical antidepressant actions of ketamine in humans will require human clinical trials, which are currently in preparation.

Comments on an article by Margaret C. Wardle et al. (see record [rid]2014-34036-005[/rid]). In their impressively large study, participants visited the laboratory on three occasions and received a different pharmacological treatment each time. On one visit, participants received placebo, but the other two times they received either 0.75 or 1.5mg/kg of MDMA. They were then asked to rate the valence of positive, neutral and negative images from the International Affective Picture System database. Critically, half of the images at each valence level contained social content, whereas the remaining images contained non-social content. Wardle et al. found that MDMA increased how positively participants rated positive social images but decreased how positively they rated positive non-social images. There were no effects of MDMA on the ratings of negative or neutral images whether they were social or non-social. This pattern of results was interpreted as demonstrating a 'socially selective' effect of MDMA on how people process rewards. With these results in hand, it can be seen how this enhancement of the positivity of social rewards could lead an MDMA user to readily approach people at raves and parties. Second, closer examination of the stimuli used by Wardle et al. may point to an even greater selectivity of MDMA's effects on social approach. The social images used by Wardle et al. in this study featured more than one person. Yet, in a separate study with a subset of these subjects, MDMA failed to increase how friendly, attractive or trustworthy participants rated images of individual faces.

"1994","0","Prevention of Emergence Agitation with Ketamine in Rhinoplasty.^
BACKGROUND: Emergence agitation (EA), defined as restlessness, disorientation, excitation, and/or inconsolable crying, is a common phenomenon during early recovery from general anesthesia. In this study, we aimed to determine the (1) EA incidence after rhinoplasty operations in adults; (2) the effects of ketamine administered at sub-anesthetic doses just 20 min before the end of the surgery in rhinoplasty operations on agitation level, postoperative pain, side effects, and complications; and (3) to determine the risk factors for EA in adults after rhinoplasty. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Totally 140 patients scheduled to undergo elective rhinoplasty were enrolled in this prospective study. Patients were equally and randomly divided into two groups: saline group (control group) (n = 70) and ketamine group (n = 70). Twenty minutes before surgery completion, 1 ml saline was administered via the intravenous (i.v.) route to the saline group, while 0.5 mg/kg ketamine was administered via i.v. patients in the ketamine group. The emergence agitation level of the patients was evaluated using the Richmond Agitation-Sedation Scale just after extubation and in the post-anesthesia care unit (PACU). For postoperative pain evaluation, the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) was scored (from 0 to 10) every 10 min until the patients were discharged from PACU. RESULTS: EA incidence in the control group was as high as 54.3%, while in the ketamine group it was 8.6% just after extubation (p < 0.001). In the PACU, EA incidence was 28.6% in the control group, while none of the patients had EA in the PACU in the ketamine group (p < 0.001). Male gender, severe pain (NRS ≥ 5), and smoking were defined as significant risk factors for EA both after extubation and during follow-ups in the PACU (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Emergence agitation after rhinoplasty is a common complication, likely disturbing operative outcomes in adults. Ketamine at sub-anesthetic doses is highly effective in preventing EA. Further, larger-scale prospective studies are warranted to determine preventive measures for EA development in rhinoplasty.

The effects of expectancies on subjective responses to oral delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC) were examined. Thirty-five regular marijuana users were assigned to one of two groups: one group was told that they may receive a cannabinoid or placebo and a second group was told that they may receive a drug from one of several classes of drugs (e.g., stimulant, sedative, antiemetic) or placebo. Regardless of the group to which they were assigned, subjects received each of two oral doses of delta9-THC (7.5 and 15 mg) and placebo, one dose per session, for a total of three sessions. Measures of subjective effects, including visual analog scales and the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), were administered at 0.5-h intervals throughout each session. Consistent with previous research using other drugs, subjects in the current experiment who expected to receive a cannabinoid reported greater pleasurable effects than subjects who did not have this expectancy. The results have implications for understanding the effects of cannabinoids when used in both recreational and clinical settings."
"8434","1","Persistent nigrostriatal dopaminergic abnormalities in ex-users of MDMA (ecstasy): An 18F-dopa PET Study.^
Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a popular recreational drug with known serotonergic neurotoxicity. Its long-term effects on dopaminergic function are less certain. Studying the long-term effects of ecstasy is often confounded by concomitant polydrug use and the short duration of abstinence. We used 18F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the long-term effects of ecstasy on nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in a group of male ex-recreational users of ecstasy who had been abstinent for a mean of 3.22 years. We studied 14 ex-ecstasy users (EEs), 14 polydrug-using controls (PCs) (matched to the ex-users for other recreational drug use), and 12 drug-naive controls (DCs). Each participant underwent one 18F-dopa PET, cognitive assessments, and hair and urinary analyses to corroborate drug-use history. The putamen 18F-dopa uptake of EEs was 9% higher than that of DCs (p=0.021). The putamen uptake rate of PCs fell between the other two groups, suggesting that the hyperdopaminergic state in EEs may be due to the combined effects of ecstasy and polydrug use. There was no relationship between the amount of ecstasy used and striatal 18 F-dopa uptake. Increased putaminal 18 F-dopa uptake in EEs after an abstinence of 3 years (mean) suggests that the effects are long lasting. Our findings suggest potential long-term effects of ecstasy use, in conjunction with other recreational drugs, on nigrostriatal dopaminergic functions. Further longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the significance of these findings as they may have important public health implications. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"5315","1","Psilocybin microdosing does not affect emotion-related symptoms and processing: A preregistered field and lab-based study.^
BACKGROUND: Microdoses of psychedelics (i.e. a sub-hallucinogenic dose taken every third day) can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress according to anecdotal reports and observational studies. Research with medium to high doses of psilocybin points towards potential underlying mechanisms, including the modulation of emotion and interoceptive processing. AIMS: In this preregistered study, we investigated whether psilocybin microdoses alter self-reported interoceptive awareness and whether repeated microdosing over 3 weeks modulates emotion processing and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire 1½ h after self-administering their second dose (or placebo), and the emotional go/no-go task and the shortened Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 1½ h after self-administering their seventh dose. RESULTS: Our confirmatory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect emotion processing or symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with placebo. Our exploratory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect self-reported interoceptive awareness, that symptoms of depression and stress were significantly reduced in the first block compared with baseline, that participants broke blind in the second block and that there was no effect of expectations. Further research in a substance-naïve population with clinical range anxiety and depressive symptoms is needed to substantiate the potential beneficial effects of microdosing."
"950","0","Novel drug developmental strategies for treatment-resistant depression.^
Major depressive disorder is a leading cause of disability worldwide. Because conventional therapies are ineffective in many patients, novel strategies are needed to overcome treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Limiting factors of successful drug development in the last decades were the lack of (1) knowledge of pathophysiology, (2) translational animal models and (3) objective diagnostic biomarkers. Here, we review novel drug targets and drug candidates currently investigated in Phase I-III clinical trials. The most promising approaches are inhibition of glutamatergic neurotransmission by NMDA and mGlu(5) receptor antagonists, modulation of the opioidergic system by κ receptor antagonists, and hallucinogenic tryptamine derivates. The only registered drug for TRD is the NMDA receptor antagonist, S-ketamine, but add-on therapies with second-generation antipsychotics, certain nutritive, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotective agents seem to be effective. Currently, there is an intense research focus on large-scale, high-throughput omics and neuroimaging studies. These results might provide new insights into molecular mechanisms and potential novel therapeutic strategies."

This reprinted article originally appeared in Journal of Neuropsychiatry & Clinical Neurosciences, Spring 2002, Vol 14(2), pp. 125-129. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2002-01715-001[/rid].) Is there anatomical injury from methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)--also known as ecstasy--use? A major challenge is designing studies that can clearly answer this question. Inherent difficulties include unknown premorbid serotonin functioning; the effect of concomitant drug use (most users are polydrug users); reliability of self-reported usage; wide ranges in lifetime dose; variability in time from last dose; small group size; and difficulty in recruiting a comparable control group. With these significant limitations in mind, a brief review and synthesis of existing neuroimaging studies may aid the neuropsychiatrist in understanding the postulated effects of MDMA on the serotonin system, the potential secondary and tertiary effects mediated by vascular and other mechanisms, and possible implications for future health care demands. These reports on the effects of ecstasy demonstrate the progress being made in the study of brain functioning from an anatomical and neurochemical perspective.

"3898","0","'Repeated but not single administration of ketamine prolongs increases of the firing activity of norepinephrine and dopamine neurons': Corrigendum.^
Reports an error in 'Repeated but not single administration of ketamine prolongs increases of the firing activity of norepinephrine and dopamine neurons' by Chidiebere M. Iro, Rami Hamati, Mostafa El Mansari and Pierre Blier (International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology, 2021[Jul], Vol 24[7], 570-579). In the original article, in tables 2 and 3, some of the numbers of rats and neurons appeared in the wrong rows. This has now been corrected online. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2021-72250-006[/rid]). Background: Clinical studies have shown that the rapid antidepressant effect of the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine generally disappears within 1 week but can be maintained by repeated administration. Preclinical studies showed that a single ketamine injection immediately increases the firing and burst activity of norepinephrine (NE) neurons, but not that of serotonin (5-HT) neurons. It also enhances the population activity of dopamine (DA) neurons. In the present study, we investigated whether such alterations of monoamine neuronal firing are still present 1 day after a single injection, and whether they can be maintained by repeated injections. Methods: Rats received a single ketamine injection or 6 over 2 weeks and the firing activity of dorsal raphe nucleus 5-HT, locus coeruleus NE, and ventral tegmental area DA neurons was assessed. Results: One day following a single injection of ketamine, there was no change in the firing activity of 5-HT, NE, or DA neurons. One day after repeated ketamine administration, however, there was a robust increase of the firing activity of NE neurons and an enhancement of burst and population activities of DA neurons, but still no change in firing parameters of 5-HT neurons. The increased activity of NE neurons was no longer present 3 days after the last injection, whereas that of DA neurons was still present. DA neurons were firing normally 7 days after repeated injections. Conclusion: These results imply that the enhanced activity of NE and DA neurons may play a significant role in the maintenance of the antidepressant action of ketamine.

"8226","0","Association between a cannabinoid receptor gene (CNR1) polymorphism and cannabinoid-induced alterations of the auditory event-related P300 potential.^
Numerous studies demonstrated a close relationship between cannabis abuse and schizophrenia with similar impairments in cognitive processing, particularly in P300 generation. Recently, an (AAT)n triplet repeat polymorphism within the cannabinoid receptor gene CNR1 has been found to be associated with both schizophrenia and substance dependence, and to modulate the P300 potential. As previously reported, both acute oral Δ(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ(9)-THC), the main psychoactive constituent of cannabis, and standardized cannabis extract containing Δ(9)-THC and cannabidiol (CBD) revealed a significant reduction of P300 amplitudes in healthy subjects but did not show any differences among each other. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the (AAT)n polymorphism differentially modulates the effects of Δ(9)-THC and cannabis extract on P300 generation in 20 healthy volunteers during an auditory choice reaction task. For the >10/>10 genotype, there was a significant decrease of P300 amplitude as well as a significant prolongation of P300 latency under pure Δ(9)-THC but not under cannabis extract. Moreover, we found a significant correlation between the number of AAT repeats and P300 variables for the Δ(9)-THC condition. Our data thus indicate that the CNR1 gene seems to be involved in the regulation of the P300 wave as a marker of selective attention and working memory. Moreover, it appears that variations within CNR1 may differentially alter the sensitivity to the acute effects of cannabinoids on P300 generation in healthy subjects."

"9244","1","Ketamine-induced changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the resting-state functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex.^
OBJECTIVES: Synaptic plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling are proposed to play key roles in antidepressant drug action. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). METHODS: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. RESULTS: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate BDNF level dynamics following ketamine are related to acute and 24 h RSFC changes. Particularly when BDNF increases are observed after ketamine infusion, a disconnection from dmPFC after 24 h is seen and may reflect synaptic plasticity effects."
"863","1","Multiple drug ingestion by ecstasy abusers in the United States.^
The abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9). In addition to MDMA/MDA, the most commonly identified drug groups (%) were cannabis (THCCOOH) (61.6%); amphetamine/ methamphetamine (38.4%); benzoylecgonine (30.8%); diazepam-related (9.6%); opiates (7.1%); alprazolam (5.6%); and others (5.6%). Although multidrug ingestion appears to be common amongst ecstasy users, caution is recommended in interpretation. Illicit ecstasy in the United States and Canada frequently contains methamphetamine and other active substances, and multidrug use may not have been intentional."
"434","0","MDMA treatment paired with a trauma-cue promotes adaptive stress responses in a translational model of PTSD in rats.^
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine), a synthetic ring-substituted amphetamine, combined with psychotherapy has demonstrated efficacy for the treatment of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) patients. This controlled prospective study aimed to assess the bio-behavioral underpinnings of MDMA in a translational model of PTSD. Rats exposed to predator-scent stress (PSS) were subjected to a trauma-cue at day 7 shortly after single-dose MDMA injection (5 mg/kg). The elevated plus maze and acoustic startle response tests were assessed on day 14 and served for classification into behavioral response groups. Freezing response to a further trauma-reminder was assessed on Day 15. The morphological characteristics of the dentate gyrus (DG) and basolateral amygdala (BLA) were subsequently examined. Hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis and 5-hydroxytryptamine involvement were evaluated using: (1) corticosterone measurements at 2 h and 4 h after MDMA treatment, (2) Lewis strain rats with blunted HPA-response and (3) pharmacological receptor-blockade. MDMA treatment was effective in attenuating stress behavioral responses only when paired with memory reactivation by a trauma-cue. The effects of the treatment on behavior were associated with a commensurate normalization of the dendritic cytoarchitecture of DG and BLA neurons. Pretreatment with RU486, Ketanserin, or Pindolol prevented the above improvement in anxiety-like behavioral responses. MDMA treatment paired with memory reactivation reduced the prevalence rate of PTSD-phenotype 14 days later and normalized the cytoarchitecture changes induced by PSS (in dendritic complexities) compared to saline control. MDMA treatment paired with a trauma-cue may modify or update the original traumatic memory trace through reconsolidation processes. These anxiolytic-like effects seem to involve the HPA axis and 5-HT systems."
"1456","1","Effect of Low Dose of Ketamine on Learning Memory Function in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy-A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Clinical Study.^
OBJECTIVES: Converging evidence suggests that low doses of ketamine have antidepressant effects. The feasibility and safety of administering low doses of ketamine as adjunctive medication during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to enhance ECT efficacy and mitigate cognitive impairment has attracted much attention. This study investigated the effects of low doses of ketamine on learning and memory in patients undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study recruited patients with moderate to severe depressive disorders who failed to respond to antidepressants and were scheduled to receive ECT. Participants were randomly assigned to a study group, which received an intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia, and a control group, which received isovolumetric placebo (normal saline) and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of depression after ECT. Before and after the ECT course, the Mini-mental State Examination and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision were used to assess global cognitive and learning and memory functions, respectively. Psychotropic effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Vital signs and other adverse events were recorded for each ECT procedure. RESULTS: Of 132 patients recruited, 66 were assigned to each group; 63 patients in study groups and 64 patients in the control group completed the ECT course during the study. Afterward, the incidence of global cognitive impairment in the control group was higher than it was in the study group. In addition, the decline in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision scale was greater in the control group than in the study group. The necessary ECT treatment times were shorter in the study group than in the control group (8 [7, 9] vs 9 [8, 10]). No significant escalations of the positive Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores or adverse events were observed in the study group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunctive medication, ketamine can attenuate learning and memory impairment, especially for short-term memory, caused by ECT performed under propofol anesthesia. Ketamine can also reduce ECT treatment times during the therapy course without inducing significant adverse effects."
"1766","0","Effects of haloperidol on the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, motor, and neuroendocrine effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in humans.^
INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoids produce a spectrum of effects in humans including euphoria, cognitive impairments, psychotomimetic effects, and perceptual alterations. The extent to which dopaminergic systems contribute to the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) remains unclear. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist altered the effects of Delta-9-THC in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 2-test-day double-blind study, 28 subjects including healthy subjects (n = 17) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 11) were administered active (0.057 mg/kg) or placebo oral haloperidol in random order followed 90 and 215 min later by fixed order intravenous administration of placebo (vehicle) and active (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta-9-THC, respectively. RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports, intravenous Delta-9-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects including ""high."" Delta-9-THC also impaired verbal recall and attention. Haloperidol pretreatment did not reduce any of the behavioral effects of Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol worsened the immediate free and delayed free and cued recall deficits produced by Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol and Delta-9-THC worsened distractibility and vigilance. Neither drug impaired performance on a motor screening task, the Stockings of Cambridge task, or the delayed match to sample task. Frequent users had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels and blunted Delta-9-THC induced memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious effects of haloperidol pretreatment on the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC are consistent with the preclinical literature in suggesting crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems. However, it is unlikely that DA D(2) receptor mechanisms play a major role in mediating the psychotomimetic and perceptual altering effects of Delta-9-THC. Further investigation is warranted to understand the basis of the psychotomimetic effects of Delta-9-THC and to better understand the crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems."
"2966","0","The psychedelic model of schizophrenia: the case of N,N dimethyltryptamine.^
The authors review the research on N,N dimethyltryptamine (DMT) as a possible 'schizotoxin'. DMT produces psychedelic effects when administered to normal subjects, the means are present to synthesize it in man, it has occasionally been found in man, and tolerance to its behavioral effects is incomplete. However, DMT concentrations have not been proven to differ significantly in schizophrenics and normal controls. Also, in vivo synthesis of DMT has not been convincingly demonstrated, and the psychological changes it produces do not closely mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia. The authors conclude that more data are necessary before the validity of this theory can be determined."
"6549","1","Does chronic use of amphetamine-type stimulants impair interference control? - A meta-analysis.^
In substance use and addiction, inhibitory control is key to ignoring triggers, withstanding craving and maintaining abstinence. In amphetamine-type stimulant (ATS) users, most research focused on behavioral inhibition, but largely neglected the equally important subdomain of cognitive interference control. Given its crucial role in managing consumption, we investigated the relationship between interference control and chronic ATS use in adults. A database search (Pubmed & Web of Science) and relevant reviews were used to identify eligible studies. Effect sizes were estimated with random effects models. Subgroup, meta-regression, and sensitivity analyses explored heterogeneity in effect sizes. We identified 61 studies (53 datasets) assessing interference control in 1873 ATS users and 1905 controls. Findings revealed robust small effect sizes for ATS-related deficits in interference control, which were mainly seen in methamphetamine, as compared to MDMA users. The differential effects are likely due to tolerance-induced dopaminergic deficiencies (presumably most pronounced in methamphetamine users). Similarities between different ATS could be due to noradrenergic deficiencies; but elucidating their functional role in ATS users requires further/more research."
"3602","1","Self-control, peers, and adolescent substance use: an international analysis.^
Background: Adolescent substance use continues to be a global concern. Research has shown that two consistent predictors of this behavior are self-control and peer substance use. The objective of this study was to determine if these two variables interact to affect the frequency of substance use among young people. Methods: The analysis utilized three years of data from the Second International Self-Report Delinquency study (2005-2007) (ISRD-2), which gathered information from youth, ages 12-17, residing in 30 nations (n = 72,206). Illicit substance use included cannabis, ecstasy, stimulants, and other substances. A zero-inflated negative binomial model that adjusts for selection effects was estimated to predict the frequency of substance use. Results: The results showed that adolescents with low self-control who associated with substance using peers tended to be the most frequent substance users. Yet, youth with higher levels of selfcontrol were likely to report no or low frequency use regardless of the number of their friends who used illicit substances. Conclusions: Self-control affects substance use among adolescents and can attenuate the influence of peer substance use. Research using longitudinal data is needed to disentangle changes in self-control, peer substance use, and one’s own substance use."
"8041","1","Comparative Effectiveness of Intravenous Ketamine and Intranasal Esketamine in Clinical Practice Among Patients With Treatment-Refractory Depression: An Observational Study.^
Objective: Ketamine has been redeveloped as a rapid-acting antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is a paucity of literature comparing subanesthetic intravenous (IV) ketamine and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved intranasal (IN) esketamine for TRD in real-world clinical settings. We compared the efficacy and time to achieve remission/response with repeated ketamine and esketamine. Methods: An observational study of adults with TRD received up to 6 IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or up to 8 IN esketamine (56- or 84-mg) treatments from August 17, 2017, to June 24, 2021. Depressive symptoms were measured utilizing the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (QIDS-SR) before and 24 hours after treatment. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between time to response ( ≥ 50% change in QIDS-SR score) and remission (QIDS-SR score ≤ 5). Results: Sixty-two adults (median age = 50 years, 65% female) received IV ketamine (76%, n = 47) or IN esketamine (24%, n = 15). Neither baseline-to-endpoint change in QIDS-SR score nor response/remission rates were significantly different between groups. Time to remission, defined as number of treatments (adjusting for age, body mass index [BMI], sex, and baseline QIDS-SR score), was faster for IV versus IN treatment (HR = 5.0, P = .02). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine showed similar rates of response and remission in TRD patients, but the number of treatments required to achieve remission was significantly lower with IV ketamine compared to IN esketamine. These findings need to be investigated in a randomized control trial comparing these two treatment interventions."

AIMS: To examine the prevalence rates and correlates of non-medical use of prescription stimulants (Ritalin, Dexedrine or Adderall) among US college students in terms of student and college characteristics. DESIGN: A self-administered mail survey. SETTING: One hundred and nineteen nationally representative 4-year colleges in the United States. PARTICIPANTS: A representative sample of 10 904 randomly selected college students in 2001. MEASUREMENTS: Self-reports of non-medical use of prescription stimulants and other substance use behaviors. FINDINGS: The life-time prevalence of non-medical prescription stimulant use was 6.9%, past year prevalence was 4.1% and past month prevalence was 2.1%. Past year rates of non-medical use ranged from zero to 25% at individual colleges. Multivariate regression analyses indicated non-medical use was higher among college students who were male, white, members of fraternities and sororities and earned lower grade point averages. Rates were higher at colleges located in the north-eastern region of the US and colleges with more competitive admission standards. Non-medical prescription stimulant users were more likely to report use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and other risky behaviors. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study provide evidence that non-medical use of prescription stimulants is more prevalent among particular subgroups of US college students and types of colleges. The non-medical use of prescription stimulants represents a high-risk behavior that should be monitored further and intervention efforts are needed to curb this form of drug use."
"3304","1","Predicting responses to psychedelics: A prospective study.^
Responses to psychedelics are notoriously difficult to predict, yet significant work is currently underway to assess their therapeutic potential and the level of interest in psychedelics among the general public appears to be increasing. We aimed to collect prospective data in order to improve our ability to predict acute- and longer-term responses to psychedelics. Individuals who planned to take a psychedelic through their own initiative participated in an online survey (www.psychedelicsurvey.com). Traits and variables relating to set, setting and the acute psychedelic experience were measured at five different time points before and after the experience. Principle component and regression methods were used to analyse the data. Sample sizes for the five time points were N = 654, N = 535, N = 379, N = 315, and N = 212 respectively. Psychological well-being was increased 2 weeks after a psychedelic experience and remained at this level after 4 weeks. Higher ratings of a ""mystical-type experience"" had a positive effect on the change in well-being after a psychedelic experience, whereas the other acute psychedelic experience measures, i.e., ""challenging experience"" and ""visual effects"", did not influence the change in well-being after the psychedelic experience. Having ""clear intentions"" for the experience was conducive to mystical-type experiences. Having a positive ""set"" as well as having the experience with intentions related to ""recreation"" were both found to decrease the likelihood of having a challenging experience. The baseline trait ""absorption"" and higher drug doses promoted all aspects of the acute experience, i.e., mystical-type and challenging experiences, as well as visual effects. When comparing the relative contribution of different types of variables in explaining the variance in the change in well-being, it seemed that baseline trait variables had the strongest effect on the change in well-being after a psychedelic experience. These results confirm the importance of extra-pharmacological factors in determining responses to a psychedelic. We view this study as an early step towards the development of empirical guidelines that can evolve and improve iteratively with the ultimate purpose of guiding crucial clinical decisions about whether, when, where and how to dose with a psychedelic, thus helping to mitigate risks while maximizing potential benefits in an evidence-based manner."

Recently, there has been interest in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin for depression, anxiety and fear of death in terminal illness. The aim of this review is to discuss the potential use of LSD and psilocybin for patients with persistent pain. LSD and psilocybin are 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor agonists and may interact with nociceptive and antinociceptive processing. Tentative evidence from a systematic review suggests that LSD (7 studies, 323 participants) and psilocybin (3 studies, 92 participants) may be beneficial for depression and anxiety associated with distress in life-threatening diseases. LSD and psilocybin are generally safe if administered by a healthcare professional, although further investigations are needed to assess their utility for patients with persistent pain, especially associated with terminal illness."

We review evidence that structural brain abnormalities are associated with abuse of amphetamines. A brief history of amphetamine use/abuse and evidence for toxicity is followed by a summary of findings from structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies of human subjects who had abused amphetamines and children who were exposed to amphetamines in utero. Evidence comes from studies that used a variety of techniques including manual tracing, pattern matching, voxel-based, tensor-based, or cortical thickness mapping, quantification of white matter signal hyperintensities, and diffusion tensor imaging. Ten studies compared controls to individuals who were exposed to methamphetamine. Three studies assessed individuals exposed to 3-4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Brain structural abnormalities were consistently reported in amphetamine abusers, as compared to control subjects. These included lower cortical gray matter volume and higher striatal volume than control subjects. These differences might reflect brain features that could predispose to substance dependence. High striatal volumes might also reflect compensation for toxicity in the dopamine-rich basal ganglia. Prenatal exposure was associated with striatal volume that was below control values, suggesting that such compensation might not occur in utero. Several forms of white matter abnormality are also common and may involve gliosis. Many of the limitations and inconsistencies in the literature relate to techniques and cross-sectional designs, which cannot infer causality. Potential confounding influences include effects of pre existing risk/protective factors, development, gender, severity of amphetamine abuse, abuse of other drugs, abstinence, and differences in lifestyle. Longitudinal designs in which multimodal datasets are acquired and are subjected to multivariate analyses would enhance our ability to provide general conclusions regarding the associations between amphetamine abuse and brain structure. © 2008 New York Academy of Sciences."
"8853","1","Confidence and psychosis: a neuro-computational account of contingency learning disruption by NMDA blockade.^
A state of pathological uncertainty about environmental regularities might represent a key step in the pathway to psychotic illness. Early psychosis can be investigated in healthy volunteers under ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Here, we explored the effects of ketamine on contingency learning using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed an instrumental learning task, in which cue-outcome contingencies were probabilistic and reversed between blocks. Bayesian model comparison indicated that in such an unstable environment, reinforcement learning parameters are downregulated depending on confidence level, an adaptive mechanism that was specifically disrupted by ketamine administration. Drug effects were underpinned by altered neural activity in a fronto-parietal network, which reflected the confidence-based shift to exploitation of learned contingencies. Our findings suggest that an early characteristic of psychosis lies in a persistent doubt that undermines the stabilization of behavioral policy resulting in a failure to exploit regularities in the environment."
"3469","0","Personality characteristics associated with psychedelic flashbacks in natural and experimental settings.^
This study compared Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) profiles of psychedelic drug users with and without previous flashback experiences. MMPI differences enabled correct classification of the majority of both types of subject. Controlling for differences which might be attributable to the flashbacks themselves, profiles associated with previous flashbacks still reflected more 'loose', less reality oriented thinking. Under experimental conditions involving mild sensory deprivation, subjects with MMPI evidence of loose thinking experienced significantly more psychedelic like sensations, even when given instructions that tended to inhibit altered states of consciousness. The results are interpreted as suggesting that flashbacks are exacerbations of more stable psychopathology which occur in situations that tend to induce altered states of consciousness even without previous drug use."
"2629","1","Test-retest reliability and cross-cultural applicability of DSM-5 adopted diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorders.^
Background: Despite increasing prevalence of nonmedical ketamine use globally, data on ketamine use disorders, which are classified in the DSM-5 under criteria for phencyclidine, are limited. This study assessed the reliability and applicability of DSM-based diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorder. Methods: Participants who used ecstasy were recruited through the Tri-City Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse, and Dependence in St. Louis, Miami, and Sydney. Those who reported using ketamine (lifetime use >5 times) were included in these analyses (n = 205). Participants were interviewed using the computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drugs (CD-SAM) at baseline and 7 days later for the reliability of diagnoses and individual diagnostic criteria. Results: Overall, 29.3% met DSM-5 adopted criteria for ketamine use disorder at Time 1. Moderate to excellent test-retest reliability was observed consistently across study sites for any ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.57, Y = 0.61) and severe ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.62, Y = 0.79). Continued use of ketamine despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems was the most frequently endorsed individual criterion (59.0%), followed by reported withdrawal (30.2%) and physically hazardous use (29.8%). All individual criteria had acceptable reliability estimates (κ ≥ 0.41). Conclusions: Diagnoses of ketamine use disorder can be reliably evaluated using this fully structured diagnostic instrument's questions and algorithm. Ketamine-related withdrawal among people who use ketamine should be re-evaluated. Considering that after-effects of this dissociative anesthetic can last for many hours, it is important to explore a different timeframe for possible withdrawal effects."
"1814","1","The NEO-FFI domain of openness to experience moderates ketamine response in treatment resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: There are many putative mechanisms by which ketamine has its effect and many unanswered questions about risks and benefits of long-term ketamine therapy. A research imperative is the identification of predictors of response to intravenous ketamine, especially a sustained response to maintenance ketamine. Temperament is an inherited aspect of personality and is a predictive factor for outcome in treatment resistant depressed (TRD) patients. METHODS: We analyzed which domains of personality impacted initial and sustained ketamine response. Utilizing the Neuroticism Extraversion Openness Five Factor Inventory (NEO-FFI) on 125 participants with TRD, we tested (1) whether the degree of neuroticism predicted initial and/or sustained response to ketamine; and (2) whether extraversion, agreeableness, openness to experience, and conscientiousness had an impact on response. RESULTS: Our findings confirmed previous literature that elevated neuroticism, low conscientiousness, and low extraversion was the pattern of our TRD population regardless of response. Openness was the only factor to significantly predict sustained treatment outcome. LIMITATIONS: Our findings are limited by the lack of placebo control, small sample size, non- standardized infusion intervals, polypharmacy rather than ketamine monotherapy, a select TRD population in that they had all failed ECT, and a primarily Caucasian population. CONCLUSIONS: Our registry adds to the literature that factors making up temperament may have predictive value in regard to treatment response, specifically the outcome for TRD patients receiving long-term ketamine infusion therapy. If confirmed, assessing for Openness could reduce inappropriate exposure to ketamine with its attendant unknown long-term risks."
"4241","1","10.4 COMPARISON OF IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT MEASURES OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AFTER KETAMINE TREATMENT IN ADOLESCENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER.^
Objectives: MDD is a significant pediatric health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. Prior studies have shown that ketamine is an effective treatment for adults with MDD, but little research has been conducted with pediatric MDD populations. In adults, implicit association tests (IATs) have demonstrated sensitivity to mental health changes as correlated with explicit measures on psychiatric scales. Comparing explicit and implicit measures following ketamine treatment in adolescents may illuminate the breadth of treatment response. Methods: A double blind, midazolam‐controlled, crossover study was performed (n = 17) in which subjects received 1 infusion of either ketamine or midazolam, given in random order, spaced 2 weeks apart. Participants completed the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Children’s Depression Rating Scale‐Revised (CDRS‐R), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children Second Edition (MASC 2) at 1 day following treatment. A subset of participants (n = 12) took IATs at baseline and 1‐day postinfusion. Four measurements were evaluated using IATs: 1) depression; 2) suicide/death; 3) self‐harm; and 4) anxiety. D scores from the 1‐day postinfusion IATs for all 4 IAT measurements were compared with explicit rating scales and subscales. Results: Significant changes were found from both the implicit and explicit measures after ketamine infusion. Ketamine treatment reduced D scores compared to midazolam treatment for the depression IAT (p = 0.053) with an effect size of 0.65. There was also a trend toward a reduced D score for the suicide/death IAT, with an effect size of 0.50. Ketamine significantly reduced the MADRS scores (15.44 ± 10.07; 95% CI, 10.51 to 20.37) compared to midazolam (24.13 ± 12.08; 95% CI, 18.21 to 30.04), with a mean difference of –8.69 ± 15.08 (95% CI, –16.72 to –0.65; df = 15; p = 0.036). Correlation analysis between implicit measures (IATs) and explicit measures (MADRS, CDRS‐R, MASC 2, and MADRS item 10) are ongoing. Conclusions: We have demonstrated significant movement on both the implicit and explicit measures. It is critical to assess the relationship between implicit and explicit measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinking as clinical trials seek to improve upon sole reliance on subjective reports.

"1295","1","Greater empathy in MDMA users.^
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely known for its positive acute effects on social behaviour, such as increasing empathy, whilst also attenuating the negative impact of social exclusion. However there is a scarcity of research that investigates the long-term impact of recreational MDMA use on these fundamental social processes. Method: Sixty-seven individuals were split into three groups based on their drug-use history: poly-drug MDMA users (n = 25), poly-drug users who do not use MDMA (n = 19), alcohol-only users (n = 23), and were tested in an independent groups design. Participants completed both a self-report measure of emotional and cognitive empathy, along with the Multifaceted Empathy Task – a computerised assessment of empathy – and the Cyberball Game – a social exclusion paradigm. Results: MDMA users had significantly greater subjective emotional empathy, and greater cognitive empathy on the computer task compared with the poly-drug users who do not use MDMA. There were no significant differences in subjective responses to social exclusion between the groups. Indices of MDMA use did not correlate with empathy. Conclusions: Long-term MDMA users in this sample exhibited normal psychosocial functioning in regard to empathy and social pain and had higher subjective emotional empathy. This conflicts with previous suggestions that moderate, long-term MDMA use may cause heightened social distress, and is further evidence of the safety of the drug, which is relevant to considerations of its therapeutic use."
"3345","1","Ayahuasca: Psychological and Physiologic Effects, Pharmacology and Potential Uses in Addiction and Mental Illness.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca, a traditional Amazonian decoction with psychoactive properties, is made from bark of the Banisteriopsis caapi vine (containing beta-carboline alkaloids) and leaves of the Psychotria viridis bush (supplying the hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine, DMT). Originally used by indigenous shamans for the purposes of spirit communication, magical experiences, healing, and religious rituals across several South American countries, ayahuasca has been incorporated into folk medicine and spiritual healing, and several Brazilian churches use it routinely to foster a spiritual experience. More recently, it is being used in Europe and North America, not only for religious or healing reasons, but also for recreation. OBJECTIVE: To review ayahuasca's behavioral effects, possible adverse effects, proposed mechanisms of action and potential clinical uses in mental illness. METHOD: We searched Medline, in English, using the terms ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, Banisteriopsis caapi, and Psychotria viridis and reviewed the relevant publications. RESULTS: The following aspects of ayahuasca are summarized: Political and legal factors; acute and chronic psychological effects; electrophysiological studies and imaging; physiological effects; safety and adverse effects; pharmacology; potential psychiatric uses. CONCLUSION: Many years of shamanic wisdom have indicated potential therapeutic uses for ayahuasca, and several present day studies suggest that it may be useful for treating various psychiatric disorders and addictions. The side effect profile appears to be relatively mild, but more detailed studies need to be done. Several prominent researchers believe that government regulations with regard to ayahuasca should be relaxed so that it could be provided more readily to recognized, credible researchers to conduct comprehensive clinical trials."
"3238","1","19.3 Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for MDD: current Evidence and Clinical Considerations.^
Objectives: Psilocybin‐assisted therapy is currently being investigated for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of MDD in adults. This talk will review the typical therapeutic approach, along with some of the major findings in this area to date, with a focus on the results from a prospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with moderate to severe depression who received 2 doses of psilocybin in a supported setting. Methods: This randomized, waiting‐list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21 to 75 years with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID‐HAMD ≥17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received 2 doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty‐four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose. Results: All 24 participants attended all follow‐up visits through the 12‐month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID‐HAMD) scores were observed at 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (≥50% reduction in GRID‐HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long‐term follow‐up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after the sessions predicted increased well‐being at 12 months but did not predict improvement in depression. One‐third of the participants began treatment with an antidepressant medication during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients. Contextual factors and psychotherapy likely play a substantial role in the safety and efficacy of the treatment and will require careful consideration if this intervention is studied in younger patient populations.

"8421","0","MDMA exposure alters cognitive and electrophysiological sensitivity to rapid tryptophan depletion in rhesus monkeys.^
Repeated treatment with ()3,4-methylenedioylymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces lasting depletions in serotonin (5-HT) markers in the brains of New and Old World monkeys. We have previously shown that macaques treated with MDMA (4 days, 10 mg/kg im, b.i.d.), exhibit an immediate, similar to50% reduction of the 5-HT metabolite 5-hydroxymdoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and 76-93% reductions in neocortical 5-HT content postmortem, but no lasting behavioral deficits under unchallenged conditions. Those monkeys were, however, more behaviorally sensitive to challenge with the 5-HT2C agonist 1-(3-chlorophenyl)piperazine (mCPP) I year after the NMMA regimen. A rapid tryptophan-depletion protocol was employed to determine further if these MDMA-exposed monkeys are more behaviorally and electrophysiologically sensitive to perturbation of 5-HT neurotransmission. Acute intragastric administration of a tryptophan-deficient (TRYP-) mixture of amino acids resulted in significant reductions in CSF 5-HIAA in both MDMA-exposed and control monkeys. The TRYP- mixture also reduced the brainstem auditory-evoked potential (BSAEP) P4 latency in MDMA-exposed monkeys, similar to an effect observed for 13 weeks post-MDMA. Spatial working memory performance was improved by the TRYP- mixture in the control group, but not the NDMA-exposed monkeys. Other behavioral capabilities [visual recognition memory, reaction time (RT), reinforcer efficacy and fine motor control] were not significantly affected by the TRYP- mixture in either group of monkeys. Thus, underlying alterations in brain function resulting from prior exposure to MDMA, that were not observed under normal conditions, may be revealed following perturbation of 5-HT signaling. The BSAEP response and spatial working memory appear particularly sensitive to lasting functional differences associated with MDMA exposure. (C) 2003 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved."
"4661","1","Epidemiology of classic psychedelic substances: results from a Norwegian internet convenience sample.^
OBJECTIVE: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in investigating the use of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, knowledge about the epidemiology of classic psychedelics in the Nordic countries is limited. METHODS: We recruited adult, Norwegian participants who have had a memorable experience after taking a classic psychedelic substance. They filled in an anonymous internet survey with 119 items covering matters related to recreational use of psychedelics using a secure, web-based application. Data are presented by using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations). RESULTS: We recruited 841 participants, 770 (72% male; 88% 45 years or younger) of which were included in the data analysis. The intentions behind taking the psychedelic substance were mainly recreational (46.1%) or therapeutic (42.3%). Most participants reported that their most memorable experience was with psilocybin. As in modern era clinical trials, most participants were well-prepared before, did processing during, and did integration work after the experience, whereas only a minority were supported by a therapist. Self-perceived symptoms of various mental disorders and substance use disorders were prevalent in the sample. Most subjects reported improvements in their condition. Although adverse reactions were usually mild and short-lived, 4.2% lasted for 1 year or more. Persisting flashbacks were present for a year or more among 2.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional sample of Norwegian, self-selecting adults, we shed light on what characterizes the most memorable experience with a classic psychedelic substance, including short- and long-term risks and benefits. For the most part, the psychedelic experience led to improvements in self-perceived symptoms of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, a small subset experienced persisting adverse reactions."
"8248","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during smooth pursuit eye movements.^
The uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

"7726","1","Exploratory Controlled Study of the Migraine-Suppressing Effects of Psilocybin.^
While anecdotal evidence suggests that select 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor ligands, including psilocybin, may have long-lasting therapeutic effects after limited dosing in headache disorders, controlled investigations are lacking. In an exploratory double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, adults with migraine received oral placebo and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) in 2 test sessions spaced 2 weeks apart. Subjects maintained headache diaries starting 2 weeks before the first session until 2 weeks after the second session. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessions and several follow-up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures. Ten subjects were included in the final analysis. Over the 2-week period measured after single administration, the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin (mean, - 1.65 (95% CI: - 2.53 to - 0.77) days/week) than after placebo (- 0.15 (- 1.13 to 0.83) days/week; p = 0.003, t(9) = 4.11). Changes in migraine frequency in the 2 weeks after psilocybin were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during drug administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated; there were no unexpected or serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. This exploratory study suggests there is an enduring therapeutic effect in migraine headache after a single administration of psilocybin. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects is an important finding, urging further investigation into the mechanism underlying the clinical effects of select 5-HT(2A) receptor compounds in migraine, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions.

"1263","1","5-HT2A agonist drugs as new treatments in psychiatry.^
Psilocybin is a non‐selective serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in certain mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for a variety of conditions, including: end of life anxiety [1], obsessive compulsive disorder [2] and smoking [3] and alcohol dependence [4], with promising preliminary results. The present study aimed to investigate psilocybin's safety and efficacy in patients with unipolar treatment‐resistant depression. In this open‐label feasibility trial, 12 patients (6 females) with moderate to severe, unipolar, treatment‐resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Psychological support was provided before, during and after each session. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months posttreatment, with the QIDS‐16 serving as the primary outcome. Treatment was well‐tolerated by all of the patients. No unexpected and only a small number of minor adverse events were observed. Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference = ‐11.8, 95% CI, ‐5 to ‐17, Cohen's d = 3.4) and 3 months post‐treatment (mean QIDS difference = ‐9.2, 95% CI, +3 to ‐17, Cohen's d = 2.3). Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also observed. This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of a novel intervention for treatment‐resistant depression. It should motivate further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach."
"4294","1","Ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders: systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is an effective short-term treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. A key question is whether the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment improves outcomes or delays relapse. AIM: To identify all studies combining psychotherapy with ketamine for the treatment of psychiatric disorders to summarise their effects and make recommendations for future research. METHOD: The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022318120). Potential studies were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, the Cochrane library and Google Scholar. Eligible studies combined ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and did not use case reports or qualitative designs. Key findings relating to psychotherapy type, diagnosis, ketamine protocol, sequencing of psychotherapy and study design are reported. Risk of bias was assessed using modified Joanna Briggs critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Nineteen studies evaluating 1006 patients were included in the systematic review. A variety of supportive individual and group, manualised and non-manualised psychotherapies were used. The majority of studies evaluated substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine protocols and sequencing of ketamine/psychotherapy treatment varied substantially between studies. Outcomes were largely positive for the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of psychotherapy and ketamine offers promise for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but study heterogeneity prevents definitive recommendations for their integration. Larger randomised controlled trials using manualised psychotherapies and standardised ketamine protocols are recommended to clarify the extent to which the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine improves outcomes over ketamine treatment alone."

"641","1","Psilocybin in long-term meditators: effects on default mode network functional connectivity and retrospective ratings of qualitative experience.^
Aims: Descriptions of meditation experiences can bear striking similarity to descriptions of some experiences with classic (serotonergic) hallucinogens. Neuroimaging studies reveal striking overlap in the effects of psilocybin and the effects of meditation on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). This ongoing study explored the effects of psilocybin on subjective experience and DMN connectivity in long‐term meditators. Methods: 16 meditators (mean lifetime meditation = 4206 h) received either a placebo (n = 8) or a high dose psilocybin (n = 8) capsule before a laboratory session. Retrospective self‐report measures of subjective experience and resting‐state fMRI data were collected the day after the session. Seed‐based functional connectivity analyses were applied to fMRI data. Self‐report measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups. Results: Participants who received psilocybin attributed significantly greater meaning, spiritual significance, psychological challenge, and psychological insight to their session experiences than those who received placebo. 75% of participants in the psilocybin group rated the experience to be in the top 10 most meaningful experiences of their life. Participants who received psilocybin also showed lower functional connectivity between hippocampal and posterior DMN regions and greater functional connectivity among DMN regions than those who received placebo. Conclusions: Participants attributed substantial meaning to their high‐dose psilocybin experience, andshowedchanges in brain function the day after a high dose of psilocybin. Further research should explore the relationship of these enduring changes in brain function to abuse liability and therapeutic outcomes with psilocybin."
"9642","0","Changes in neuronal activity in rat primary cortical cultures induced by illicit drugs and new psychoactive substances (NPS) following prolonged exposure and washout to mimic human exposure scenarios.^
The use of new psychoactive substances (NPS) is increasing despite associated health risks and limited pharmacological and toxicological knowledge. Information is available mainly for acute effects on specific targets like monoamine transporters and receptors. Recently, we have shown the ability of several NPS and illicit drugs to modulate neuronal activity during acute exposure. While these acute measurements provide valuable information regarding the potency and possible structure-activity relationships, an exposure scenario more representative of human exposure would increase insight and aid translation to the human situation. Therefore, we investigated the effects on neuronal activity after acute (30 min) and prolonged (5 h) exposure to amphetamine-type stimulants, cathinones, hallucinogens, piperazines and cocaine using rat primary cortical cultures grown on multi-well microelectrode arrays. To investigate the reversibility of effects, activity was also measured after a washout period of 19 h. During acute exposure, all compounds concentration-dependently decreased neuronal activity. Compared to acute exposure, prolonged exposure did not further decrease neuronal activity. Following washout, effects of 3 out of 11 drugs (methamphetamine, cocaine, and benzylpiperazine) were fully reversible, whereas effects induced by MDMA, PMMA and α-PVP were partially reversible. Neuronal activity did not recover after 19 h washout following exposure to the highest concentration of MDPV, 2C-B, 25B-NBOMe, and TFMPP. On the contrary, exposure to low concentrations of methylone, and to some extent of 2C-B, increased neuronal activity after the washout period. Hazard characterization of emerging NPS should include at least an acute exposure to determine a potency rank order. Supplementing the (acute and prolonged) exposure scenario with a washout period allows investigation of the reversibility of effects. The possibility of a neuronal network to regain activity after drug exposure appears independent of drug class or IC50 values for acute and prolonged exposure. Even though neuronal activity (partly) recovers after washout following exposure to most drugs, it is perturbing that complete recovery of neuronal activity is observed only for a minority of the tested drugs. © 2019 The Authors"

The blocking effect of chlorpromazine on LSD-25 induced (single oral dose, 65 mcg) electroencephalographic and clinical changes was investigated in a group of 7 chronic schizophrenics and these results were compared with the responses of matched group of 7 normal volunteer subjects. EEG changes were evaluated by means of quantitative electroencephalography using computer period analysis. Schizophrenics were given LSD-25 orally, once during the fourth week of placebo and again during the fourth week of chlorpromazine treatment (400 mg. daily). Forty-five minutes after LSD-25 administration, following the placebo period, 13 of 19 variables exhibited statistically significant EEG changes (mainly an increase of fast frequencies and decrease of slow waves) in the schizophrenic population, while during chlorpromazine treatment these changes were blocked (none of the EEG changes reached a level of statistical significance). In normal subjects, changes in 4 of 19 variables (increase of fast frequencies) reached a level of statistical significance, however, psychic and autonomic symptoms were minimal. In schizophrenics autonomic functions and psychopathological symptoms were more apparent during the placebo period than during chlorpromazine treatment. During chronic chlorpromazine treatment clinical and EEG resistance to the effects of LSD-25 was observed in the measurements of both 45 minutes and 6 hours following LSD-25 administration. The relationship between resting EEG patterns and the clinical response to LSD-25 was also discussed. It was hypothesized that subjects with desynchronized fast EEGs are prone to have “bad trips” after LSD-25 administration. © 1972, American Medical Electroencephalographic Association.

"788","0","Locomotor effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its deuterated form in mice: Psychostimulant effects, stereotypy, and sensitization.^
Rationale: There is a renewed interest in the use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for treating psychiatric conditions. Although MDMA has entered phase II clinical trials and shows promise as an adjunct treatment, there is an extensive literature detailing the potential neurotoxicity and adverse neurobehavioral effects associated with MDMA use. Previous research indicates that the adverse effects of MDMA may be due to its metabolism into reactive catechols that can enter the brain and serve directly as neurotoxicants. One approach to mitigate MDMA’s potential for adverse effects is to reduce O-demethylation by deuterating the methylenedioxy ring of MDMA. There are no studies that have evaluated the effects of deuterating MDMA on behavioral outcomes. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to assess the motor-stimulant effects of deuterated MDMA (d2-MDMA) and compare them to MDMA in male mice. Methods: Two experiments were performed to quantify mouse locomotor activity and to vary the drug administration regimen (single bolus administration or cumulative administration).ResultsThe results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that d2-MDMA is less effective at eliciting horizontal locomotion than MDMA; however, the differences between the compounds diminish as the number of cumulative administrations increase. Both d2-MDMA and MDMA can elicit sensitized responses, and these effects cross-sensitize to the prototypical drug of abuse methamphetamine. Thus, d2-MDMA functions as a locomotor stimulant similar to MDMA, but, depending on the dosing regimen, may be less susceptible to inducing sensitization to stereotyped movements. Conclusions: These findings indicate that d2-MDMA is behaviorally active and produces locomotor effects that are similar to MDMA, which warrant additional assessments of d2-MDMA’s behavioral and physiological effects to determine the conditions under which this compound may serve as a relatively safer alternative to MDMA for clinical use.

OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic variants in glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl- d -aspartate type subunit 2B ( GRIN2B ), glutamate ionotropic receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid type subunit 1 ( GRIA1 ), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) genes on therapeutic response, remission, and total Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores after treatment with ketamine or esketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients. METHODS: Participants (N = 60) are from a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial comparing single-dose intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) to esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) for TRD. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale was applied at baseline, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days postinfusion to assess depressive symptoms. Blood samples were collected to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1805502 ( GRIN2B ), rs1994862 ( GRIA1 ), and rs6265 ( BDNF ). RESULTS: There was no association between rs1805502, rs1994862, or rs6265 polymorphisms and antidepressant response ( P = 0.909, P = 0.776, and P = 0.482, respectively), remission P = 0.790, P = 0.086, and P = 0.669), or Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores at each time point ( P = 0.907, P = 0.552, and P = 0.778). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6265, rs1805502, and rs1994862) and ketamine's therapeutic action in TRD patients. Further studies with larger samples are needed to clarify the utility of these genes of interest as predictors for antidepressant treatment."

RATIONALE & OBJECTIVES:  ± 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and psilocybin are currently moving through the US Food and Drug Administration's phased drug development process for psychiatric treatment indications: posttraumatic stress disorder and depression, respectively. The current standard of care for these disorders involves treatment with psychiatric medications (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), so it will be important to understand drug-drug interactions between MDMA or psilocybin and psychiatric medications. METHODS: In accordance with Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines, we queried the MEDLINE database via PubMed for publications of human studies in English spanning between the first synthesis of psilocybin (1958) and December 2020. We used 163 search terms containing 22 psychiatric medication classes, 135 specific psychiatric medications, and 6 terms describing MDMA or psilocybin. RESULTS: Forty publications were included in our systematic review: 26 reporting outcomes from randomized controlled studies with healthy adults, 3 epidemiologic studies, and 11 case reports. Publications of studies describe interactions between MDMA (N = 24) or psilocybin (N = 5) and medications from several psychiatric drug classes: adrenergic agents, antipsychotics, anxiolytics, mood stabilizers, NMDA antagonists, psychostimulants, and several classes of antidepressants. We focus our results on pharmacodynamic, physiological, and subjective outcomes of drug-drug interactions. CONCLUSIONS: As MDMA and psilocybin continue to move through the FDA drug development process, this systematic review offers a compilation of existing research on psychiatric drug-drug interactions with MDMA or psilocybin."

Treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have evolved significantly in the past 35 years. From what was historically viewed as a pervasive, intractable condition have emerged multiple evidence-based intervention options. These treatments, predominantly cognitive behavioral in orientation, provide significant symptom improvement in 50-60% of recipients. The treatment of PTSD with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy using a supportive, non-directive approach has yielded promising results. It is unknown, however, how different therapeutic modalities could impact or improve outcomes. Therefore, to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches, Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for PTSD (CBCT) was combined with MDMA in a small pilot trial. The current article provides a case study of one couple involved in the trial, chosen to provide a demographically representative example of the study participants and a case with a severe trauma history, to offer a detailed account of the methodology and choices made to integrate CBCT and MDMA, as well as an account of their experience through the treatment and their treatment gains. This article offers a description of the combination of CBCT for PTSD and MDMA, and demonstrates that it can produce reductions in PTSD symptoms and improvements in relationship satisfaction."
"2758","1","MDMA decreases the effects of simulated social rejection.^
3-4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases self-reported positive social feelings and decreases the ability to detect social threat in faces, but its effects on experiences of social acceptance and rejection have not been determined. We examined how an acute dose of MDMA affects subjective and autonomic responses to simulated social acceptance and rejection. We predicted that MDMA would decrease subjective responses to rejection. On an exploratory basis, we also examined the effect of MDMA on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic cardiac control often thought to index social engagement and emotional regulation. Over three sessions, healthy adult volunteers with previous MDMA experience (N=36) received capsules containing placebo, 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA under counter-balanced double-blind conditions. During expected peak drug effect, participants played two rounds of a virtual social simulation task called ""Cyberball"" during which they experienced acceptance in one round and rejection in the other. During the task we also obtained electrocardiograms (ECGs), from which we calculated RSA. After each round, participants answered questionnaires about their mood and self-esteem. As predicted, MDMA decreased the effect of simulated social rejection on self-reported mood and self-esteem and decreased perceived intensity of rejection, measured as the percent of ball tosses participants reported receiving. Consistent with its sympathomimetic properties, MDMA decreased RSA as compared to placebo. Our finding that MDMA decreases perceptions of rejection in simulated social situations extends previous results indicating that MDMA reduces perception of social threat in faces. Together these findings suggest a cognitive mechanism by which MDMA might produce pro-social behavior and feelings and how the drug might function as an adjunct to psychotherapy. These phenomena merit further study in non-simulated social environments."
"7266","0","Dopamine and sense of agency: Determinants in personality and substance use.^
Sense of agency refers to the feeling of control over one’s own actions. The strength of this sense varies inter-individually. This means that people differ in their perception concerning the intensity of their intentions and actions. The current study aims to determine the factors influencing this sense of agency on a personality level. Furthermore, it gives insight into the correlative relation between the strength of the sense of agency and substance use. The study involved 210 participants who were tested for the experiment (intentional binding paradigm for sense of agency, hand paradigm for intentionality bias, questionnaires FAD-Plus, NI-20, substance use). Significant determinants in personality were narcissism (vulnerable subtype) and substance use (consumption in general beyond cannabis, and particularly for the substances cannabis, ecstasy, and cocaine). Both personality types were associated with a weaker sense of agency compared to controls. For both results, alterations in the dopaminergic system need to be discussed. The present results confirm prior hypotheses that dopamine seems to play a crucial role in perception of agency. Possibly a higher accessibility of dopamine increases sense of agency (hyper-binding), whereas a lower accessibility of dopamine decreases sense of agency (hypo-binding). A second aim of the study was to see whether there is a connection between sense of agency and intentionality bias. The perception of intention in others differs widely; some people tend to see arbitrary or accidental actions as unintentional, and others quickly label actions as ‘intentional’ although the information is not distinct for a categorization. This cognitive error is called intentionality bias. Results could not confirm a relationship between the two constructs-one’s own intention and judging intention in others. This may be due to a lack of connection between the two constructs or to methodological aspects. Further directions and limitations are discussed."
"7946","1","A Pilot Study of Ketamine Infusion after Suicide Attempt: New Frontiers in Treating Acute Suicidality in a Real-World Medical Setting.^
Ketamine, in research settings, rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts 2-24 h after a single infusion in patients with high suicidal ideation. In this study, the authors investigate ketamine's effects on suicidality in a real-world sample of recent suicide attempters on a tertiary-care Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Using an open-label design, 16 transdiagnostic CL patients were recruited, 18-65 years old, to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post-infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures were compared to ratings taken at 24 h, 5 days, 12 days, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-infusion using paired t-tests. Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p's < 0.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen's d's: 1.7-8.8) at acute timepoints (24 h; 5 days). These gains were uniformly maintained to 6 months post-infusion. Open-label ketamine appeared to rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra-high-risk, heterogeneous, real-world sample. Ketamine infusion may therefore be a safe, feasible, viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among medically hospitalized patients after a suicide attempt, with potentially enduring benefits. The current pilot findings suggest ketamine could be readily integrated into the settings where high-risk CL patients already receive healthcare, with the potential to become an important and novel tool in the treatment of suicidality."
"4453","1","Two-dimensional gas chromatography/electron-impact mass spectrometry with cryofocusing for simultaneous quantification of MDMA, MDA, HMMA, HMA, and MDEA in human plasma.^
BACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug. Analysis of MDMA and metabolites in human plasma, particularly in pharmacokinetic studies, requires low limits of quantification. Two-dimensional GC/MS with cryofocusing is a chromatographic technique recognized for its increased selectivity and resolution. METHODS: This method simultaneously quantifies 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), MDMA, and its metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3- methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) in human plasma. With hydrochloric acid, we hydrolyzed 1 mL plasma, fortified with internal standard. Analytes were subjected to solidphase extraction, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride, and quantified using cryofocused 2-dimensional GC/MS operated in electron-impact selected ion-monitoring mode. RESULTS: Limits of quantification were 1.0 μg/L for MDA and 2.5 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, HMMA, and HMA. Calibration curves were linear to 100 μg/L for MDA and HMA and to 400 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, and HMMA, with r2 > 0.997. At 3 concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range of the assay, mean overall extraction efficiencies from plasma were ≥85% for all compounds of interest. Recoveries were 85.6% to 107.2% of target, and intra- and interassay imprecision (CV) was <8.5% for all drugs at 3 concentrations within the range of the assay. None of the 66 exogenous compounds tested interfered with analyte quantification. CONCLUSIONS: This GC/MS assay provides low limits of quantification for simultaneous determination of MDEA, MDMA, and metabolites MDA, HMMA, and HMA in human plasma. The 2D chromatographic system should be suitable for application to other analytes and to other complex matrices. © 2007 American Association for Clinical Chemistry."
"185","1","Effects of ketamine and midazolam on resting state connectivity and comparison with ENIGMA connectivity deficit patterns in schizophrenia.^
Subanesthetic administration of ketamine is a pharmacological model to elicit positive and negative symptoms of psychosis in healthy volunteers. We used resting-state pharmacological functional MRI (rsPhfMRI) to identify cerebral networks affected by ketamine and compared them to the functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia. Ketamine can produce sedation and we contrasted its effects with the effects of the anxiolytic drug midazolam. Thirty healthy male volunteers (age = 19-37 years) underwent a randomized, three-way, cross-over study consisting of three imaging sessions, with 48 hr between sessions. A session consisted of a control period followed by infusion of placebo or ketamine or midazolam. The ENIGMA rsfMRI pipeline was used to derive two long-distance (seed-based and dual-regression) and one local (regional homogeneity, ReHo) FC measures. Ketamine induced significant reductions in the connectivity of the salience network (Cohen's d: 1.13 ± 0.28, p = 4.0 × 10(-3) ), auditory network (d: 0.67 ± 0.26, p = .04) and default mode network (DMN, d: 0.63 ± 0.26, p = .05). Midazolam significantly reduced connectivity in the DMN (d: 0.77 ± 0.27, p = .03). The effect sizes for ketamine for resting networks showed a positive correlation (r = .59, p = .07) with the effect sizes for schizophrenia-related deficits derived from ENIGMA's study of 261 patients and 327 controls. Effect sizes for midazolam were not correlated with the schizophrenia pattern (r = -.17, p = .65). The subtraction of ketamine and midazolam patterns showed a significant positive correlation with the pattern of schizophrenia deficits (r = .68, p = .03). RsPhfMRI reliably detected the shared and divergent pharmacological actions of ketamine and midazolam on cerebral networks. The pattern of disconnectivity produced by ketamine was positively correlated with the pattern of connectivity deficits observed in schizophrenia, suggesting a brain functional basis for previously poorly understood effects of the drug."

Anhedonia – the reduced ability to experience or respond to pleasure – is an important symptom domain for many psychiatric disorders. It is particularly relevant to depression and other mood disorders and it is a diagnostic criterion of a major depressive episode. Developing safe and effective pharmacological interventions for anhedonia is a critical public health need. The current chapter will review the state of the field with respect to both the efficacy of currently available pharma-cotherapies for anhedonia and the recent clinical research focusing on new brain targets, including the kappa-opioid receptor and the KCNQ2/3 receptors. The evidence for anti-anhedonic effects of ketamine and psychedelic agents will be reviewed, as well."
"7529","1","Depression and Anxiety Subgroups Across Alcohol Use Disorder and Substance Use in a National Epidemiologic Study.^
Objective: The high prevalence of alcohol/substance use among individuals with psychiatric disorders elucidates the import of investigations into associations between types and severity of psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. This study examined the likelihood of alcohol use disorder and substance use among individuals with varying depression and anxiety symptoms and severity thereof. Differences across sex were also examined. Methods: Using data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative sample from the United States (N = 43,093), separate logistic regressions estimated the odds of lifetime alcohol use disorder, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, and comorbid substance use across psychiatric symptom clusters controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity. Results: Symptom severity was a more important correlate of alcohol use disorder and substance use than symptom type. In particular, the odds ratio of lifetime use of depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens, or any combination of these types of substances were higher for individuals with either severe depression or severe depression and anxiety relative to a healthy control. Moreover, the odds of having a diagnosis of lifetime alcohol use disorder were higher for individuals with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and both depression and anxiety, relative to healthy individuals. Those with mild depression were more likely to engage in substance use than individuals with anxiety alone. Patterns of association among males and females were highly consistent. Conclusions: The findings highlight an enhanced risk of alcohol and substance use among individuals with severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms above what is seen among individuals with less severe symptomatology. In addition, this study shows a unique risk posed by the presence of depression on substance use. This study offers a framework for future studies to examine the causal mechanisms explaining the connection between psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"5381","1","Psilocybin induces acute and persisting alterations in immune status in healthy volunteers: An experimental, placebo-controlled study.^
Patients characterized by stress-related disorders such as depression display elevated circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a hyperactive HPA axis. Psychedelics are demonstrating promising results in treatment of such disorders, however the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects are still unknown. To date the evidence of acute and persisting effects of psychedelics on immune functioning, HPA axis activity in response to stress, and associated psychological outcomes is preliminary. To address this, we conducted a placebo-controlled, parallel group design comprising of 60 healthy participants who received either placebo (n = 30) or 0.17 mg/kg psilocybin (n = 30). Blood samples were taken to assess acute and persisting (7 day) changes in immune status. Seven days' post-administration, participants in each treatment group were further subdivided: 15 underwent a stress induction protocol, and 15 underwent a control protocol. Ultra-high field (7-Tesla) magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess whether acute changes in glutamate or glial activity were associated with changes in immune functioning. Finally, questionnaires assessed persisting self-report changes in mood and social behavior. Psilocybin immediately reduced concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), while other inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)- 1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)) remained unchanged. Seven days later, TNF-α concentrations returned to baseline, while IL-6 and CRP concentrations were persistently reduced in the psilocybin group. Changes in the immune profile were related to acute neurometabolic activity as acute reductions in TNF-α were linked to lower concentrations of glutamate in the hippocampus. Additionally, the more of a reduction in IL-6 and CRP seven days after psilocybin, the more persisting positive mood and social effects participants reported. Regarding the stress response, after a psychosocial stressor, psilocybin did not significantly alter the stress response. Results are discussed in regards to the psychological and therapeutic effects of psilocybin demonstrated in ongoing patient trials."
"9037","1","Verbal working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA.^
Previous research suggests that MDMA users are impaired in various aspects of cognitive functioning, however, it remains unclear whether they might experience deficits in established measures of verbal working memory functioning. In the present study current and previous MDMA users were compared with non-users on verbal working memory measures including reading and computation span. Both user groups were found to be impaired on the computation span measure while current users also exhibited impairment in reading span. The MDMA-related deficit on the computation span measure remained significant following the introduction of statistical controls for the potentially confounding effects of cannabis and other drugs. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on executive processes. It is suggested that MDMA may produce differential effects on specific components within a fractionated executive system. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"5911","0","Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination as a novel pharmacotherapeutic approach in patients with treatment resistant depression: a proof of concept clinical trial.^
Background: Currently available treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are only partially effective, with one third of patients not achieving adequate symptom control. For this group of patients suffering from treatmentresistant depression (TRD), novel treatments that act through non‐monoaminergic mechanisms are urgently needed. Notably, prior studies have demonstrated that the glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine displays rapid‐acting and robust antidepressant effects, even in patients suffering from TRD. In the current study we endeavored to examine the effects of a combination of dextromethorphan (DM) and the CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor quinidine (Q) in patients with TRD. Dextromethorphan modulates signaling at the NMDA receptor, in addition to other pharmacodynamics properties that include activity at sigma‐1 receptors and at the serotonin transporter. Quinidine inhibits the hepatic metabolism of DM, thereby increasing circulating concentrations of the latter. A combination product of DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg given every 12 hours is approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). In the current study, we tested the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Methods: The current study consisted of an open‐label proof of concept (POC) clinical trial of DM/Q for up to 10 weeks in patients with unipolar TRD, either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy. Patients initiated study drug at 20/10 mg daily for 7 days, then increased to 20/10 mg every 12 hours for 7 days, then increased to a maximum dose of 45/10 mg every 12 hours if tolerated. The minimum required dose to remain in the study was 20/10 mg every 12 hours. Eligibility criteria included men and women between the ages of 18 and 65, a primary diagnosis of MDD as determined by the SCID, and a history of non‐response to two or more prior adequate antidepressant trials as determined by Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATFH) criteria. Safety and tolerability outcomes were assessed by discontinuation rate, frequency of adverse events [using the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE)], and score change on the Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‐SSRS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Positive Subscale (BPRS+), and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Efficacy was assessed as change in MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Additional efficacy and functional measures included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology‐Self Report (QIDS‐SR), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). All analyses were conducted on the intention to treat (ITT) sample, with last observation carried forward for missing data. Results: Twenty patients with TRD (11 women; mean age: 49.4 ± 7.7 years) were started on DM/Q therapy and represent the ITT sample. Six patients discontinued prior to study completion, yielding a completer sample of 14 patients (70% retention). The most common adverse events were nausea and constipation, which each occurred in 3 patients. One serious adverse event occurred, representing hospitalization for insomnia and worsening depression three days after starting the study medication; this event was considered unlikely to be related to the study medication. There was no treatment‐emergent suicidal ideation or changes in BPRS+ or CADSS score. MADRS score was reduced from baseline to the 10‐week primary outcome (mean change: 12.95 ± 11.52, t(df = 19) = 5.04, po.001), as was QIDS‐SR score (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). The overall response rate was 45% (as defined by a 50% decrease in MADRS score from baseline to primary outcome). HAM‐A score was reduced from baseline to primary outcome (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). Disability lessened from baseline to primary outcome as measured by the SDS (po.001). Conclusions: Herein we report acceptable tolerability and safety and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg administered every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Future larger placebo controlled randomized trials in this population are warranted."
"9010","1","A comparison of two different doses of rectal ketamine added to 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine in infants and young children.^
In some circumstances, a high degree of sedation that results in a child being unconscious at the time of parental separation is desirable. We set out to investigate the efficacy and safety of a rectal premedication regimen designed to produce this increased level of sedation. Sixty-seven children aged two to 24 months were randomised into two groups. Group MK received 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine and group MKK received 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine per rectum. The sedation score at the time of parental separation 30 minutes after drug administration and the response to intravenous cannulation were evaluated on a four-point scale. Respiratory rate, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded immediately before parental separation. More patients in group MKK were asleep during separation (62 vs 35%, P < 0.05). Fewer patients in group MKK cried during intravenous cannulation (37 vs 68%, P < 0.05). Sedation scores were significantly increased at both time points. There was no difference between groups in vital signs at the time of parental separation and no adverse respiratory events occurred during the study period. In cases where a high degree of sedation following premedication in infants and toddlers is desired, the addition of 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine to 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine administered rectally is more efficacious than 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine."
"9282","1","5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effects of past ecstasy use on verbal memory performance in adolescent and emerging adults: A pilot study.^
Objective Ecstasy use is associated with memory deficits. Serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms have been linked with memory function in healthy samples. The present pilot study investigated the influence of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on memory performance in ecstasy users, marijuana-using controls, and non-drug-using controls, after a minimum of 7 days of abstinence. Method Data were collected from 116 young adults (18-25 years-old), including 45 controls, 42 marijuana users, and 29 ecstasy users, and were balanced for 5-HTTLPR genotype. Participants were abstinent seven days prior to completing memory testing. Three MANCOVAs and one ANCOVA were run to examine whether drug group, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and their interactions predicted verbal and visual memory after controlling for gender, past year alcohol use, other drug use, and nicotine cotinine levels. Results MANCOVA and ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant interaction between drug group and genotype (p = .03) such that ecstasy users with the L/L genotype performed significantly worse on CVLT-2 total recall (p = .05), short (p = .008) and long delay free recall (p = .01), and recognition (p = .006), with the reverse pattern found in controls. Ecstasy did not significantly predict visual memory. 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly predicted memory for faces (p = .02); short allele carriers performed better than those with L/L genotype. Conclusions 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the effects of ecstasy on verbal memory, with L/L carriers performing worse compared to controls. Future research should continue to examine individual differences in ecstasy's impact on neurocognitive performance as well as relationships with neuronal structure. Additional screening and prevention efforts focused on adolescents and emerging adults are necessary to prevent ecstasy consumption."
"6449","1","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^
Ketamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone."

Data from the Eysenck Personality Inventory, the Zuckerman Sensation-Seeking Scale, the Marlowe-Crowne Social Desirability Scale, and the Taylor Manifest Anxiety Scale were subjected to multivariate analyses to determine the amount of variance accounted for by each subtest. The analyses revealed that use of psychedelics, depending on the type of drug, is strongly associated with a person's need to seek out new and often unconventional experiences, that marijuana users can be differentiated from users of other hallucinogenic drugs by their characteristics of seeking social approval and displaying uninhibited modes of self-expression, and that the use of other psychedelics is associated with manifest anxiety and with general tendencies to seek out social stimulation and extroversion/introversion, but not with approval seeking or uninhibitedness."
"3125","0","Chronic cerebral effects of alcohol and drug abuse.^
A minority of alcohol abusers develop severe cerebral dysfunction in the form of Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. There is also evidence to suggest that cerebral dysfunction, particularly impaired abstracting ability, occurs in that larger population of heavy drinkers who do not go on to develop the Wernicke-Korsakoff syndrome. There is no consistent evidence that long-term marijuana, hallucinogen, or sedative use causes lasting neuropsychological disturbance. The deficits in abstract thinking reported by some LSD studies are similar to deficits others have reported among alcoholics. Since the LSD studies were not controlled for alcohol use, their interpretation is difficult. It appears that cerebrovascular accidents occur more frequently and at a younger age among amphetamine abusers. There is no reliable information about possible other long-term effects of stimulants on the brain per se (i.e., nonvascular complications). Abuse of intravenous narcotics has been associated with case reports of transverse myelitis and encephalitis. It is not known whether this pathology is a direct or hypersensitivity effect of narcotic drugs, of adulterants, or of infection."

The aim of this exploratory analysis was to evaluate cannabis exposure, reasons for use and problematic cannabis use among adult primary care patients in Washington state (United States) who co-use cannabis and nicotine (tobacco cigarettes and/or nicotine vaping) compared to patients who endorse current cannabis use only. As part of a NIDA Clinical Trials Network (CTN) parent study, patients who completed a cannabis screen as part of routine primary care were randomly sampled (N = 5,000) to a receive a confidential cannabis survey. Patients were stratified and oversampled based on the frequency of past-year cannabis use and for Black, indigenous, or other persons of color. Patients who endorsed past 30-day cannabis use are included here (N = 1388). Outcomes included; prevalence of cannabis use, days of cannabis use per week and times used per day, methods of use, THC:CBD content, non-medical and/or medical use, health symptoms managed, and cannabis use disorder (CUD) symptom severity. We conducted unadjusted bivariate analyses comparing outcomes between patients with cannabis and current nicotine co-use to patients with cannabis-only use. Nicotine co-use (n = 352; 25.4 %) was associated with differences in method of cannabis use, THC:CBD content, days of use per week and times used per day, number of health symptoms managed, and CUD severity (all p < 0.001), compared to primary care patients with cannabis-only use (n = 1036). Interventions targeting cannabis and nicotine co-use in primary care are not well-established and further research is warranted given findings of more severe cannabis use patterns and the adverse health outcomes associated with co-use."
"8100","1","Characterization and prediction of acute and sustained response to psychedelic psilocybin in a mindfulness group retreat.^
Meditation and psychedelics have played key roles in humankind's search for self-transcendence and personal change. However, neither their possible synergistic effects, nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied. To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315 μg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n = 39) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes. A better comprehension of mechanisms underlying most beneficial psychedelic experiences may guide therapeutic interventions across numerous mental conditions in the form of psychedelic-assisted applications."
"1203","0","High with Salvia divinorum.^
Salvia divinorum (SD) has been used for centuries in Mexico for spiritual and medicinal purposes. Recently, SD gained some popularity among adolescents and young adults for its potent hallucinogenic effects, its accessibility, its legal status in some countries, the perception of relative safety and the inability of standard tests to detect the drug. The active component of SD is salvinorin A, a potent agonist of kappa-opioid receptors in the brain and spinal cord. Salvinorin A has no structural resemblance to other hallucinogens, but an important overlapping occurs in its clinical effects. The inhalation of the vaporized smoke of SD products is the most efficient method to experience short-lived, but intense psychedelic effects. Besides the positive psychoactive effects, users frequently mention negative effects, such as loss of control over the experience, frightening hallucinations, panic attacks and dysphoria. Some cases of acute psychosis have been reported. As there is no known antidote, the management is limited to supportive care according to the clinical presentation. Mainly because there are insufficient data on the short- and long-term effects to determine its definitive dangers, the use of SD is a healthcare issue. Several reports, however, suggest that salvinorin A has a low addiction liability and that a life-threatening overdose is improbable. As recreational SD use is frequently associated with depression, alcohol abuse, tobacco and illicit drugs, SD is still on the list of drugs of concern. Consequently, further basic and clinical studies are needed. Likewise, the knowledge of the effects of SD among caregivers should be improved."
"4063","1","Time course of pharmacokinetic and hormonal effects of inhaled high-dose salvinorin A in humans.^
Salvinorin A is a kappa opioid agonist and the principal psychoactive constituent of the Salvia divinorum plant, which has been used for hallucinogenic effects. Previous research on salvinorin A pharmacokinetics likely underestimated plasma levels typically resulting from the doses administered due to inefficient vaporization and not collecting samples during peak drug effects. Six healthy adults inhaled a single high dose of vaporized salvinorin A (n = 4, 21 mcg/kg; n = 2, 18 mcg/kg). Participant- and monitor-rated effects were assessed every 2 min for 60 min post-inhalation. Blood samples were collected at 13 time points up to 90 min post-inhalation. Drug levels peaked at 2 min and then rapidly decreased. Drug levels were significantly, positively correlated with participant and monitor drug effect ratings. Significant elevations in prolactin were observed beginning 5 min post-inhalation and peaking at 15 min post-inhalation. Cortisol showed inconsistent increases across participants. Hormonal responses were not well correlated with drug levels. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct relationship between changes in plasma levels of salvinorin A and drug effects in humans. The results confirm the efficacy of an inhalation technique for salvinorin A."
"4905","1","The potential role of lysergic acid diethylamide for psychological assisted therapy: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in healthy volunteers.^
OBJECTIVE: In recent years, interest in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and corresponding therapy has increased rapidly. In this meta-analysis, we explored the effects of LSD on healthy subjects with respect to subjective drug effects, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of LSD in healthy people. Subsequently, 5 RCTs with 132 healthy people which focused on the effects of LSD were enrolled in our study. RESULT: We found that taking 50, 100 and 200 mcg LSD doses were associated with a significant increase in the maximal difference from the baseline compared to the placebo group among the outcomes of AMRS (Adjective Mood Rating Scale) score. Significant differences existed between the LSD and placebo groups when taking 100 and 200 mcg LSD in acute adverse effects (100 mcg: SMD = .97, 95% confidence interval [CI], .50, 1.44, Z = 4.04, p < .001; 200 mcg: SMD = 1.18, 95% CI, 0.65, 1.72, Z = 4.32, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the subjective effects of LSD in healthy people revealed moderate significant effect sizes in favor of LSD with no significant adverse effects. A 100 mcg dose of LSD has potential for use in psychological-assisted therapy and may improve the mental fitness of patients with disease-related psychiatric distress. Additional clinical trials are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of LSD as a psychological-assisted therapy."

The therapeutic potential of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca has been investigated in preclinical and clinical studies. Currently, the most consistent evidence refers to depression. However, various studies suggest that ayahuasca may comprise therapeutic benefits in other health conditions. This narrative review provides a comprehensive, up-to-date overview of ayahuasca's therapeutic effects in diverse clinical conditions in human (clinical, cross-sectional, observational, and qualitative) and preclinical (animal and in vitro) studies. In addition to summarizing and discussing the most commonly studied conditions, such as depression, anxiety, and substance use disorders (SUD), we also examine less frequently studied psychiatric, neurological, and physical conditions. Moreover, we discuss evidence from epidemiological studies on the impact of regular, long-term ayahuasca use on health and psychosocial outcomes. Overall, evidence for depression and SUD is more consistent, with numerous and diverse studies. However, a growing body of evidence suggests that other conditions equally relevant to public health might be promising targets for ayahuasca's therapeutic effects. This includes preliminary studies indicating potential for grief, eating disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder, personality disorders, Parkinson's and Alzheimer's disease, and severe physical illnesses (e.g., cancer, chronic conditions). Moreover, preliminary evidence in long-term ayahuasca users does not suggest detrimental effects but possible benefits for individual and collective health. In light of the emerging evidence of psychedelic drugs as therapeutic agents, it is essential to further investigate in rigorous designs the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in conditions other than depression."
"929","0","Hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextraction and gas chromatography-mass spectrometric determination of amphetamines in whole blood.^
Here, we present a fully validated method using a hollow-fibre liquid-phase microextraction technique for the determination by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC–MS) of amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MET), fenproporex (FEN), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA) in whole blood. The validation parameters presented successful values within those recommended by the Scientific Working Group for Forensic Toxicology (SWGTox) in the Standard Practices for Method Validation in Forensic Toxicology. The limits of detection ranged from 1 to 3 ng/mL, and the limits of quantification ranged from 2 to 5 ng/mL. The determination coefficients (r2) ranged from 0.990 to 0.997, and the method presented good intraday and interday accuracy (from 90.4% to 97.2%) and satisfactory recovery (from 68% to 110%). No carryover was observed. The heteroscedasticity was tested, and only AMP presented homoscedasticity. Weighting factors were applied to correct the linearity of MET (1/x2), MDA (1/x), FEN (1/x1/2), MDMA (1/x2) and MDEA (1/y). Dilution integrity was tested at ratios of 1:2, 1:5 and 1:10, and all maintained intraday precision (from 94.9% to 99.3%) and interday precision (from 89.4% to 94.9%). The validated method was applied to six real whole blood samples from individuals suspected of consuming ecstasy, and MDMA, MDA and amphetamine were successfully identified and quantified."
"4070","1","Powerful substances in tiny amounts: An interview study of psychedelic microdosing.^
Aims: This article presents a qualitative interview study of people who microdose with psychedelic drugs, which means that the user takes about one tenth of an ordinary recreational dose. Design: Respondents (n = 21) were recruited at several Internet fora for individual interviews via private messaging. Every participant was male, and the median respondent was in his 30s with a stable job and relationship and extensive entheogen experience. Results: Respondents tended to experiment with microdosing in phases, reporting mostly positive consequences from this form of drug use. Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing. Conclusion: The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning. While the study's findings are not generalisable, they may inform subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses."
"670","1","Urine Mescaline Screening With a Biochip Array Immunoassay and Quantification by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.^
Mescaline, the primary psychoactive chemical in peyote cactus, has been consumed for thousands of years in ancient religious ceremonies. The US military wanted to determine if mescaline intake was a problem for personnel readiness. Twenty thousand seventeen urine specimens negative for cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines were tested for mescaline with the Randox Drugs of Abuse V (DOA-V) biochip array immunoassay at the manufacturer's recommended cutoff of 6 mcg/L. A sensitive and specific method for mescaline quantification in urine was developed and fully validated. Extracted analytes were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and pentafluoropropanol and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron impact ionization. Standard curves, using linear least squares regression with 1/x weighting, were linear from 1 to 250 mcg/L with coefficients of determination >0.994. Intra- and inter-assay imprecision was <4.4 coefficient of variation (%CV), with accuracies >90.4%. Mean extraction efficiencies were >92.0% across the linear range. This fully validated method was applied for the confirmation of urinary mescaline in 526 presumptive-positive specimens and 198 randomly selected presumptive-negative specimens at the manufacturer's 6 mcg/L cutoff. No specimen confirmed positive at the GC/MS limit of quantification of 1 mcg/L. Results indicated that during this time frame, there was insufficient mescaline drug use in the military to warrant routine screening in the drug testing program. However, mescaline stability, although assessed, could have contributed to lower prevalence. We also present a validated GC/MS method for mescaline quantification in urine for reliable confirmation of suspected mescaline intake."
"3313","0","The Glutamatergic System in Treatment-Resistant Depression and Comparative Effectiveness of Ketamine and Esketamine: Role of Inflammation?.^
The glutamatergic system is the primary excitatory pathway within the CNS and is responsible for cognition, memory, learning, emotion, and mood. Because of its significant importance in widespread nervous system function, it is tightly regulated through multiple mechanisms, such as glutamate recycling, microglial interactions, and inflammatory pathways. Imbalance within the glutamatergic system has been implicated in a wide range of pathological conditions including neurodegenerative conditions, neuromuscular conditions, and mood disorders including depression. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mood disorder worldwide, has a high prevalence rate, and afflicts approximately 280 million people. While there are numerous treatments for the disease, 30-40% of patients are unresponsive to treatment and deemed treatment resistant; approximately another third experience only partial improvement (World Health Organization, Depression fact sheet [Internet], 2020). Esketamine, the S-enantiomer of ketamine, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) in 2019 and has offered new hope to patients. It is the first treatment targeting the glutamatergic system through a complex mechanism. Numerous studies have implicated imbalance in the glutamatergic system in depression and treatment resistance. Esketamine and ketamine principally work through inhibition of the NMDA receptor, though more recent studies have implicated numerous other mechanisms mediating the antidepressant efficacy of these agents. These mechanisms include increase in brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), activation of mammalian target of the rapamycin complex (mTORC), and reduction in inflammation. Esketamine and ketamine have been shown to decrease inflammation in numerous ways principally through reducing pro-inflammatory cytokines (e.g., TNF-alpha, IL-6) (Loix et al., Acta Anaesthesiol Belg 62(1):47-58, 2011; Chen et al., Psychiatry Res 269:207-11, 2018; Kopra et al., J Psychopharmacol 35(8):934-45, 2021). This anti-inflammatory effect has also been shown to be involved in the antidepressive properties of both ketamine and esketamine (Chen et al., Psychiatry Res 269:207-11, 2018; Kopra et al., J Psychopharmacol 35(8):934-45, 2021)."
"1254","1","Subjective features of the psilocybin experience that may account for its self-administration by humans: a double-blind comparison of psilocybin and dextromethorphan.^
RATIONALE: Although both psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) produce psychedelic-like subjective effects, rates of non-medical use of psilocybin are consistently greater than DXM. OBJECTIVE: New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non-medical use. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength. Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin: liking, visual effects, positive mood, insight, positive social effects, increased awareness of beauty (both visual and music), awe/amazement, meaningfulness, and mystical experience. For most ratings, (1) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo; (2) psilocybin showed dose-related increases; 3, DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin; (4) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM. These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects (alternatively described as the ""motivation"" to use). Observed differences on these domains between psilocybin and DXM are consistent with the relative rates of non-medical use of psilocybin and DXM."
"2161","1","MDMA Impairs Both the Encoding and Retrieval of Emotional Recollections.^
The psychoactive drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasingly used for its perceived emotional effects (eg, prosociality, empathy, psychotherapy), but surprisingly little research has been aimed at identifying the effect of the drug on emotional episodic memory in humans. Here, we report the first double-blind placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of MDMA on emotional memory separately during encoding and retrieval in healthy participants. Participants viewed emotionally negative, neutral, and positive pictures and their labels. Forty-eight hours later, they were given cued recollection and recognition memory tests designed to assess recollection and familiarity for the studied pictures. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups who received MDMA (1 mg/kg) either during encoding (Encoding group; N=20), retrieval (Retrieval group; N=20), or neither (Placebo group; N=20). Although MDMA administered at either phase did not affect overall memory accuracy, it did alter the recollection of details associated specifically with emotional memories as estimated using a dual process signal detection analysis of confidence judgments and subjective 'remember' judgments. In the Encoding group, MDMA reduced recollection estimates for negative and positive pictures but had little to no effect on neutral items or familiarity estimates. There was evidence for similar trends in the Retrieval group. These findings indicate that MDMA attenuates the encoding and retrieval of salient details from emotional events, consistent with the idea that its potential therapeutic effects for treating posttraumatic stress disorder are related to altering emotional memory."
"9420","1","Alcohol-like effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine in healthy individuals.^
The N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has been shown previously to produce alcohol‐like subjective effects in healthy individuals. The purpose of this study was to replicate this finding in a larger sample of healthy individuals. In addition, we compared ketamine response between family history positive (FHP) versus family history negative (FHN) subjects. A total of 99 non‐alcohol‐dependent healthy subjects with (n = 29) and without (n = 70) a family history of alcoholism were recruited from the community. Subjects were healthy males and females aged 21 to 30 years with no lifetime DSM‐IV Axis I psychiatric or substance use disorders. FHP subjects were required to have a biological father and another first‐ or second‐degree biological relative with a history of alcoholism. Subjects received either ketamine (0.81 mg/kg) or placebo (saline) intravenously in a randomized crossover design during two separate test sessions, at least 3 days apart. This subanesthetic dose of ketamine (0.81 mg/kg) was administered as an intravenous bolus of 0.23 mg/kg of ketamine over 1 min followed by an infusion of 0.58 mg/kg of ketamine intravenously over 60 min. Alcohol‐like effects were evaluated using the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale (BAES), the Visual Analogue Scales of Similarity to Drugs of Abuse (VASSDA), and the Number of Drinks Scale (NDS). Compared with placebo, ketamine produced significant effects associated with both the stimulant (ascending limb) and sedative (descending limb) effects of alcohol intoxication (p < 0.0001). Ketamine produced similar effects to alcohol using the VASSDA (p < 0.0001). There was a significant difference in FHP versus FHN in the similarity to alcohol, where the effects of ketamine were perceived as less similar to alcohol in FHP subjects than in FHN subjects (family history x medication x time effect: p < 0.05). The highest perceived number of alcoholic drinks was 8.1 drinks (SD = 10.2) for FHP subjects and 5.3 drinks (SD = 4.9) for FHN subjects 15 min after ketamine infusion. In summary, the NMDA glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine produced alcohol‐like effects in healthy subjects. In addition, there was evidence of altered ketamine response in FHP subjects as compared with FHN subjects, suggesting that antagonism of NMDA glutamate receptors is associated with subjective response to alcohol and with the heritable risk for alcoholism."
"1002","1","Human Metabolome Changes after a Single Dose of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with Special Focus on Steroid Metabolism and Inflammation Processes.^
The intake of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is known to increase several endogenous substances involved in steroid and inflammation pathways. Untargeted metabolomics screening approaches can determine biochemical changes after drug exposure and can reveal new pathways, which might be involved in the pharmacology and toxicology of a drug of abuse. We analyzed plasma samples from a placebo-controlled crossover study of a single intake of MDMA. Plasma samples from a time point before and three time points after the intake of a single dose of 125 mg MDMA were screened for changes of endogenous metabolites. An untargeted metabolomics approach on a high-resolution quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometer coupled to liquid chromatography with two different chromatographic systems (reversed-phase and hydrophobic interaction liquid chromatography) was applied. Over 10 000 features of the human metabolome were detected. Hence, 28 metabolites were identified, which showed significant changes after administration of MDMA compared with placebo. The analysis revealed an upregulation of cortisol and pregnenolone sulfate 4 h after MDMA intake, suggesting increased stress and serotonergic activity. Furthermore, calcitriol levels were decreased after the intake of MDMA. Calcitriol is involved in the upregulation of trophic factors, which have protective effects on brain dopamine neurons. The inflammation mediators hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, dihydroxyeicosatetraenoic acid, and octadecadienoic acid were found to be upregulated after the intake of MDMA compared with placebo, which suggested a stimulation of inflammation pathways."
"7980","1","Prolonged ketamine infusion modulates limbic connectivity and induces sustained remission of treatment-resistant depression.^
Ketamine produces a rapid antidepressant response in over 50% of adults with treatment-resistant depression. A long infusion of ketamine may provide durable remission of depressive symptoms, but the safety, efficacy, and neurobiological correlates are unknown. In this open-label, proof-of-principle study, adults with treatment-resistant depression (N = 23) underwent a 96-h infusion of intravenous ketamine (0.15 mg/kg/h titrated toward 0.6 mg/kg/h). Clonidine was co-administered to reduce psychotomimetic effects. We measured clinical response for 8 weeks post-infusion. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging was used to assess functional connectivity in patients pre- and 2 weeks post-infusion and in matched non-depressed controls (N = 27). We hypothesized that responders to therapy would demonstrate response-dependent connectivity changes while all subjects would show treatment-dependent connectivity changes. Most participants completed infusion (21/23; mean final dose 0.54 mg/kg/h, SD 0.13). The infusion was well tolerated with minimal cognitive and psychotomimetic side effects. Depressive symptoms were markedly reduced (MADRS 29 ± 4 at baseline to 9 ± 8 one day post-infusion), which was sustained at 2 weeks (13 ± 8) and 8 weeks (15 ± 8). Imaging demonstrated a response-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex to the default mode network, and a treatment-dependent decrease in hyperconnectivity within the limbic system (hippocampus, amygdala, medial thalamus, nucleus accumbens). In exploratory analyses, connectivity was increased between the limbic system and frontal areas, and smaller right hippocampus volume at baseline predicted larger MADRS change. A single prolonged infusion of ketamine provides a tolerated, rapid, and sustained response in treatment-resistant depression and normalizes depression-related hyperconnectivity in the limbic system and frontal lobe.

"4359","1","Effects of MDMA and Intranasal oxytocin on social and emotional processing.^
MDMA (± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'ecstasy') is used recreationally, reportedly because it increases feelings of empathy, sociability, and interpersonal closeness. One line of evidence suggests that MDMA produces these effects by releasing oxytocin, a peptide involved in social bonding. In the current study, we investigated the acute effects of MDMA and oxytocin on social and emotional processing in healthy human volunteers. MDMA users (N = 65) participated in a 4-session, within-between-subjects study in which they received oral MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), intranasal oxytocin (20 or 40 IU), or placebo under double-blind conditions. The primary outcomes included measures of emotion recognition and sociability (desire to be with others). Cardiovascular and subjective effects were also assessed. As expected, MDMA dose-dependently increased heart rate and blood pressure and feelings of euphoria (eg, 'High' and 'Like Drug'). On measures of social function, MDMA impaired recognition of angry and fearful facial expressions, and the larger dose (1.5 mg/kg) increased desire to be with others, compared with placebo. Oxytocin produced small but significant increases in feelings of sociability and enhanced recognition of sad facial expressions. Additionally, responses to oxytocin were related to responses to MDMA with subjects on two subjective measures of sociability. Thus, MDMA increased euphoria and feelings of sociability, perhaps by reducing sensitivity to subtle signs of negative emotions in others. The present findings provide only limited support for the idea that oxytocin produces the prosocial effects of MDMA."
"512","1","Abnormal visual experiences in individuals with histories of hallucinogen use: A web-based questionnaire.^
Despite longstanding reports of prolonged or reoccurring perceptual changes in a subset of hallucinogen users, very little is known about Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder and related visual abnormalities in hallucinogen users. We used an online questionnaire to document the symptoms and relationship to drug use of unusual visual phenomena in hallucinogen users. 16,192 individuals viewed the information sheet and 2679 were included in the study. Of these, 224 reported having unrelated diagnoses associated with unusual visual experiences and were excluded from main analyses. Most (60.6%) of the remaining 2455 participants reported having experienced drug-free visual experiences that resembled hallucinogen effects. Probability of experiencing constant or near-constant symptoms was predicted by greater past exposure to specific hallucinogens, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although symptoms were common, few (104, or 4.2% of the sample) found them distressing or impairing enough to consider seeking treatment. Visual changes in hallucinogen users may be more common than previously suspected and are worthy of further study. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
"6715","0","Adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and other psychiatric symptoms in recreational polydrug users.^
Aims Previous research has shown that recreational drug use is associated with more psychiatric symptoms and psychobiological distress. This study investigated whether symptoms of adult attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were also raised in polydrug users. Methods We assessed a non-clinical sample of 84 unpaid volunteers (mean age 27.5 years): n = 17 light-novice polydrug users; n= 29 moderate polydrug users; and n = 38 non-user controls (14 non-drug users, 24 alcohol/tobacco users). They completed the Symptom Checklist 90 (SCL-90) self-rating inventory for psychiatric symptoms, the Adult ADHD Self-report Scale symptom checklist for adult ADHD, and also the questions on positive moods and sociability. Saliva samples provided a neuroendocrine cortisol measure. Results Moderate polydrug users reported significantly higher adult ADHD symptoms and SCL-90 psychiatric symptoms and lower sociability than non-user controls and light polydrug users. Novice-light polydrug users did not differ from control groups on any measure. There were no significant group differences in cortisol. These findings are debated using the interactive diathesis-distress model. Psychoactive drugs can affect both mood and cognition. When taken regularly, the drug-induced psychobiological vacillation may exacerbate prior problems with mood stability and attentional-cognitive control. Conclusions It is not polydrug usage per se, but rather their regular-repeated usage, that is associated with increased signs of psychiatric and attentional-hyperactivity distress.

"8637","1","Prevalence of illicit drug use in young Australian women, patterns of use and associated risk factors.^
Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use in young Australian women, determine their patterns of drug use and identify associated risk factors. Methods: Data were collected in 2000 as part of the second survey of the youngest cohort in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (n = 9512). Results: Among women aged 22-27 years, 58% reported having used an illicit drug at some time with most (57%) having used cannabis. Amphetamines (16%), ecstasy/designer drugs (15%) and LSD (14%) were the next three most commonly used drugs. Four different patterns of drug use were identified: past users of cannabis only (39%); current users of cannabis only (17%); past multiple drug users (13%) and current multiple drug users (31%). Living in a defacto relationship or never being married, living with non-family members, a history of physical abuse, sexual intercourse, smoking and binge drinking were associated significantly with exclusive use of cannabis and with use of multiple drugs compared to never using illicit drugs. Living with a partner, experience of sexual or emotional abuse, pregnancy, diagnosis of depression and taking sleeping medication were associated significantly with being a multiple drug user, but not for exclusive cannabis use. Multiple drug users had, on average, used cannabis 2-3 years before using any other drug. Conclusions: Given the strong association found between smoking, heavy drinking and drug use of varied patterns, public health initiatives targeted at preventing young women from smoking and drinking should additionally target illicit drug use."
"9575","1","A comparative analysis of antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of repeated ketamine infusions in elderly and younger adults with depression.^
Objectives: This study aims to investigate the differences in safety and antidepressant effects of multi-infusion ketamine treatment between elderly and young adults with depression. Methods: The safety, antidepressant, and anti-suicidal effects of multi-infusion ketamine were compared between 19 elderly (≥50 years) and 116 younger (<50 years) adults with depression; all were treated with six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg). Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to measure the depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation was measured with Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)-part 1, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) item 3, and (MADRS) item 10. Dissociative and psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated based on the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-four items. Results: Multi-Ketamine infusions resulted in a lower (trend) antidepressant response (37.1 % versus 57.8 %) and antidepressant remission (15.8 % versus 47.4 %) in elderly patients with depression compared with younger patients with depression (all ps > 0.05). Interestingly, elderly patients with depression had a higher MADRS score after six ketamine infusions compared with younger patients (p = 0.04). No significant differences in SSI-part 1 scores, HAMD item 3 scores, MADRS item 10 scores, CADSS scores, and BPRS-four items scores were found between the two groups at any assessment point (all ps > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows that repeated-dose infusions of ketamine may be a feasible treatment strategy in elderly Chinese patients with depression; however, elderly patients with depression may be less responsive to ketamine compared with younger adults with depression."
"3572","0","Individual and combined effects of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol and cannabidiol on model psychosis and memory function.^
Purpose of the study: Chronic cannabis use has been implicated in the development of schizophrenia and this relationship may be mediated by psychosis proneness, another important factor may be varying levels of cannabinoids in the cannabis that is smoked. Delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) produces reliable increases in psychotomimetic symptoms, impairments in episodic memory and elicits positive and negative schizophrenia‐like symptoms, dose‐dependently [1]. Cannabidiol (CBD), another major cannabinoid in cannabis, is associated with pro‐cognitive effects [2] and can reduce positive and negative symptoms in those with Schizophrenia [3]. Methods: In a randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, crossover laboratory study, cannabis users (n = 48) from the community selected for (a) frequency of cannabis use (heavy, light) and (b) scores on the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (high, low) were administered a single dose of THC (8 mg), CBD (16 mg), a combination of THC+CBD (8 mg+16 mg) or placebo on four separate occasions (1 week wash out) via a vaporisor. Participants were administered the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) and immediate and delayed prose recall (episodic memory) on each day. Results:We found interactions between Drug and PSI subscales of Perceptual Distortion (THC: P = 0.006; THC+CBD: P = 0.005) and Cognitive Disorganisation (THC: P = 0.008; THC+CBD: P = 0.004). CBD produced no change in comparison to placebo. A Drug × Frequency of Use interaction emerged [F(2,105) = 3.582, P = 0.024] where CBD reduced PSI scores relative to placebo in recreational (P = 0.015) but not daily users (P = 0.104). We found a Drug By Schizotypy interaction [F(3,150) = 6.856, P<0.001] suggesting that high Schizotypes scored greater on PSI subscales of: Cognitive Disorganisation (P = 0.001), Anhedonia (P<0.001), Mania (P = 0.004), Paranoia (P = 0.007) in comparison to low Schizotypes. We also found a main effect of drug driven by increased scores following THC (P = 0.014) and THC+CBD (P = 0.022) but not CBD. The BPRS revealed higher scores for Positive relative to Negative items (P = 0.02). Both THC and THC+CBD increased scores on Negative items, but not Positive items. We found a main effect of Drug on prose recall reflecting poorer scores after THC (P = 0.031) and THC+CBD (P = 0.024) relative to placebo, but this was not the case for CBD. We also found a main effect of Delay, reflecting poorer scored in the delay relative to the immediate Prose Recall. Effects of THC on significant PSI subscales (Perceptual Distortion and Cognitive Disorganisation) were positively correlated with BPRS negative items and negatively correlated with delayed prose recall. Conclusions: Both the PSI and BPRS are sensitive to cannabinoid administration. THC increased overall scores on PSI, negative symptoms on BPRS, and robustly impaired episodic memory. CBD alone reduced PSI scores, but in recreational users only. At a ratio of 2:1, CBD did not attenuate the acute psychotic and memory impairing effects of vaporized THC alone. Correlations suggest suggests that vulnerability to the harmful effects of THC is common these measures (PSI, BPRS and prose recall). Antipsychotic effects of CBD may be lacking in frequent cannabis users, which is of concern due to the high rates of cannabis use in patients with schizophrenia."
