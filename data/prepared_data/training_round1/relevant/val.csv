"3179","1","Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance.^
RATIONALE: Although psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its acute and persisting effects. OBJECTIVES: This double-blind study evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were hallucinogen-naïve adults reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40 mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design, six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions. Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers. CONCLUSIONS: When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous scientific investigations of their causes and consequences."
"827","0","Increased hippocampal engagement during learning as a marker of sensitivity to psychotomimetic effects of δ-9-THC.^
BACKGROUND: Cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient δ-9-tetrahydrocannibidiol (THC) can induce transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate them in those with established psychosis. However, not everyone experience these effects, suggesting that certain individuals are particularly susceptible. The neural basis of this sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effects of THC is unclear. METHODS: We investigated whether individuals who are sensitive to the psychotomimetic effects of THC (TP) under experimental conditions would show differential hippocampal activation compared with those who are not (NP). We studied 36 healthy males under identical conditions under the influence of placebo or THC (10 mg) given orally, on two separate occasions, in a pseudo-randomized, double-blind, repeated measures, within-subject, cross-over design, using psychopathological assessments and functional MRI while they performed a verbal learning task. They were classified into those who experienced transient psychotic symptoms (TP; n = 14) following THC administration and those who did not (NP; n = 22). RESULTS: Under placebo conditions, there was significantly greater engagement of the left hippocampus (p < 0.001) in the TP group compared with the NP group during verbal encoding, which survived leave-one-out analysis. The level of hippocampal activation was directly correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.44, p = 0.008) with the severity of transient psychotic symptoms induced by THC. This difference was not present when we compared two subgroups from the same sample that were defined by sensitivity to anxiogenic effects of THC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that altered hippocampal activation during verbal encoding may serve as a marker of sensitivity to the acute psychotomimetic effects of THC."
"6172","1","Intravenous Esketamine on Prevention of Postoperative Depression in Patients Undergoing Cardiac Surgery.^
Single subanaesthetic doses of i.v. esketamine may significantly improve symptoms in psychiatric patients with major depression. In patients undergoing cardiac surgery, postoperative depressive symptoms are common. This study hypothesizes that low‐dose esketamine has a preventive effect on postoperative depression. However, evidence in this aspect is insufficient. The purpose of this study is to investigate the effect of a subanaesthetic dose of ketamine on POD for patients undergoing cardiac surgery."
"469","1","Oxytocin in response to MDMA provocation test in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): a single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.^
BACKGROUND: Disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can cause an arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus. Patients with this condition are at high risk of additional oxytocin deficiency owing to the close anatomical proximity of oxytocin-producing neurons; however, no conclusive evidence for such a deficiency has been reported. We aimed to use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), a strong activator of the central oxytocinergic system, as a biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to investigate oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). METHODS: This single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial included patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy controls (matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI) and was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. We used block randomisation to assign participants to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in the first experimental session; patients received the opposite treatment at the next session, with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between the two sessions. Participants and investigators assessing the outcomes were masked to assignment. Oxytocin concentrations were measured at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 min after MDMA or placebo. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma oxytocin concentration curve (AUC) after drug intake. The AUC was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed-effects model. Subjective drug effects were assessed throughout the study using ten-point visual analogue scales. Acute adverse effects were assessed before and 360 min after drug intake using a 66-item list of complaints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04648137. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2021, and May 1, 2022, we recruited 15 patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and 15 healthy controls. All participants completed the study and were included in the analyses. In healthy controls, median plasma oxytocin concentration was 77 pg/mL (IQR 59-94) at baseline and increased by 659 pg/mL (355-914) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 102 095 pg/mL (41 782-129 565); in patients, baseline oxytocin concentration was 60 pg/mL (51-74) and only slightly increased by 66 pg/mL (16-94) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 6446 pg/mL (1291-11 577). The effect of MDMA on oxytocin was significantly different between groups: the AUC for oxytocin was 82% (95% CI 70-186) higher in healthy controls than in patients (difference 85 678 pg/mL [95% CI 63 356-108 000], p<0·0001). The increase in oxytocin in healthy controls was associated with typical strong subjective prosocial, empathic, and anxiolytic effects, whereas only minimal subjective effects were observed in patients, in agreement with the lack of increase in oxytocin concentrations. The most frequently reported adverse effects were fatigue (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of appetite (ten [67%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of concentration (eight [53%] healthy controls and seven [47%] patients), and dry mouth (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients). In addition, two (13%) healthy controls and four (27%) patients developed transient mild hypokalaemia. INTERPRETATION: These findings are highly suggestive of clinically meaningful oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), laying the groundwork for a new hypothalamic-pituitary disease entity.

"8507","0","Current Perspective on MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^
The present paper discusses the current literature with regard to substance-assisted psychotherapy with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the development from MDMA's early application in psychotherapy to its present and future role in the treatment of PTSD. It is further attempted to increase the attention for MDMA's therapeutic potential by providing a thorough depiction of the scientific evidence regarding its theorized mechanism of action and potential harms of its application in the clinical setting (e.g., misattribution of therapeutic gains to medication instead of psychological changes). Empirical support for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, including the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails that have been conducted since 2008, is discussed. Thus far, an overall remission rate of 66.2% and low rates of adverse effects have been found in the six phase two trials conducted in clinical settings with 105 blinded subjects with chronic PTSD. The results seem to support MDMA's safe and effective use as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Even though preliminary studies may look promising, more studies of its application in a psychotherapeutic context are needed in order to establish MDMA as a potential adjunct to therapy."
"606","1","Assessment of alcohol and tobacco use disorders among religious users of ayahuasca.^
The aims of this study were to assess the impact of ceremonial use of ayahuasca-a psychedelic brew containing N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and β-carboline -and attendance at União do Vegetal (UDV) meetings on substance abuse; here we report the findings related to alcohol and tobacco use disorder. A total of 1,947 members of UDV 18+ years old were evaluated in terms of years of membership and ceremonial attendance during the previous 12 months. Participants were recruited from 10 states from all major regions of Brazil. Alcohol and tobacco use was evaluated through questionnaires first developed by the World Health Organization and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Analyses compared levels of alcohol and tobacco use disorder between the UDV and a national normative sample (n = 7,939). Binomial tests for proportions indicated that lifetime use of alcohol and tobacco was higher in UDV sample compared to the Brazilian norms for age ranges of 25-34 and over 34 years old, but not for the age range of 18-24 years old. However, current use disorders for alcohol and tobacco were significantly lower in the UDV sample than the Brazilian norms. Regression analyses revealed a significant impact of attendance at ayahuasca ceremonies during the previous 12 months and years of UDV membership on the reduction of alcohol and tobacco use disorder."
"2488","1","Phantom limb pain: sub hallucinogenic treatment with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD 25).^
Oral treatment of phantom limb pain in five males and two females ranging in age from 25 to 78 years with subhallucinogenic doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD-25) resulted in improvement in pain in five patients and reduction in use of analgesics. In two of the five patients improvement was striking and in the other three, pain and analgesic use were reduced moderately. LSD treatment was ineffective in two patients. Intravenous infusion or bolus injection of LSD-25, 10 ng/ml at 0.5 ml/min. resulted in facilitation of 5-HT venospasm. The findings suggest that LSD-25 facilitation of 5-HT activity occurs centrally consistent with the hypothesis of the central nature of phantom limb pain."
"9037","1","Verbal working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA.^
Previous research suggests that MDMA users are impaired in various aspects of cognitive functioning, however, it remains unclear whether they might experience deficits in established measures of verbal working memory functioning. In the present study current and previous MDMA users were compared with non-users on verbal working memory measures including reading and computation span. Both user groups were found to be impaired on the computation span measure while current users also exhibited impairment in reading span. The MDMA-related deficit on the computation span measure remained significant following the introduction of statistical controls for the potentially confounding effects of cannabis and other drugs. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on executive processes. It is suggested that MDMA may produce differential effects on specific components within a fractionated executive system. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"9491","0","A global systematic review and meta-analysis on illicit drug consumption rate through wastewater-based epidemiology.^
Wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) is a complementary, well-established comprehensive, cost-effective, and rapid technique for monitoring of illicit drugs used in a general population. This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to estimate the rank and consumption rate of illicit drugs through WBE studies. In the current study, the related investigations regarding the illicit drug consumption rate based on WBE were searched among the international databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Google scholar, and local database, Magiran from 2012 up to May 2019. The illicit drug consumption rate with 95% confidence intervals was pooled between studies by using random effect model. The heterogeneity was determined using I(2) statistics. Also, subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the possible effects of year and location of studies on observed heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of 37 articles indicates that the overall rank order of illicit drugs according to their pooled consumption rate can be summarized as tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis (7417.9 mg/day/1000 people) > cocaine (655.7 mg/day/1000 people) > morphine (384.9 mg/day/1000 people) > methamphetamine (296.2 mg/day/1000 people) > codeine (222.7 mg/day/1000 people) > methadone (200.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (126.3 mg/day/1000 people) > amphetamine (118.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (33.7 mg/day/1000 people). The pooled level rate was 190.16 mg/day/1000 people for benzoylecgonine (main urinary cocaine metabolite), 137.9 mg/day/1000 people for 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (main metabolite of cannabis), and 33.7 mg/day/1000 people for 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (main metabolite of methadone). The I(2) values for all selected drugs were 100% (P value < 0.001). The results of year subgroup indicated that the changes of heterogeneity for all selected drugs were nearly negligible. The heterogeneity within studies based on continents subgroup just decreased in America for drugs like 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (I(2) = 24.4%) and benzoylecgonine (I(2) = 94.1%). The outcome of this meta-analysis can be used for finding the illicit drugs with global serious problem in view of consumption rate (i.e., cannabis and cocaine) and helping authorities to combat them."
"2078","1","Dr. Leary's Concord Prison Experiment: a 34-year follow-up study.^
This study is a long-term follow-up to the Concord Prison Experiment, one of the best-known studies in the psychedelic psychotherapy literature. The Concord Prison Experiment was conducted from 1961 to 1963 by a team of researchers at Harvard University under the direction of Timothy Leary. The original study involved the administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy to 32 prisoners in an effort to reduce recidivism rates. This follow-up study involved a search through the state and federal criminal justice system records of 21 of the original 32 subjects, as well as personal interviews with two of the subjects and three of the researchers: Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Gunther Weil. The results of the follow-up study indicate that published claims of a treatment effect were erroneous. This follow-up study supports the emphasis in the original reports on the necessity of embedding psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy with inmates within a comprehensive treatment plan that includes post-release, nondrug group support programs. Despite substantial efforts by the experimental team to provide post-release support, these services were not made sufficiently available to the subjects in this study. Whether a new program of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy and post-release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed within the context of a new experiment."
"6844","0","Medicinal psychedelics for mental health and addiction: Advancing research of an emerging paradigm.^
The medical use of psychedelic substances (e.g. psilocybin, ayahuasca, lysergic acid diethylamide and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) is attracting renewed interest, driven by a pressing need for research and development of novel therapies for psychiatric disorders, as well as promising results of contemporary studies. In this Viewpoint, we reflect upon the 'Clinical Memorandum on Psychedelics' recently released by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and note subsequent developments including the application for down-scheduling of psilocybin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine presently being considered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and approvals for access via the Special Access Scheme. We suggest that this field is worthy of rigorous research to assess potential benefits, address safety parameters and clarify therapeutic mechanisms. To this end, we outline recent research findings, provide an overview of current knowledge relating to mechanisms of action and discuss salient aspects of the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy treatment model. The sum of this research points towards medicinal psychedelics as a potential new class of psychiatric treatments when used within a medically supervised framework with integrated psychotherapeutic support. However, before widespread translation into clinical use can occur, appropriately designed and sufficiently powered trials are required to detect both potential positive and negative outcomes. Unique safety and regulatory challenges also need to be addressed. As for any new medical therapy, psychedelic research needs to be conducted in a rigorous manner, through the dispassionate lens of scientific enquiry. Carte blanche availability to practitioners, without specific protocols and appropriate training, would be potentially harmful to individuals and detrimental to the field."
"2800","1","Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^
Objectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados."
"8180","1","Relationship of ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects in unipolar depression.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine and other NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists produce fast-acting antidepressant-like effects, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, two weeks clinical trial we studied the effects of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) in a group of 27 hospitalized depressive patients. RESULTS: Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen´s d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor-ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. CONCLUSION: The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. This relationship could be mediated by the initial steps of ketamine's action, trough NMDA receptors, shared by both ketamine's clinical effects."
"7744","1","Effects of methylphenidate and MDMA (ecstasy) on appraisal of erotic stimuli.^
Background: Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it is also increasingly misused recreationally and as cognitive enhancer (neuroenhancer). 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') is a popular recreational club drug mainly used due to its entactogenic properties, i.e. the drug is thought to enhance feelings of sociability, empathy, and closeness to others. Methylphenidate mainly enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas MDMA mainly increases brain serotonin levels. Additionally, both drugs increase noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore have also psychostimulant properties. It is well recognized that psychoactive substances affect sexual perception and behavior. Typically, dopaminergic psychostimulants including methamphetamine and cocaine are reported to enhance sexual drive and to increase sexual pleasure. In contrast, serotonergic drugs such as serotonin uptake inhibitors typically impair sexual arousal and functions (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty reaching orgasm). However, ecstasy users describe inconsistent effects on sexual desire and performance. Some users report feelings of emotional closeness while consuming Ecstasy but no desire for penetrative sex. Others report that ecstasy increased their sexual arousal and some use it specifically for sexual enhancement. It seems that MDMA induces well‐being and feelings of closeness to others accompanied by a sensual rather than a sexual enhancement. However, research on psychoactive drug use and sexual behavior is typically based on interviews of drug users and has mainly focused on sexual risk taking. It remains to be determined, whether methylphenidate and MDMA alter sexual arousal when measured objectively in a laboratory setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli after administration of single doses of methylphenidate, MDMA, or placebo. Methods: We evaluated effects of methylphenidate (40 mg), MDMA (75 mg) and placebo on subjective sexual arousal by viewing erotic pictures using a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled cross‐over design in 30 healthy subjects (15 men, 15 women). In the Sexual Arousal Task (SAT), participants had to evaluate 16 neutral, erotic (implicit sexual), or sexual (explicit sexual) color photographs taken from the International Affective Picture System and to rate how pleasant, exciting/arousing, attractive, likable or erotic they considered these pictures. Results: Methylphenidate significantly increased ratings of arousal compared with both placebo (p<0.01) and MDMA (p<0.001), but only for pictures with an explicit sexual content. Methylphenidate similarly tended to increase ratings of erotic compared with placebo (p<0.05) and MDMA (p<0.05) for pictures with explicit sexual content. MDMA did not alter ratings on any of the dimensions regardless of sexual content. There were no significant differences between male or female participants in any of the ratings or drug effects. Conclusion: Methylphenidate increased ratings of sexual excitation by visual stimuli with explicit sexual content. In contrast, MDMA had no such effects on sexual arousal. The findings indicate that pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic (methylphenidate) but not of serotonergic (MDMA) neurotransmission enhances sexual drive. It needs to be investigated whether sexual perception or even risk‐associated sexual behavior is altered in subjects using methylphenidate for cognitive enhancement or as treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."
"4927","0","Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis of presentations to an urban emergency department in Switzerland.^
Background Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy). Aims of the study To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence. Methods Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded. Results The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic. Conclusion Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances."
"123","0","Depression and suicide (Hungarian).^
Every form of depression involves a risk of suicide. It is particularly great in the phase of activation, but it is present in every phase of the disease. Short term but intensive psychotherapy was shown to be very beneficial in bringing the patients out of the phase of crisis. In cases of this nature the main consideration is that of gaining time. As a supplementary measure an appropriately selected course of suitable drugs is always indicated. The patient should be helped out of his constrictive mental state which is the principal symptom of depression and the presuicidal syndrome. Initial response should not deceive the therapist, since the risk of suicide still persists in a latent form. Causes which can influence the background of every depression, such as unfavourable external circumstances and severe physical illness should naturally also receive attention, in order to secure a lasting psychotherapeutic result. The numerous failures should not deter the efforts made in this respect."
"558","1","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^
OBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted."
"4344","0","Evidence of 2 populations of mephedrone abusers by hair testing. Application to 4 forensic expertises.^
Background: New psychoactive substances are conquering the drug scene. Among these substances, cathinone derivatives have been observed since late in the years 2000. At that time, there was evidence of increasing use of the synthetic cathinone mephedrone, particularly amongst clubbers. Although the emergent drugs have an aura of safety, there is an increasing amount of experiences on their secondary effects. Mephedrone is known to induce psychosis. Method: Given the potential negative effects of mephedrone, the laboratory was asked to test for the drug in hair, a cumulative matrix that can document single, occasional or repetitive abuse of xenobiotics. Mephedrone was tested in hair by GC/MS, using a standard procedure developed for stimulants such as amphetamine or ecstasy. Results: In the head hair of 24 positive abusers, mephedrone was identified in the range 0.1 to 87 ng/mg, clearly determining 2 populations, one with co-administration of ecstasy and a second without ecstasy. In the first population, mephedrone concentrations were 0.1 to 5 ng/mg; in the second population, mephedrone concentrations were 3 to 87 ng/mg. These findings should help in the understanding the addiction of subjects. In 4 separate forensic cases, mephedrone was identified in hair of abusers, including a rape case (0.54 ng/mg), a fatal car crash (0.38 ng/mg), a fatal drowning (1.21 ng/mg), and a fatal overdose (6.99 ng/mg). Conclusion: Hair testing for new psychoactive substances appears as a good complement to standard urine analyses. This study confirms the increasing diffusion of new drugs among the forensic population of abusers."
"6660","0","An in vivo microdialysis assessment of concurrent MDMA and cocaine administration in Sprague-Dawley rats.^
Despite the popularity of polysubstance abuse among recreational methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users, relatively few controlled experimental studies have documented the neurobehavioral effects of MDMA in combination with other abused substances. In this study, the combined acute effects of MDMA and cocaine were examined by conducting in vivo microdialysis in the rat nucleus accumbens while simultaneously monitoring locomotor activity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered cocaine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.), MDMA (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), or one of four combinations of cocaine and MDMA during microdialysis experiments. Locomotor activity was monitored, and dialysis samples were collected every 30 min for 3 h prior to injections, for one 30-min period following saline injections, and for an additional 3-h period following drug injections. Samples were analyzed for dopamine content by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Significant differences in locomotor activity and dopamine efflux were found among treatment groups, with some MDMA/cocaine combinations producing significantly greater increases compared to single doses of cocaine or MDMA within the first 30 min after injection. Considering the popularity of polysubstance use among recreational MDMA users, the clinical implications of the current findings warrant further investigation."

"5675","0","Everolimus induced mood changes in breast cancer patients: a case-control study.^
Introduction The PI3K/Akt/mTOR pathway plays a critical role in cancer cell growth, proliferation and angiogenesis, but also in brain homeostasis and the pathophysiology of mood disorders. The impact of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus on the mood of breast cancer patients is unknown. Materials and methods Consecutive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy +/- everolimus were prospectively followed-up using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) questionnaires. Results Post hoc tests comparing everolimus + hormonotherapy to hormonotherapy alone demonstrated a significant effect of everolimus after 6 weeks of treatment on BDI scores (t(1,38) = -2.0716, p < 0.05), and after 3 weeks (t(1,38) = -3.9165, p < 0.001) and 6 weeks of treatment (t(1,38) = -2.0373, p < 0.05) on MADRS scores. Analysis within each treatment group showed that the effect of time since treatment initiation on BDI and MADRS scores was specifically observed in the everolimus + hormonotherapy group (F(2,34) = 11.875, p < 0.001 and F(2,34) = 7.820, p < 0.01 respectively), but not in the hormonotherapy alone group (F(2.34) = 1.671, p > 0.2 and F(2,34) = 0.830, p > 0.2 respectively). Conclusions The mTOR inhibitor everolimus induces significant mood alterations in breast cancer patients. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms is not only mandatory in the context of phase 1, dose-finding studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, but is also clinically relevant in daily practice."
"9446","1","Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6."
"7822","1","A proof-of-principle study of the short-term effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on tinnitus and neural connectivity.^
Background: This study was conducted to investigate the short-term behavioural and neurophysiological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on tinnitus perception.Methods: A double-blind randomized controlled cross-over design. Part 1. Behavioural measures of tinnitus following 30 mg MDMA or placebo administration (N = 5 participants) and Part 2. Behavioural measures of tinnitus and correlations between pairs of apriori regions of interest (ROI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after 70 mg of MDMA or placebo (N = 8 participants).Results: The results to MDMA were similar to placebo. For the 70 mg dose, there was a significant reduction after 4 h in annoyance and ignore ratings. RsMRI showed decreased connectivity compared with placebo administration between the left hippocampal, right hippocampal, left amygdala and right amygdala regions, and between the right posterior parahippocampal cortex and the left amygdala after two hours of 70 mg MDMA administration. Increased connectivity compared to placebo administration was found post MDMA between the right post-central gyrus and right posterior and superior temporal gyrus, and between the thalamus and frontoparietal network.Conclusions: Following 70 mg of MDMA two tinnitus rating scales significantly improved. There was, however, a placebo effect. Compared with placebo the rsMRI following the MDMA showed reductions in connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. There is sufficient proof of concept to support future investigation of MDMA as a treatment for tinnitus."

Preclinical studies implicate a role for α₁-noradrenergic receptors in the effects of psychostimulants, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). The present study evaluated the effects of the α₁-noradrenergic receptor antagonist doxazosin on the acute pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic response to MDMA in 16 healthy subjects. Doxazosin (8 mg/d) or placebo was administered for 3 days before MDMA (125 mg) or placebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-session, crossover design. Doxazosin reduced MDMA-induced elevations in blood pressure, body temperature, and moderately attenuated positive mood but enhanced tachycardia associated with MDMA. The results indicate that α₁-adrenergic receptors contribute to the acute cardiostimulant and to a minor extent possibly also to the thermogenic and euphoric effects of MDMA in humans."

In order to clarify the mechanism of drug incorporation into hair, disposition of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA) and metabolites of MDMA, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMAP) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), into hair was investigated with an animal model. After the intraperitoneal administration of those six drugs to pigmented hairy rats (5 mg/kg/day, 10 days, n = 3), the parent compounds and their metabolites in the rat plasma (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 360 min after administration) and in the newly grown rat hair for 4 weeks were determined by GC/MS-SIM. When the ratio of hair concentration to area under the concentration versus time curves (AUCs) in plasma was represented as an index of incorporation rate (ICR) of drugs into hair, the order of ICRs was HMAP < MDA < HMMA < MDMA < MDEA < MMDA. In the comparison between MDA, MDMA and MDEA, their ICRs increased according to the length of carbon branches from proton to ethyl at the N position. From the point of view that the ICRs of MMDA was 2.3 times as much as that of MDA, the methoxy group on the benzene ring seemed to serve as a positive factor for the ICR. However, the ICRs of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy compounds, HMAP and HMMA, were lower in comparison with those of MDA and MDMA, respectively. On the other hand, the ICRs of MDA, MDMA and MDEA were 5.5-6.1 times larger than those of amphetamine, methamphetamine and ethylamphetamine, suggesting that the methylenedioxy group on the benzene ring raises their ICRs very positively. Moreover, in order to apply the results from the animal experiments to human cases, the scalp hair samples of seven MDMA abusers were analyzed. MDMA and its metabolites, MDA, were simultaneously detected in all the samples by GC/MS. In the two samples, MDEA was found in addition to MDMA and MDA. It was shown that a hair sample is a good specimen for the confirmation of retrospective use of methylenedioxyamphetamines."
"1769","0","Preliminary evidence of cannabinoid effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Acute and chronic exposure to cannabinoids has been associated with cognitive deficits, a higher risk for schizophrenia and other drug abuse. However, the precise mechanism underlying such effects is not known. Preclinical studies suggest that cannabinoids modulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Accordingly, we hypothesized that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the principal active component of cannabis, would alter BDNF levels in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy control subjects (n = 14) and light users of cannabis (n = 9) received intravenous administration of (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta(9)-THC in a double-blind, fixed order, placebo-controlled, laboratory study. Serum sampled at baseline, after placebo administration, and after Delta(9)-THC administration was assayed for BDNF using ELISA. RESULTS: Delta(9)-THC increased serum BDNF levels in healthy controls but not light users of cannabis. Further, light users of cannabis had lower basal BDNF levels. Delta(9)-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and ""high"" and spatial memory impairments. IMPLICATIONS: The effects of socially relevant doses of cannabinoids on BDNF suggest a possible mechanism underlying the consequences of exposure to cannabis. This may be of particular importance for the developing brain and also in disorders believed to involve altered neurodevelopment such as schizophrenia. Larger studies to investigate the effects of cannabinoids on BDNF and other neurotrophins are warranted."

Sixty patients of both sexes were given Butryptiline in order to study its antidepressive and anxiolytic action. They were all suffering from diverse types of depression with accompanying anxiety. Dosages ranged from 75 to 250 mg daily. The study lasted for 16 weeks as evolution was followed by daily interviews. Anxiolytic effects were noted in the first few days; antidepressive effects appeared after 2 to 3 weeks. This motivated the use of high doses in suicidal cases, which resulted in confusional states. Excellent results were observed in 30 cases, improvement in 14, no change in 11 and worsening in 5. Most frequent side effects were a fine tremor of the extremities, dry mouth and blurred vision."
"3449","1","Neurocognitive and behavioural performance of healthy volunteers receiving an increasing analgesic-range infusion of ketamine.^
Background: The acute and delayed effect of analgesic-range doses of ketamine on neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes is understudied. Using a non-controlled open-labelled design, three (1-h duration) increasing intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions comprising (i) 30 mg bolus of ketamine + 8 mg/h IV infusion, (ii) 12 mg/h IV infusion and (iii) 20 mg/h infusion were administered to 20 participants (15 male, 5 female, mean age = 30.8 years). Whole-blood ketamine and norketamine concentrations were determined at each treatment step and post-infusion. Methods: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was used to assess reaction/movement time (RTI, Simple and 5-Choice), visuospatial working memory (SWM), spatial planning (SOC) and subjective effects (visual analogue scale; VAS) during treatment and at post-treatment. Results: Significant main effects were reported for time (dose) on CANTAB RTI 5-Choice reaction (F(4,18) = 3.41, p = 0.029) and movement time (F(4,18) = 4.42, p = 0.011), SWM (F(4,18) = 4.19, p = 0.014) and SOC (F(4,18) = 4.13, p = 0.015), but not RTI Simple reaction or movement time. Post hoc analyses revealed dose-dependent effects for both RTI 5-Choice reaction and movement time (all p < 0.05). Post-treatment performance on all neurocognitive and behavioural tasks returned to baseline levels. Regression analyses revealed a weak positive linear association between SWM ‘strategy’ score (R² = 0.103, p < 0.001), all performance-based CANTAB VAS items (R² range 0.005–0.137, all p < 0.05) and ketamine blood concentrations. Discussion: The open-label, non-controlled trial design somewhat precludes the ability to adequately account for random treatment effects. Notwithstanding, these results suggest that analgesic doses of ketamine produce acute, selective, dose-dependent deficits in higher-order neurocognitive and behavioural domains.

Clinical studies provide evidence that ketamine and psilocybin could be used as fast-acting antidepressants, though their mechanisms and toxicity are still not fully understood. To address this issue, we have examined the effect of a single administration of ketamine and psilocybin on the extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in the rat frontal cortex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus using microdialysis. The genotoxic effect and density of glutamate receptor proteins was measured with comet assay and Western blot, respectively. An open field test, light-dark box test and forced swim test were conducted to examine rat behavior 24 h after drug administration. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) and psilocybin (2 and 10 mg/kg) increased dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA extracellular levels in the frontal cortex, while psilocybin also increased GABA in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Oxidative DNA damage due to psilocybin was observed in the frontal cortex and from both drugs in the hippocampus. NR2A subunit levels were increased after psilocybin (10 mg/kg). Behavioral tests showed no antidepressant or anxiolytic effects, and only ketamine suppressed rat locomotor activity. The observed changes in neurotransmission might lead to genotoxicity and increased NR2A levels, while not markedly affecting animal behavior."

They are defined as agents causing alterations in perception, cognition and mood in the presence of otherwise clear sensorium. Research on such drugs focuses on study groups, post hoc analyses, epidemiological studies and case reports. Drugs like cocaine, marijuana and LSD are commonly abused, but studies show that LSD can be used as a therapeutic agent. Psychotic reactions and perceptual disturbances due to HLDs are discussed. Essential criteria for evaluating HLD medication in psychotherapy include specific diagnosis, severity measures, informed consent and placebo controls.

Poor inhibitory control and heightened sensitivity to drug reward are two well-established risk factors for substance use disorders. Although these risk factors have traditionally been studied independently, there is reason to expect they may be related at the neurobiological level. Here, translational studies investigating the association between poor inhibition and greater drug reward sensitivity in both laboratory animals and humans are reviewed. Findings show that in animals, inhibitory deficits are associated with greater self-administration of cocaine, nicotine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), and alcohol, but not heroin. Likewise, in healthy human volunteers, poor inhibitory control and less brain engagement in right frontal regions during inhibition are associated with greater and more positive subjective responses to amphetamine and alcohol. The potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association are discussed, including the number or function of striatal dopamine D₂ receptors, as well as the implications of the findings and directions for future research.

"900","1","Slouching towards engagement: interactions between people using psychedelics naturalistically and their healthcare providers.^
Introduction: There is substantial public interest in psychedelics as potential treatments for psychiatric conditions. However, most psychedelics are criminalized under federal law in the USA, so it is unclear whether use occurs with clinical support. Our objective was to assess whether naturalistic psychedelic use occurs with clinical support, interactions between those using psychedelics and healthcare providers (psychiatrist, therapist, or primary physicians), and use characteristics. Methods: We conducted an online, anonymous, confidential, cross-sectional survey of adults reporting psychedelic use (N = 1221) through a psychedelics advocacy event and social media between 9/18/2022 and 11/5/2022. We assessed participant disclosure of psychedelic use with their psychiatric care provider (PsyCP) and/or primary care provider (PCP), desire for provider support, access to support, and rate of taking prescribed psychoactive medications alongside psychedelics. Results: Among participants with such care providers, 22% disclosed psychedelic use to their PCP vs. 58% to their PsyCP. Participants were less confident in PCP vs. PsyCP ability to integrate psychedelics into treatment. Common reasons for nondisclosure included stigma, inadequate provider knowledge, and legal concerns. 23% reported taking psychedelics on the same day as potentially interacting psychiatric medications (e.g., anxiolytics, antidepressants). Despite 81% of participants desiring therapist support during psychedelic experiences, only 15% had received such support. Discussion: Our results show that psychedelic use is generally disconnected from primary and psychiatric clinical care. This disconnection may result in safety issues, including inadequate screening for contraindicated conditions, lack of support during emergent adverse events, and drug interactions. Enhanced clinical education and orienting drug policy towards known harms and benefits of psychedelics is needed."
"6168","1","Effects of MDMA-like Substances in Healthy Subjects.^
3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used as recreational substance (Ecstasy), research tool to stimulate serotonin (5‐HT) and oxytocin release and study associated mood states, and as a potential therapeutic substance to enhance psychotherapy for post‐traumatic stress disorder. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative which, unlike prototypical amphetamines, predominantly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission via release of 5‐HT through the SERT and it less potently also releases dopamine and norepinephrine through the DA transporter and NE transporter, respectively. Furthermore, MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which may contribute to its effects to increase trust, prosociality, and enhance empathy. MDMA is therefore referred to as an ""entactogen"" or ""empathogen"". MDMA is currently the only empathogen investigated in substance‐assisted psychotherapy but other substances including the MDMA‐metabolite 3,4‐methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) have been used in the past or may be used in the future. Aim 1: MDA may exert greater perceptual psychedelic‐like effects due to a more potent binding to the serotonin 5‐HT2A receptor, and it may also act longer than MDMA partly due to a longer plasma half‐life. However, effects of MDMA and MDA have never been compared directly in the same study in humans and there is only one modern study that characterized MDA in humans. Therefore, the present study aims to describe and directly compare for the first time the effects of MDMA and MDA in the same healthy volunteers using modern and sensitive psychological and psychometric tests. Aim 2: Additionally, although amphetamines including MDMA and MDA induce mainly positive subjective effects they may also produce negative subjective drug effects including anxiety in particular at the onset of the subjective response and the rapid onset of euphoria may increase abuse liability. Additionally, blood pressure may increase rapidly at drug onset. A possible solution to mitigate anxiety, abuse‐related rapid euphoria increases and/or rapid blood pressure changes at onset consist of slowing the onset of the drug effect by using a slow‐release formulation of MDMA/MDA. Alternatively, amphetamines can be linked to the endogenous amino acid lysine forming inactive lysine‐amphetamine which then liberates the active amphetamine slowly in the circulation via plasma peptidases. This approach has been implemented with the medication Lisdexamfetamine, which combines lysine with d‐amphetamine. In the present study, the investigators will similarly characterize the effects of lysine‐MDMA and lysine‐MDA to test for attenuated effects across both substances in comparison with MDMA/MDA. Using a two‐factorial study design with four active substance conditions (MDMA vs. MDA and lysine‐MDMA vs. lysine‐MDA) the investigators will be able to test differences between MDMA and MDA (with and without lysine) as well as between lysinated a non‐lysinated substance (regardless of active substance) in the same study and with high statistical power and within one study addressing two aims."
"7057","1","The role of the serotonin 2A receptor in the fabric and modulation of personal meaning in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced states.^
Abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to stimuli are critical features of many psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, and mood disorders [1]. However, the neuronal substrates enabling meaningful and personally relevant experiences are largely unknown. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical hallucinogen which has high affinity at serotonin (5‐HT)‐2A/C, ‐1A/B, ‐6, and ‐7, and dopamine D2/D1 receptors (R). Animal studies suggest that LSD produces its psychedelic effects primarily via agonist action at 5‐HT2AR although D2R may also be implicated. A core feature of LSDinduced psychedelic states is an increased sense of meaning of objects [2]. Ketanserin is a selective 5‐HT2AR antagonist which may in combination with LSD and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer the opportunity to determine the role of the 5‐HT2AR system in personal meaning processing. In a double‐blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross‐over study we therefore assessed the neural and behavioral response to personally meaningful, neutral, and personally meaningless music using fMRI and behavioral meaningfulness ratings. Twenty‐two healthy participants received either (1) placebo + placebo (Pla condition), (2) placebo + LSD (100 μg po, LSD condition), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg po) + LSD (100 μg po, Ket+LSD condition) at three different occasions. Subjective drug effects were assessed using the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). Behavioral data were analyzed by repeated‐measures analyses of variance with treatment (Pla, LSD, Ket+LSD) and scale (5D‐ASC scales) or music category (meaningful, neutral, meaningless) as within‐subject factors followed by Bonforroni‐corrected simple main effects analyses or paired comparisons in case of significant interactions or main effects. FMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM12. Meaningfulness ratings were increased for meaningless and neutral music under LSD compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD (all p<0.05). Furthermore, listening to meaningless music compared to neutral and personally meaningful music was associated with increased BOLD signal in medial and lateral frontal brain areas in the LSD condition compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD conditions. (brain areas: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, all p<0.05, FWE corrected). Furthermore, subjective drug effects were significantly increased after LSD administration compared to placebo on all 5D‐ASC scales (all p<0.05) except for anxiety and spiritual experience (all p>0.30). These LSDinduced effects were fully blocked by ketanserin (all p <0.05). LSD increased the attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli. This effect appears to be attributable to 5‐HT2AR stimulation, since these alterations are normalized after pretreatment with ketanserin. Furthermore, surprisingly virtually all LSD‐induced psychological effects were blocked by 5‐HT2AR antagonism, despite LSD's additional action on dopamine receptors. The current results emphasize the pivotal role of the 5‐HT2AR in the generation of personal meaning in medial and lateral frontal brains structures implicated in self‐referential processes [3]. These findings may be relevant for increasing our understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of personal meaning processing and may reveal prospective targets in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in meaning attribution."
"6215","0","Comparision of Motor Seizure Duration of Ketofol and Propofol for Electroconvulsive Therapy.^
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a common treatment method used in severe depression and other psychiatric diseases. Currently, most ECT procedures are carried out with muscle paralysis under general anesthesia. It is important to establish an accurate balance between adequate anesthesia depth and optimal seizure duration. The objective of anesthesia during ECT is to provide a rapid onset and balance of both unconsciousness and muscle relaxation for the duration of the electrical stimulus and subsequent seizure .Therefore, anesthetics that are used for general anesthesia during ECT should have rapid onset, rapid emergence, no interference with seizure activity and longer seizure duration. A motor seizure lasting 20‐25 seconds at minimum has been typically recommended for therapeutic efficacy of ECT . Common drugs used for ECT anesthesia are methohexital, thiopental, etomidate, propofol and ketamine. Methohexital exerts depressant action on seizure activity and is contraindicated in patients acute intermittent porphyria. Etomidate causes increased incidence of emesis. Similarly incidence of sinus bradycardia and premature ventricular contraction increased with the use of thiopental during ECT procedures . For these reasons methohexital, thiopental and etomidate are not used in current anesthetic practice for electroconvulsive therapy Propofol as an anaesthetic in ECT has favorable characteristics such as rapid onset and emergence from anesthesia, minimal postoperative confusion and a lower incidence of hypertension or tachycardia during induction of anesthesia. However, it produces a dose‐ dependent decrease in seizure duration . Ketamine, is also used as an anesthetic agent in ECT because it has a favorable seizure inducing effect and increased seizure duration. But it is also not devoid of disadvantages. Its main disadvantages are that it produces hypertension, delayed recovery and precipitates psychomimetic emergence phenomena . So ketofol (1:1combination of ketamine and propofol) can be a good alternative to either propofol or ketamine used alone for anesthetic management for ECT. Ketamine mitigates propofol‐induced hypotension, and propofol mitigates ketamine‐induced vomiting and emergence agitation. Ketofol can also have better outcome on motor seizure duration than propofol alone. Therefore, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that ketofol would be a good alternative anesthetic agent and better than propofol for ECT procedures.After obtaining approval from Institutional Review committee (IRC) of TUTH and Nepal health research council (NHRC) the process of enrolling the eligible patients into the study will be started. Patients will be assessed for eligibility. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not having the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be divided into two groups: Group P (propofol group,n=27) and Group K (ketofol group ,n=27) using computer generated random numbers. Blinding will be done by sealed envelope technique. Pre‐anesthetic checkup will be conducted and a detailed history and complete physical examination will be done prior to procedure. Informed consent will be taken from the legal guardian of patient. Patient will be transferred to the pre anesthetic room. Baseline hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, SPO2 and HR) will be taken and recorded. An 18 G IV cannula will be secured in appropriate hand of patient. Patient will be premedicated with glycopyrolate 0.2 mg 30 minutes prior to procedure. Patient will be transferred to operation theatre. III ECG leads, SPO2 probe and NIBP pressure cuff will be attached. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be continually monitored. Preoxygenation will be done via facemask at the rate of 5liter/min for 5 minutes. Anesthesia assistant will pick an envelope for each patient. Test solution will be prepared by anesthesia assistant as per the instructions in the envelope. Group K ‐ In 1 ml syringe, 2ml of ketamine (50mg/ml solution) and 8ml of normal saline will be drawn to make the 10mg/ml solution of ketamine. Finally in another new 10 ml syringe 5ml of the freshly prepared solution of ketamine (10mg/ml) and 5ml of propofol (10mg/ml) will be mixed. The study drug thus prepared will contain 5mg /ml of propofol and 5mg / ml of ketamine. There will be two such 10ml syringe of ketofol. Group P ‐ propofol (10mg/ml solution) will be drawn in labeled 10ml syringe. Two such 10ml syringes of propofol will be prepared. Patient in Group K will be administered an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg ketofol (0.25 mg/kg of propofol + 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine). Similarly, patient in Group P will be given an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg propofol. In both the group this initial dose will be given within 15 seconds. Five seconds after administration of drug, patient will be assessed for unresponsiveness to verbal commands (by calling patient's name) & loss of eyelash reflex. Then titrated dose of drug will be given at the rate of 1ml every 5 seconds until the patient no longer responds to verbal commands and there is loss of eyelash reflex. The required total dose of propofol or ketofol will be recorded. After loss of consciousness, hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, HR & SPO2) will be taken and recorded. An isolated forearm technique will be performed by inflating the tourniquet in arm where the iv cannula is not placed. Then, succinylcholine, 1 mg/kg iv will be administered. Ventilation will be assisted with 100 % oxygen via face mask in all groups during the procedure. Bite block will be used prior to application of bifrontal electrodes. Then a psychiatrist blinded to the study groups will administer electrical stimuli through bifrontal electrodes. The frequency will be set at 90Hz and current will be set at 800 milliampere. The duration of the motor seizure will be defined as the time from the ECT stimulus to cessation of tonic‐clonic motor activity in the 'isolated' arm. After the end of seizure, bite block will be removed and ventilation will be continued with 100% oxygen via face mask. The duration of motor seizures will be recorded. Hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP and HR) will be recorded 1mins and 5 mins after the end of seizure. Common complication encountered during ECT are transient hypertension and tachycardia. Esmolol 5mg iv bolus will be given during such episodes. The time from the end of succinylcholine administration until spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and obeying commands will be recorded. Once the patient is awake, obeys commands and maintains oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen, the patient will be transferred to postoperative room. Patient will be monitored with ECG, pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure for one hour in postoperative room and then the patient will be transferred."

The objectives of this double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study are to test the hypotheses that a single high (25 mg) oral dose of psilocybin will lead to enduring reductions in depressive symptoms (as measured by the clinician‐rated grid version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, or GRID‐HAMD) and amount of drinking (as measured using the Time Line Follow Back, or TLFB, procedure) compared to placebo in patients with co‐occurring MDD and AUD. 90 male and female volunteers who are between the ages of 21 and 65 years old and who meet Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, Fifth Edition (DSM‐5) criteria for MDD and AUD will be recruited from the community and complete all study procedures. Volunteers will be randomized to one of two study arms (psilocybin [N=45] or placebo [N=45]), and will complete a drug administration session paired with a brief Motivational Interviewing intervention for alcohol use. Volunteers will undergo assessments of depression and alcohol use before and after treatment. After primary endpoints are measured, all volunteers will receive a second, unblinded intervention with a single high dose of psilocybin (25 mg) to test a secondary hypothesis that two doses of psilocybin are more effective in treating MDD with co‐occurring AUD than a single dose."

Comments on an article by M. Ranganathan et al. (see record [rid]2012-19607-001[/rid]). In their study, Ranganathan et al. explored the psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, neuroendocrine effects, and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) effects resulting from the controlled administration of Salvinorin A (SA) to humans. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the effects of SA in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, counterbalanced study in healthy humans. To perform this study, Ranganathan et al. recruited 10 psychiatrically and medically healthy subjects who had previous experience with SA and, in some cases, other psychoactive medications. Consistent with anecdotal reports, the subjects experienced a rapid, short-lasting, and intense psychoactive effect of SA. To gain a better understanding of the endocrine effects of SA, the authors measured the cortisol and prolactin serum levels after SA administration. Resting EEG power is sensitive to drug-induced changes in consciousness and may be altered in psychosis. The authors reported that both doses of SA decreased resting-state EEG spectral power compared with the placebo. The authors did not comment on any sex differences in SA effects. The authors noted that the effects of SA make it unlikely to cause addiction, which is likely a result of KOR agonists’ aversive effects. Most importantly, this study extends our knowledge of drug-induced psychotomimesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5735","1","The effects of repeated low doses of LSD in healthy human volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: There have been frequent reports of the use of psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at very low doses, known as 'microdosing'. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing improves cognitive functioning and mood. However, few controlled studies have examined the effects of exposure to repeated microdoses in humans. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of repeated low doses of LSD on mood, cognition, and subjective experiences in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 received four sublingual doses of placebo (n = 18), 13 μg (n = 19), or 26 μg (n = 19) of LSD administered every 3 to 4 days. Physiological, subjective, mood, and cognitive outcome measures were collected over five in‐laboratory sessions. Acute effects were examined during the first and fourth drug administration sessions, and lasting effects of LSD were examined during the fifth drug‐free session. RESULTS: Over the four drug administration sessions, repeated microdoses of LSD elicited dose‐dependent subjective “drug feel” effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05) and stimulant‐like effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05). LSD also acutely decreased negative mood during a simulated social rejection task (26 μg vs placebo, P < 0.05). Overall, the drug produced minimal effects on physiological, cognitive, and most other mood‐related measures. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to low doses of LSD have minimal effects on overall mood and cognitive performance in healthy adults. Future studies with symptomatic volunteers or different doses may be needed to investigate the claims of microdose users."

The classical psychedelic psilocybin is of interest as a treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study investigated the effects of psilocybin on voluntary ethanol consumption in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice administered saline or psilocybin intraperitoneally as a single dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg and provided 20% ethanol utilizing a two-bottle choice alcohol drinking paradigm. Ethanol was provided continuously for 3 days immediately following the administration of psilocybin, then withheld for 2 days, and then provided continuously for two subsequent additional days. A multilevel model (MLM) for repeated measures was used to compare ethanol consumption and preference in psilocybin-treated groups versus controls. Ethanol consumption and preference were reduced in male mice during the 3-day interval that immediately followed psilocybin administration. The effect of psilocybin on ethanol consumption was dose-related and was consistent across the 3-day interval at dosages of 0.5 mg/kg or greater. Psilocybin had no effect on consumption or preference when ethanol was subsequently reintroduced after 2 days of withdrawal. In contrast to males, psilocybin had no significant effect on ethanol consumption or preference in female mice at any dosage or time point. The lack of an effect of psilocybin on quinine preference, and its limited interaction with locomotor activity indicated that the observed reduction in voluntary ethanol consumption was not attributable to altered taste perception or motor effects. Total fluid consumption was increased in males at some time points and psilocybin dosages and unchanged in females, and the absence of any decrease in either group at any time point indicated that the observed reduction in ethanol consumption was not mediated by nonspecific effects on consummatory behavior. The finding of a sex-dependent effect of psilocybin on ethanol consumption suggests that the C57BL/6J mouse may provide a useful experimental approach to modeling sex differences in vulnerability to AUD in addition to investigation of the neurobiological basis of the effect of classical psychedelics on alcohol drinking behavior."

Objectives: Depersonalization disorder (DPD) is a chronic condition characterized by the persistent subjective experience of unreality and detachment from the self. To date, there is no known treatment. Lamotrigine as sole agent was not found to be effective in a previous small double-blind, randomized crossover trial. However, evidence from open trials suggests that it may be beneficial as an add-on medication with antidepressants. Methods: We report here an extended series of 32 patients with DPD in whom lamotrigine was prescribed as an augmenting medication. Most of the patients were receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Results: Fifty-six percent (n = 18) of patients had a more than or equal to 30% reduction on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale score at follow-up. Both maximum dose of lamotrigine used and before treatment Cambridge Depersonalization Scale scores showed positive correlations with the percentage of response. Conclusions: The results of this trial suggest that a significant number of patients with DPD may respond to lamotrigine when combined with antidepressant medication. The results are sufficiently positive to prompt a larger controlled evaluation of lamotrigine as ""add-on' treatment in DPD."
"1139","1","Ketamine-induced changes in resting state connectivity, 2 h after the drug administration in patients with remitted depression.^
BACKGROUND: Resting state connectivity studies link ketamine's antidepressant effects with normalisation of the brain connectivity changes that are observed in depression. These changes, however, usually co-occur with improvement in depressive symptoms, making it difficult to attribute these changes to ketamine's effects per se. AIMS: Our aim is to examine the effects of ketamine in brain connectivity, 2 h after its administration in a cohort of volunteers with remitted depression. Any significant changes observed in this study could provide insight of ketamine's antidepressant mechanism as they are not accompanied by symptom changes. METHODS: In total, 35 participants with remitted depression (21 females, mean age = 28.5 years) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. Resting state scans were acquired approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion. Brain connectivity was examined using a seed-based approach (ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)) and a brain network analysis (independent component analysis). RESULTS: Decreased connectivity between the sgACC and the amygdala was observed approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion, compared to placebo (p(FWE) < 0.05). The executive network presented with altered connectivity with different cortical and subcortical regions. Within the network, the left hippocampus and right amygdala had decreased connectivity (p(FWE) < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a model whereby ketamine would change the connectivity of brain areas and networks that are important for cognitive processing and emotional regulation. These changes could also be an indirect indicator of the plasticity changes induced by the drug."

Methylphenidate and modafinil are increasingly used as performance enhancers or ""smart drugs"" by students. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") is widely used as recreational drug to enhance emotions. We plan to investigate effects of these psychostimulants on emotion‐processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a placebo‐controlled, randomized cross‐over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain‐induced changes in brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs. This information will improve our understanding of the neurofunctional effects of methylphenidate, modafinil, and MDMA, and inform the ongoing debate surrounding brain doping with cognitive and mood enhancers."
"8868","1","At ease-subjective effects of MDMA in placebo-controlled studies with healthy subjects.^
Background: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ?ecstasy?) is widely used recreationally. However, MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder. This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. Methods: The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects (82 females) receiving a single dose of 125 mg of MDMA. Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D‐ASC) administered once after the drug effect, and a series of visual analogue scales (VASs) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve (AUEC0‐6h). Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo (Δ). Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration. Results: MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC. However, the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small (Δ5D‐ASC total score, % mean±SD] 13±11; p<.001) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity (Δrating score, %mean±SD: 37±32 and 21±26, respectively; both p<.001). MDMA acutely enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, talkative, trust, and closeness to others on the VASs (ΔAUEC0‐6h, %mean±SD: 95±136, 48±151, 118±135, and 71±123, respectively; all p<.001). Talkative ratings were more pronounced in men than women (ΔAUEC0‐6h, %mean±SD: 63±117 vs 34±178, respectively; p=.04). Conclusions: At a dose of 125 mg, MDMA displays strong empathogenic effects that may be beneficial for the therapeutic success of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy."
"2205","1","The Effects of Daytime Psilocybin Administration on Sleep: Implications for Antidepressant Action.^
Serotonergic agonist psilocybin is a psychedelic with antidepressant potential. Sleep may interact with psilocybin's antidepressant properties like other antidepressant drugs via induction of neuroplasticity. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of psilocybin on sleep architecture on the night after psilocybin administration. Regarding the potential antidepressant properties, we hypothesized that psilocybin, similar to other classical antidepressants, would reduce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and prolong REM sleep latency. Moreover, we also hypothesized that psilocybin would promote slow-wave activity (SWA) expression in the first sleep cycle, a marker of sleep-related neuroplasticity. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, age 28-53) underwent two drug administration sessions, psilocybin or placebo, in a randomized, double-blinded design. Changes in sleep macrostructure, SWA during the first sleep cycle, whole night EEG spectral power across frequencies in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, and changes in subjective sleep measures were analyzed. The results revealed prolonged REM sleep latency after psilocybin administration and a trend toward a decrease in overall REM sleep duration. No changes in NREM sleep were observed. Psilocybin did not affect EEG power spectra in NREM or REM sleep when examined across the whole night. However, psilocybin suppressed SWA in the first sleep cycle. No evidence was found for sleep-related neuroplasticity, however, a different dosage, timing, effect on homeostatic regulation of sleep, or other mechanisms related to antidepressant effects may play a role. Overall, this study suggests that potential antidepressant properties of psilocybin might be related to changes in sleep."
"6128","1","Effect of Ketamine on Laboratory-induced Stress in Healthy Subjects.^
Stress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major depressive disorder (MDD) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience in at‐risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress‐induced psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience‐enhancing pharmaceuticals have been identified yet. Pre‐clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress prevents the developing of depressive‐like behavior in animals. In this project the study team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1‐week prior a laboratory‐induced stress (1) on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) ‐ Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis (HPA axis), adrenaline‐noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self‐reports of anxiety. The study team expects that subjects treated with ketamine, compared to midazolam, will experience reduced symptoms of negative affect and anxiety and a blunted hormonal response to an acute stress."
"4631","1","Cortisol levels and MDMA-induced memory impairment.^
Objective: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone1) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone1 (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with Metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA."

This study was designed to examine the rapid antidepressant effects of single dose ketamine on suicidal ideation and overall depression level in patients with newly-diagnosed cancer. Forty-two patients were enrolled into the controlled trial and randomized into two groups: ketamine group and midazolam group. Patients from the two groups received a sub-anesthetic dose of racemic ketamine hydrochloride or midazolam. Suicidal ideation score, measured with the Beck Scale and suicidal part of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, significantly decreased on day 1 and day 3 in ketamine-treated patients when compared to those treated with midazolam. Consistently, overall depression levels measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale indicated a significant relief of overall depression on day 1 in ketamine-treated patients. Collectively, this study provides novel information about the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine on acute depression and suicidal ideation in newly-diagnosed cancer patients."
"199","0","Modeling ""psychosis"" in vitro by inducing disordered neuronal network activity in cortical brain slices.^
INTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of neuronal networks has been suggested to underlie the cognitive and perceptual abnormalities observed schizophrenia. DISCUSSIONS: An in vitro model of psychosis is proposed based on the two different approaches to cause aberrant network activity in layer V pyramidal cells of prefrontal brain slices: (1) psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide and (2) minimal GABA(A) receptor antagonism, modeling the GABA interneuron deficit in schizophrenia. A test of this model would be to determine if drugs that normalize aberrant networks in brain slices have efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. Selective agonists of glutamate mGlu2/3 metabotropic receptors, which are highly effective in suppressing aberrant network activity in slices, are the most advanced toward reaching that clinical endpoint. In accord with the model, a recent phase II clinical trial shows that an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist is equivalent in efficacy to a standard antipsychotic drug for both negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but without the usual side effects. D1/5 dopamine receptor agonists are also effective in normalizing aberrant network activity induced by both hallucinogens and minimal GABA(A) antagonism; clinical efficacy remains to be determined. A general model of network regulation is presented, involving astrocytes, GABA interneurons, and glutamatergic pyramidal cells, revealing a wide range of potential sites hitherto not considered as therapeutic targets."

Aim The aim of the current study was to examine the long-term effect of an early adolescent substance abuse prevention program on trajectories and initiation of amphetamine use into early adulthood. Design Eight middle schools were assigned randomly to a program or control condition. The randomized controlled trial followed participants through 15 waves of data, from ages 11-28 years. This longitudinal study design includes four separate periods of development from early adolescence to early adulthood. Setting The intervention took place in middle schools. Participants A total of 1002 adolescents from one large mid-western US city were the participants in the study. Intervention The intervention was a multi-component community-based program delivered in early adolescence with a primary emphasis on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use. Measures At each wave of data collection participants completed a self-report survey that included questions about life-time amphetamine use. Findings Compared to a control group, participants in the Midwestern Prevention Project (MPP) intervention condition had reduced growth (slope) in amphetamine use in emerging adulthood, a lower amphetamine use intercept at the commencement of the early adulthood and delayed amphetamine use initiation. Conclusions The pattern of results suggests that the program worked first to prevent amphetamine use, and then to maintain the preventive effect into adulthood. Study findings suggest that early adolescent substance use prevention programs that focus initially on the 'gateway' drugs have utility for long-term prevention of amphetamine use."
"1269","1","Neural correlates of the psychedelic state as determined by fMRI studies with psilocybin.^
Psychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition."

Among these, eating disorders have been a recent target of interest. This review provides an up-to-date summary of the potential mechanisms and use of PAT in people diagnosed with eating disorders, with a focus on anorexia nervosa. RECENT FINDINGS: Classic psychedelics may have transdiagnostic efficacy through several mechanisms relevant to eating disorder pathology. Interest in, and efforts to increase access to PAT are both high. Early clinical trials are focused on establishing the safety and utility of this treatment in eating disorders, and efficacy remains unclear. High-quality published data to support the use of PAT for people with eating disorders remains lacking. Recent studies however suggest PAT has the potential to augment the efficacy of current interventions for these difficult-to-treat conditions."
"6891","1","Cognitive impairment after small-dose ketamine isomers in comparison to equianalgesic racemic ketamine in human volunteers.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is increasingly used in pain therapy but may impair brain functions. Mood and cognitive capacities were compared after equianalgesic small-dose S(+)-, R(-)-, and racemic ketamine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects received intravenous 0.5 mg/kg racemic, 0.25 mg/kg S(+)-, and 1.0 mg/kg R(-)-ketamine in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Hemodynamic variables, mood, and cognitive capacities were assessed for 60 min. RESULTS: Transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and catecholamines were similar after administration of all drugs. At 20 min after injection, subjects felt less decline in concentration and were more brave after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. They reported being less lethargic but more out-of-control after R(-)- than racemic ketamine. Ketamine isomers induced less drowsiness, less lethargy, and less impairment in clustered subjective cognitive capacity than racemic ketamine for the 60-min study. Objective concentration capacity [test time, S(+): 25.4 +/- 15.2 s, R(-): 34.8 +/- 18.4 s, racemic ketamine: 40.8 +/- 20.8 s, mean +/- SD] and retention in primary memory [test time, S(+): 4.6 +/- 1.2 s, R(-): 4.2 +/- 1.4 s, racemic ketamine: 4.0 +/- 1.4 s, mean +/- SD] declined less after S(+)- than either R(-)- or racemic ketamine at 1 min. At 5 min, immediate recall, anterograde amnesia, retention in primary memory, short-term storage capacity, and intelligence quotient were less reduced after the isomers than racemic ketamine. Speed reading and central information flow decreased less after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Early after injection, ketamine isomers induce less tiredness and cognitive impairment than equianalgesic small-dose racemic ketamine. In addition, S(+)-ketamine causes less decline in concentration capacity and primary memory. The differences in drug effects cannot be explained by stereoselective action on one given receptor."

OBJECTIVE: Using a patient-informed regimen, we conducted an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to systematically investigate the effects of psilocybin in cluster headache. BACKGROUND: Sustained reductions in cluster headache burden after limited quantities of psilocybin-containing mushrooms are anecdotally reported, although to date there are no controlled studies investigating these effects. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) in a pulse of three doses, each ~5 days apart. Participants maintained headache diaries starting 2 weeks before and continuing through 8 weeks after the first drug session. A total of 16 participants were randomized to receive experimental drug and 14 were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: In the 3 weeks after the start of the pulse regimen, the change in cluster attack frequency was 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 2.6) attacks/week with placebo (baseline 8.9 [95% CI 3.8 to 14.0]) and -3.2 (95% CI -8.3 to 1.9) attacks/week with psilocybin (baseline 9.6 [95% CI 5.6 to 13.6]; p = 0.251). Group difference in change from baseline had a moderate effect size (d = 0.69). The effect size was small in episodic participants (d = 0.35) but large in chronic participants (d = 1.25), which remained over the entire 8-week period measured (d = 0.81). Changes in cluster attack frequency were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during psilocybin administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated without any unexpected or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this initial, exploratory study provide valuable information for the development of larger, more definitive studies. Efficacy outcomes were negative, owing in part to the small number of participants. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects underscores the need for further investigation into the mechanism(s) of action of psilocybin in headache disorders."

"4414","1","Nicotine and smoker status moderate brain electric and mood activation induced by ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist.^
As the increased smoking prevalence in schizophrenics may be interpreted as an adaptive response to an underlying biological defect, investigations into nicotine's actions within N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist drug models of schizophrenia may improve our understanding of the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in initiating and maintaining nicotine dependence in this disorder. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, the electroencephalographic (EEG) and subjective response to a sub-psychotomimetic intravenous dose of the NMDA antagonist ketamine was examined in 20 regular smokers and 20 non-smokers pretreated with placebo or nicotine gum. Although nicotine increased EEG arousal, ketamine produced electrocerebral signs of brain activation (decreased slow wave power) and sedation (decreased fast wave power and frequency), which were not affected by nicotine pretreatment and were evident only in non-smokers. Ketamine increased a number of self-report indices of subjective arousal, some of which were attenuated and potentiated by nicotine in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. These findings suggest that long-term (evidenced by smoker vs. non-smoker comparisons) and short-term (acute) nicotine exposure may alter NMDA receptor-mediated arousal and mood systems in a way that promotes nicotine dependence in smokers, and addresses neurobiological deficiencies in smokers with schizophrenia.

"4215","0","Psilocybin in medicine and psychotherapy - an overview.^
Classic psychedelics such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were intensively researched in the context of substance-assisted psychotherapy in the 1950s and 60s and were evaluated as promising for a broad spectrum of mental disorders. However, due to government restrictions, scientific research into the therapeutic application of these substances came to an early halt. After a nearly 50-year hiatus, psychedelic research has experienced a resurgence with a growing number of controlled clinical trials conducted according to current methodological standards. Results of modern clinical trials suggest the safety and efficacy of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin (along with LSD and ayahuasca) for various mental disorders, with the most advanced data on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depression. While the results of modern clinical trials are promising, further studies with larger numbers of cases over a longer observation period are needed, as well as comparisons with conventional antidepressant treatments. These will be essential in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment approach and to achieve regulatory approval. In addition, the biological and psychotherapeutic mechanisms mediating the psychedelic and possibly antidepressant effects are only partially understood. This review presents the potential applications and treatment context of psilocybinassisted psychotherapy for depression."
"3315","0","Recent advances in the neuropsychopharmacology of serotonergic hallucinogens.^
Serotonergic hallucinogens, such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline, are somewhat enigmatic substances. Although these drugs are derived from multiple chemical families, they all produce remarkably similar effects in animals and humans, and they show cross-tolerance. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the primary site of hallucinogen action. The 5-HT2A receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of hallucinogens in human subjects, as well as in animal behavioral paradigms such as drug discrimination, head twitch response, prepulse inhibition of startle, exploratory behavior, and interval timing. Many recent clinical trials have yielded important new findings regarding the psychopharmacology of these substances. Furthermore, the use of modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques is beginning to help unravel how hallucinogens work in the brain. Evidence is also emerging that hallucinogens may possess therapeutic efficacy."

Ecstasy (MDMA) has regained popularity in powder and crystalline form, known as Molly. However, it is unknown whether all Molly users are aware that Molly is ecstasy. A total of 1045 nightclub/festival-attending adults in New York City were surveyed about ecstasy/MDMA/Molly use in 2016. Users were asked if they agreed that “Molly is (or is supposed to be) ecstasy/MDMA.” Of the 43.5% reporting lifetime use, 84.6% agreed that Molly is ecstasy, 9.5% disagreed, and 5.9% reported not knowing that Molly is ecstasy. Prevalence of use of other drugs (e.g., ketamine, opioids, methamphetamine, NBOMe, 2C series) was lowest among those not knowing that Molly is ecstasy, and highest among those not agreeing that Molly is ecstasy. Those not knowing that Molly is ecstasy were less likely to have used powder or crystal MDMA and less likely to have used in the past 12 months or to report intention to use again. Those disagreeing or not knowing that Molly is ecstasy were at over six times the odds of obtaining ecstasy from an unknown dealer, and those disagreeing were at four times higher odds of having suspected or found out that their ecstasy was adulterated. Results suggest that knowing or agreeing that Molly is ecstasy/MDMA can help indicate ecstasy-related risk."
"5131","1","A randomized comparison of nitrous oxide plus hematoma block versus ketamine plus midazolam for emergency department forearm fracture reduction in children.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine provides effective and relatively safe sedation analgesia for reduction of fractures in children in the emergency department. However, prolonged recovery and adverse effects suggest the opportunity to develop alternative strategies. We compared the efficacy and adverse effects of ketamine/midazolam to those of nitrous oxide/hematoma block for analgesia and anxiolysis during forearm fracture reduction in children. METHODS: Children 5 to 17 years of age were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (1 mg/kg)/midazolam (0.1 mg/kg; max: 2.5 mg) or 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen and a hematoma block (2.5 mg/kg of 1% buffered lidocaine). All of the children received oral oxycodone 0.2 mg/kg (max: 15 mg) at triage > or = 45 minutes before reduction. Videotapes were obtained before (baseline), during (procedure), and after (recovery) reduction and scored using the Procedure Behavioral Checklist by an observer blinded to study purpose. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist score from baseline to procedure, with greater change indicating greater procedure distress. Other outcome measures of efficacy included recovery times and visual analog scale scores to assess patient distress, parent report of child distress, and orthopedic surgeon satisfaction with sedation. Adverse effects were assessed during the emergency visit and by telephone 1 day after reduction. Data were analyzed using repeated measures, that is, analysis of variance, chi2, and t tests. RESULTS: There were 102 children (mean age: 9.0 +/- 3.0 years) who were randomly assigned. There was no difference in age, race, gender, and baseline Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores between ketamine/midazolam (55 subjects) and nitrous oxide/hematoma block (47 subjects). Mean changes in Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores were very small for both groups. The mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist was less for nitrous oxide/hematoma block, and patients and parents reported less pain during fracture reduction with nitrous oxide/hematoma block. Recovery times were markedly shorter for nitrous oxide/hematoma block compared with ketamine/midazolam. Orthopedic surgeons were similarly satisfied with the 2 regimens. Of the ketamine/midazolam subjects, 11% had O2 saturations < 94%. Other adverse effects occurred in both groups, but more often in ketamine/midazolam both during the emergency visit and at 1-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In children who had received oral oxycodone, both nitrous oxide/hematoma block and ketamine/midazolam resulted in minimal increases in distress during forearm fracture reduction at the doses studied. The nitrous oxide/hematoma block regimen had fewer adverse effects and significantly less recovery time."

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or “ecstasy”) is a popular recreational drug of abuse. In addition to its characteristic psychotropic effects, important cardiovascular effects have been described such as increased blood pressure and heart rate. MDMA was previously shown to behave as a partial agonist on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in the human internal thoracic artery in vitro, involving the 5-HT2A subtype. Here, we studied the interaction of MDMA (400, 800 and 1600 μM) with the following 5-HT receptor agonists: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, full agonist for the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors) and sumatriptan (selective 5-HT1B/1D receptors agonist). The results showed the ability of MDMA to influence the concentration-dependent response of 5-CT (97.3% of maximal reduction for 1600 μM of MDMA) and sumatriptan (72.43% of maximal reduction for 1600 μM of MDMA). The lower concentration of MDMA (400 μM) produced a significant potentiation of the response to sumatriptan thus suggesting an interaction of MDMA with the activation of 5-HT receptors, namely of the 5-HT1 subtype, in the peripheral vasculature. Together our results further support the importance of the affinity of MDMA to 5-HT receptors in the vascular effects of this drug."
"2134","0","A Critical Evaluation of Reports Associating Ayahuasca with Life-Threatening Adverse Reactions.^
Ayahuasca is a botanical hallucinogenic preparation traditionally consumed by Northwestern Amazonian indigenous groups. Scientific evidence suggests good tolerability after acute administration of ayahuasca and also after years or even decades of its ritual consumption. Nevertheless, some scientific and media reports associate ayahuasca or some of its alkaloids with severe intoxications. The purpose of the present text is to do a critical evaluation of these reports. The evaluation of the cases highlights the fact that some lack accurate forensic/toxicological information, while others are not directly relevant to traditional ayahuasca preparations. These limitations reduce the possibility of an accurate risk assessment, which could indicate potential contraindications and susceptibilities for ayahuasca consumption. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, the cases suggest that previous cardiac and hepatic pathologies and current use of serotonergic drugs/medications are contraindications to ayahuasca use, and that caution should be taken when using different botanical species and extracted/synthetic alkaloids to prepare ayahuasca analogues. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."

This study reports on the body image of depressed psychiatric outpatients, and the impact thereon of a dance movement therapy (DMT) group. Body image is perceived as a tri-partite construct consisting of image-properties, body-self, and body memory. Depressed patients in an outpatient mental health service participated in a DMT group treatment consisting of twelve 90-min long sessions in groups of 4–7 patients. Patients (N = 18) responded to a structured Body Image Assessment (BIA) before and after the treatment. Initially, the depressed patients’ body image was characterized by fragmentation, distortions, and shallowness of body awareness. The DMT group treatment aimed to offer the patients a safe space for exploring their embodied experiences in a validating social setting. This produced positive changes in the body image: finding a better sensation of one's body, tolerating the sensations, settling in the body, finding pleasure and meaningfulness in the experiences. BIA scores indicated large effect sizes in the change between pre- and post-treatment assessments. Change for more positive body image during the treatment predicted fewer depressive symptoms at the follow-up measurement."
"2004","1","Interaction of Sex and Age on the Dissociative Effects of Ketamine Action in Young Healthy Participants.^
Ketamine is a drug that reduces depressive and elicits schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans. However, it is largely unexplored whether women and men differ with respect to ketamine-action and whether age contributes to drug-effects. In this study we assessed dissociative symptoms via the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) in a total of 69 healthy subjects aged between 18 and 30 years (early adulthood) after ketamine or placebo infusion. Dissociative symptoms were generally increased only in the ketamine group post-infusion. Specifically, within the ketamine group, men reported significantly more depersonalization and amnestic symptoms than women. Furthermore, with rising age only men were less affected overall with respect to dissociative symptoms. This suggests a sex-specific protective effect of higher age which may be due to delayed brain maturation in men compared to women. We conclude that it is crucial to include sex and age in studies of drug effects in general and of ketamine-action in specific to tailor more efficient psychiatric treatments.

The haemodynamic changes following anaesthesia for hip surgery in 16 very old ASA II or III patients (mean age 85.8 +/- 5 years) were studied. Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group I 1 mg X kg-1 propofol, group II 1.5 mg X kg-1 ketamine. After injection, the patients were left spontaneously breathing oxygen, and were assisted when apneic. Haemodynamic measures with a Swan-Ganz catheter and thermodilution cardiac output calculator were made before and 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 min after anaesthetic induction. The two groups were similar in age, weight and mean arterial pressure, but statistically different for some haemodynamic parameters (Ppa, Ppw, CI). In group I, arterial pressure fell significantly (-17%) in the first minute and continued to fall (-15%) until the 15th min. Heart rate remained unchanged: right atrial and pulmonary pressures were not changed; cardiac index fell slightly and MVO2 estimated by the triple product fell (-27%) as soon as propofol was infused. There was no clinical sign of cardiac failure. In group II, arterial pressure increased significantly, and heart rate decreased; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased (+93% after the 3rd min) and cardiac index was unchanged. The ventricular function curve was shifted to the right, suggesting a decrease in inotropism. Systemic vascular resistances were steady. MVO2 increased twofold, mainly due to the rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"3903","1","Daily oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care: a 28-day open-label proof-of-concept trial.^
BACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent and undertreated in patients receiving hospice care. Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted. The findings of the potential efficacy of oral ketamine for depression and the response of anxiety symptoms are novel. Further investigation with randomized, controlled clinical trials is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other subject populations."

We urgently require new strategies for the treatment of comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence. Recent evidence has shown strong support for trauma‐focused integrated treatments (namely COPE), however only 49% demonstrate clinically significant improvements. MDMA may be a promising approach to improve response to COPE for this population. Emerging evidence suggests that MDMA‐assisted therapy may be of promise for PTSD, and has demonstrated a good safety profile and potential efficacy in alcohol dependence. This project will evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of MDMA‐assisted COPE relative to a placebo‐assisted COPE. We hypothesise that MDMA treated patients will be have a reduction in PTSD symptom severity as well as heavy drinking. We will utilise a double blind, randomised, controlled design.

Twelve heavy recreational ecstasy drug users (30-1000 occasions), 16 light ecstasy users (1-20 occasions) and 22 non ecstasy user controls, with group mean ages around 21 years, were compared. Three self-rating questionnaires were completed when drug-free: the SCL-90 (an outpatient psychiatric symptom checklist), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy (IVE) scale; and the uplifts, hassles, stresses and cognitive failures questionnaire. Heavy Ecstasy users reported significantly higher scores than controls on the following SCL-90 factors: paranoid ideation, psychoticism, somatisation, obsessionality, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, altered appetite and restless sleep, together with greater IVE impulsiveness. Light ecstasy users generally produced intermediate scores, with significantly higher scores than controls on two factors and significantly lower scores than heavy ecstasy users on another two. Previous reports have described various psychiatric and psychobiological disorders in recreational ecstasy users, but it is not known how typical they are, being mainly based on individual case studies. This is the first study to describe psychological problems in a non clinical sample of young recreational ecstasy users. However, our ecstasy users were polydrug users, with both groups showing significantly greater usage of amphetamine, LSD and cocaine, than the controls. These other illicit drugs probably contributed to their adverse psychobiological profiles, while there is also the possibility of pre-existing differences between ecstasy users and non users. However, since repeated MDMA can cause serotonergic neurotoxicity in laboratory animals and man, these problems may reflect reduced serotonin activity induced by regular ecstasy use.

"6762","1","Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy)-related myocardial hypertrophy: An autopsy study.^
Background: Myocardial hypertrophy is a well-recognized complication of cocaine and methamphetamine abuse and is a strong, independent risk factor for sudden death, myocardial infarction, and congestive heart failure. We sought to determine if use of MDMA (methylenedioxyamphetamine or ""ecstasy"") is associated with myocardial hypertrophy at death. Methods and results: A matched, retrospective study using medical examiner (ME) death reports. Consecutive MDMA positive (+) and MDMA negative (-) deaths identified from MEs in 10 states and a local county, respectively. Five MDMA(-) cases were matched to each MDMA(+) case for age, sex, and ethnicity. MDMA(+) cases were confirmed using GC/MS and other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) were absent. Matched MDMA(-) cases were trauma fatalities with intact hearts and blood negative for all illicit stimulants. Cardiac weights were compared between the two groups. Twenty seven MDMA(+) deaths and 135 matched MDMA(-) deaths were enrolled. Mean age was 20 years (range 16-33 years); 44% were female. 70.4% were Caucasian, 14.8% African-American, 11.1% Asian, and 3.7% Hispanic. Mean heart weight of MDMA(+) fatalities was 315.7 and 277.2 g for MDMA(-) fatalities (Diff = 38.5 g; 95% CI = 18.3-8.7). Multivariate analysis revealed that MDMA(+) fatalities were more likely to have an enlarged heart (OR = 18.3; 95% CI = 3.6-1.6). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that MDMA users might also be at risk for myocardial hypertrophy and possible cardiac toxicity, similar to other stimulants. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"4356","1","MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^
RATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs."
"7708","1","Crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy differ in relation to unsafe sex among young gay men.^
Objective: Poly-substance use in gay social ('club') settings is common. Recent studies suggest a link between 'club' drug use and sexual risk behaviours. In this qualitative study, we compare and contrast two 'club' drugs: crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy (MDMA). Methods: Life history interviews were conducted with 12 HIV seroconverters and 12 age-matched controls recruited from a prospective cohort study of young gay and bisexual men in Vancouver, British Columbia. Textual data concerning illicit substance use and unsafe sex were analyzed using NUDIST software. Results: Most men related a substantial knowledge of and experience with crystal and ecstasy. Both drugs had attributes that enhanced gay socialization and were used in the same venues. Crystal was used to remain awake and increase energy. Ecstasy was used to induce euphoria and group connectedness. However, unlike ecstasy, crystal was associated with a distinct pattern of sexual arousal that frequently included unprotected (sometimes group) sex, was more likely to be used regularly by HIV-positive men, and was reportedly highly addictive and problematic. Conclusion: Crystal and ecstasy are used in the same social venues but differ markedly in relation to sexual risk behaviour."
"6978","1","Effect of Psilocybin on Empathy and Moral Decision-Making.^
BACKGROUND: Impaired empathic abilities lead to severe negative social consequences and influence the development and treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, empathy has been shown to play a crucial role in moral and prosocial behavior. Although the serotonin system has been implicated in modulating empathy and moral behavior, the relative contribution of the various serotonin receptor subtypes is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the acute effect of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg p.o.) in healthy human subjects on different facets of empathy and hypothetical moral decision-making using the multifaceted empathy test (n=32) and the moral dilemma task (n=24). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased emotional, but not cognitive empathy compared with placebo, and the increase in implicit emotional empathy was significantly associated with psilocybin-induced changed meaning of percepts. In contrast, moral decision-making remained unaffected by psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behavior. Furthermore, together with previous findings, psilocybin appears to promote emotional empathy presumably via activation of serotonin 2A/1A receptors, suggesting that targeting serotonin 2A/1A receptors has implications for potential treatment of dysfunctional social cognition."

"6141","1","The Effect of S-ketamine for Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy (ECT).^
Nowadays, depression has become one of the serious mental diseases that affect human's life. With the acceleration of life pace and social pressure, the incidence of depression is increasing year‐on‐year. According to the statistics of the WHO, by 2017, there were more than 300 million people suffering from depression, accounting for 4.4% of the global population. Depression is highly related to suicide, which is an important reason for suicidal intention and attempt. It has been demonstrated that the incidence of suicide associated with major depression was as high as 15%. The main characteristic of depression is significant and lasting depression, which is caused by the decrease of monoamine transmitters (including dopamine, 5‐HT, et al.) related to mood. In the past, antidepressants mainly relied on increasing or reducing the metabolism of transmitters, but these drugs usually took weeks or even months to take effect, and although the symptoms of depression were relieved within weeks after the start of treatment, they were still not ideal in the long term. Therefore, the drug treatment of depression is not optimistic. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as the first biological therapy introduced into psychiatry, has been improving with the progress of technology and equipment. More studies show that ECT is a safe and effective treatment, and the treatment of severe depression is the first choice in some cases. However, cognitive dysfunction, relapse tendency and related safety after ECT need further study. Short acting sedatives and muscle relaxants before ECT can minimize the fear and muscle pain caused by ECT induced seizures. Previous sedatives used include propofol, mesaclopidol, thiopental and ketamine. Ketamine can be used for ECT anesthesia in patients with depression because of its good epileptic characteristics and prevention of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. More evidences reveal ketamine has strong antidepressant effect and reduces suicide of patients with treatment‐resistant depression or mania. The low dose of ketamine can take effect within one hour, produce rapid antidepressant effect, and can play a role in more than 70% of patients with refractory depression. In addition, even a single intravenous injection of ketamine can effectively reduce the symptoms of depression within 24‐72 hours, and may have synergistic antidepressant effect when combined with ECT. Although ketamine is considered to have a significant antidepressant effect in patients with depression, its application in mental disorders remains to be further explored because it may aggravate mental symptoms. However, some studies also found that ketamine did not significantly improve the effect of ECT on depression compared with other anesthetics. Esketamine is the isomer of ketamine, which mainly acts on NMDA receptor of glutamate and its affinity to the receptor is 3‐4 times that of ketamine, therefore it has stronger effect. Evidence suggests that esketamine can regulate NMDA receptor, increase the release of various neurotransmitters, improve the depression of patients, and repair the damaged neurons to improve the neuronal connections in the brain. As an anesthetic, the potency of esketamine is two times higher than ketamine, three times higher than R‐ketamine, and its drug metabolism time is shorter, and the related side effects are also significantly reduced. Conseuqently, it has been widely used as an anesthetic in some countries. The efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray as a rapid and effective antidepressant in the treatment of patients with refractory depression have been confirmed. However the effect of intravenous esketamine as an anesthetic in ECT anesthesia on patients who are depressed remains unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short‐term effect and safety of esketamine as a adjunctive anesthetic in routine ECT anesthesia for patients with depression."

BACKGROUND: Dissociation is a treatment-emergent adverse event commonly associated with IV ketamine, often measured using the 23-item Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The objective of this study was to develop a short form version of the CADSS for easier clinical use. METHODS: Retrospective data of 260 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) receiving IV ketamine were randomly divided into two datasets. The first dataset (n = 130) was leveraged to develop a brief 6-item version of the CADSS (CADSS-6) based on items most sensitive to ketamine-induced dissociation. The CADSS-6 questions were then applied to the second dataset (n = 130) and the Spearman's correlation between the full-length CADSS and the CADSS-6 were assessed. RESULTS: The CADSS-6 was developed from questions 1, 2, 6, 7, 15, and 22 from the full length CADSS. There was a strong significant correlation between the CADSS-6 total score and the CADSS total score at infusions 1 (rs(106) = 0.92, p < 0.001), 2 (rs(100) = 0.91, p < 0.001), 3(rs(99) = 0.95, p < 0.001) and 4 (rs(102) = 0.94, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The CADSS-6 was developed using a retrospective data; therefore, the scale remains unvalidated in this population. CONCLUSIONS: The CADSS-6 presented herein was sensitive to dissociation experienced by patients receiving IV ketamine. Overall, the CADSS-6 was strongly correlated at each infusion with the full-length CADSS. While future studies should look to validate the CADSS-6 in a TRD sample, this scale offers clinicians a brief assessment that can be used to characterize symptoms of dissociation."

A series of experiments administered a low dose range (0, 1.25, 2.5 and 5 mg/kg) of (±)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') to rats and assessed them in a variety of standard tests of anxiety. These tests included the emergence and elevated plus-maze tests, social interaction, cat odor avoidance and footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. MDMA increased anxiety-related behaviours in the emergence and elevated plus-maze tests at all dose levels. A 5 mg/kg dose of MDMA also significantly reduced the time spent in close proximity to an anxiogenic cat odor stimulus. The 5 mg/kg dose also significantly reduced footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. In the social interaction test, MDMA decreased aggressive behaviours at all doses tested, while the highest dose (5 mg/kg) also significantly increased the duration of social interaction. These results indicate that MDMA has both anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects depending upon the test situation employed. The facilitation of social interaction produced by MDMA in rats concurs with human experience of MDMA as a uniquely prosocial drug. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V."
"1522","1","Safety and efficacy of intranasal ketamine for acute postoperative pain.^
Background: Subanaesthetic doses of ketamine are analgesic. Intranasal administration offers a non-invasive route for systemic drug delivery. We evaluated the safety and analgesic efficacy of intranasal ketamine in treating moderate-to-severe, acute postoperative pain in the molar extraction model. Methods: Intranasal ketamine (10 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg) and placebo were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, parallel study in 40 patients undergoing removal of 2-4 impacted third molars. Analgesic efficacy was assessed over a 3 h period following drug administration. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting, vital signs, pulse oximetry, nasal assessments, and a standard dissociative side effects questionnaire. Results: Ketamine delivered intranasally was well tolerated. Statistically significant analgesia, superior to placebo, was observed with the highest dose tested, 50 mg, over a 3 h period. Rapid onset of analgesia was reported (<10 min), and meaningful pain relief was achieved within 15 min of the 50 mg dose. The majority of adverse events were mild/weak and transient. No untoward effects were observed on vital signs, pulse oximetry, and nasal examination. At the doses tested, no significant dissociative effects were evident using the Side Effects Rating Scale for Dissociative Anaesthetics. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine may offer a safe, nonopioid, well-tolerated, needle-free analgesic with efficacy in moderate-to-severe acute pain.

"732","0","Ketamine as Adjuvant to Opioids for Cancer Pain A Qualitative Systematic Review.^
Ketamine is increasingly being used as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of refractory cancer pain. This systematic review examines the available evidence. Randomized, controlled trials, with or without crossover, were included. Studies were identified from MEDLINE, EMBASE, CANCERLIT, the Cochrane Library, handsearched reference lists from review articles and chapters from standard textbooks on pain and palliative care and reference lists from papers retrieved. Four randomized, controlled studies were identified. Two were excluded due to poor quality. Both included studies concluded that ketamine improves morphine treatment in cancer pain. Quantitative meta-analysis was not possible. The available evidence is not sufficient to conclude that ketamine improves the effectiveness of opioid treatment in cancer pain. High quality, randomized, controlled trials with larger numbers of patients and standardized, clinically relevant routes of administration of ketamine are needed.

"1313","0","A brief history of oxytocin and its role in modulating psychostimulant effects.^
Over the past century, the polypeptide oxytocin has played an important role in medicine with major highlights including the identification of its involvement in parturition and the milk let-down reflex. Oxytocin is now implicated in an extensive range of psychological phenomena including reward and memory processes and has been investigated as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we first provide an historical overview of oxytocin and describe key aspects of its physiological activity. We then outline some pharmacological limitations in this field of research before highlighting the role of oxytocin in a wide range of behavioral and neuronal processes. Finally, we review evidence for a modulatory role of oxytocin with regard to psychostimulant effects. Key findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates a broad number of cocaine and methamphetamine induced behaviors and associated neuronal activity in rodents. Evidence also outlines a role for oxytocin in the prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) in both rodents and humans. Clinical trials should now investigate the effectiveness of oxytocin as a novel intervention for psychostimulant addiction and should aim to determine its specific role in the therapeutic properties of MDMA that are currently being investigated."

INTERVENTION: Over the two‐week experimental period, participants will receive all of the experimental doses. One dose will be taken at each session [i.e. active Methylphenidate (Ritalin) or placebo Methylphenidate (Ritalin)] and the order of dosing will be randomised. The active treatment is: 1. Methylphenidate (Ritalin) 10mg The placebo treatments are: 1. Placebo tablet (identical in taste, texture, weight and smell). Microcellulose tablet A one‐week washout period will occur between testing sessions. Prior to dosing at each testing visit (each at V1 and V2), participants will provide one saliva sample to screen for evidence of recent use of drugs [amphetamine/d‐methamphetamine, 3,4‐ methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), cocaine, cannabis (del ta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol) and opiates] using the Securetec DrugWipe 6s device.

"860","0","Clinical vs. laboratory identification of drugs of abuse in patients admitted for acute poisoning.^
Objective. The extent of drug abuse in patients admitted for self-poisonings is uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of drugs of abuse among patients admitted for acute poisoning according to age and gender, and to study the concordance between the clinical assessments by the physicians on duty and the drug analyses. Methods. Prospective cross sectional study of all patients (n = 405, 52% males, median age 31 years) treated for acute poisoning in our department during one year (2001). The physician on-call classified type of drug of abuse by history and clinical assessment. This was later compared to urine and blood samples analysed for ethanol, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, ecstasy, GHB, amphetamine and cannabis. Results. In 320 admissions ( 79 %), the comparison between clinical diagnosis and laboratory analyses could be performed. A total of 478 drugs were suspected and 621 were found. The main toxic agents found were benzodiazepines (49.7%), ethanol (40.3%), opiates (35.3%), cannabis (23.8%) and amphetamine (21.3%). Ninety-two had used drugs of abuse. The agreement between clinical assessments and laboratory findings was best for GHB and ethanol (kappa = 0.43), and for opiates (k = 0.38). For benzodiazepines and cannabis, the concordance was poor (k = 0.18 and 0.10, respectively). However, the correct clinical evaluation for these substances was 59% and 77%, respectively. Conclusions. Drugs of abuse were more frequently found than suspected clinically. Benzodiazepines, ethanol and opiates were most common. The agreement between clinical assessment and drug analyses was moderate to low. Physicians seem to underestimate the use of these drugs. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"4836","0","The effects of cannabis and alcohol on simulated arterial driving: Influences of driving experience and task demand.^
This study compared the effects of three doses of cannabis and alcohol (placebo, low and high doses), both alone and in combination, on the driving performance of young, novice drivers and more experienced drivers. Alcohol was administered as ethanol (95%) mixed with orange juice in doses of approximately 0, 0.4 and 0.6g/kg. Cannabis was administered by inhalation of smoke from pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes (supplied by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, USA). Active cigarettes contained 19 mg delta-9-THC. Using a counterbalanced design, the simulated driving performance of 25 experienced and 22 inexperienced drivers was tested under the nine different drug conditions in an arterial driving environment during which workload was varied through the drive characteristics as well as through the inclusion of a secondary task. High levels of cannabis generally induced greater impairment than lower levels, while alcohol at the doses used had few effects and did not produce synergistic effects when combined with cannabis. Both cannabis and alcohol were associated with increases in speed and lateral position variability, high dose cannabis was associated with decreased mean speed, increased mean and variability in headways, and longer reaction time, while in contrast alcohol was associated with a slight increase in mean speed. Given the limitations of the study, it is of great interest to further explore the qualitative impairments in driving performance associated with cannabis and alcohol separately and how these impairments may manifest in terms of crash characteristics."

One measure of a substance's addictive risk is the proportion of users who become dependent. This study evaluates the lifetime and current risk of substance dependence among lifetime substance users' among trauma inpatients and provides a relative ranking of addictive risk among the substances. Data on use of 8 substance groups (alcohol, opiates, marijuana, cocaine, other stimulants, sedative-hypnotics, hallucinogens, other drugs) were obtained by interview (Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R) from 1,118 adult trauma inpatients. Prevalence of lifetime dependence among lifetime users ranged from 80.7% for opiates and 70.9% for cocaine to 33.3% for hallucinogens and 26.6% for sedative-hypnotics. The rank order of addictive risk was similar to that found in the general population. Trauma inpatients had a higher absolute addictive risk than the general population, comparable to the risk found in patients in treatment for substance use disorders, suggesting the importance of screening trauma inpatients for substance dependence.

In the search for new techniques that might enhance the efficacy of psychotherapy, particularly in those patients whose motivational powers have been weakened or lost, a compound such as LSD may hold considerable promise. This is reinforced by the fact that the experiences in this study indicate that trained personnel can implement the psychedelic procedure with relatively high safety and replicate its major objective, the peak experience, to a degree that makes the phenomenon difficult to sweep under the experimental rug. At the same time, it underscores the need for controlled studies, an objective that may be very difficult to achieve in view of the unique nature of the drug experience and its therapeutic objective."
"5446","1","A proof-of-concept investigation into ketamine as a pharmacological treatment for alcohol dependence: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Worldwide, alcohol abuse is a burgeoning problem. Abstinence is key to allow recovery of physical and mental health as well as quality of life, but treatment for alcohol dependence is associated with high relapse rates. Preliminary data have suggested that a combined repeated ketamine and psychological therapy programme may be effective in reducing relapse in severe alcohol use disorder. This non-commercial proof-of-concept trial is aimed at making a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of this combined treatment in this patient group. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial taking place in two sites in the UK: the South West of England and London. Ninety-six recently detoxified alcoholics, with comorbid depressive symptoms, will be randomised to one of four treatment arms. Patients will receive either three sessions of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes) or placebo (50 ml saline 0.9% IV over 40 minutes) plus either seven sessions of manualised psychological therapy or an alcohol education control. Patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months on a range of psychological and biological variables. The primary endpoints are (1) relapse rates at 6 months and (2) percentage days abstinent at 6 months. Secondary endpoints include 3 and 6 month percentage days abstinence, tolerability (indicated by dropout), adverse events, depressive symptoms, craving and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information on a new combined psychological and pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. The findings would have broad application given the worldwide prevalence of alcoholism and its associated medical, psychological and social problems.

"8704","1","Harm related to recreational ketamine use and its relevance for the clinical use of ketamine. A systematic review and comparison study.^
BACKGROUNDS: Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is currently considered for several new indications. AIM: To deduce the safety of long-term ketamine treatment using the harm of heavy recreational (non-medical) ketamine use as a proxy for maximal possible harm of ketamine treatment. METHODS: Systematic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines to identify controlled studies on ketamine-related harm in heavy recreational ketamine users. Results were compared with serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients treated with ketamine according to three systematic reviews considering dosing regimen and cumulative dose. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 25 studies. Heavy recreational ketamine use can escalate to ketamine dependency and was often dose-dependently associated with other SAEs, including cognitive and mental disorders, and gastrointestinal and urinary tract symptoms, which disappeared upon marked reduction of ketamine use. Heavy ketamine users have a much higher cumulative exposure to ketamine than ketamine treated patients (>90 times), which may explain why SAEs in the clinical context are mostly mild and reversible and why ketamine dependence was not reported in these patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with ketamine is not associated with ketamine dependency or SAEs. However, caution is needed since data on long-term clinical ketamine use with a long-term follow-up is lacking."
"8320","1","Dose-response study of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans. II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^
BACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate ""nonblind,"" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. ""Loss of control,"" associated with a brief, but overwhelming ""rush,"" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans. They also may be used to compare the effects of other agents affecting relevant brain receptors in volunteer and psychiatric populations."

While several empirical studies have focused on Ecstasy use among rave attendees, only one study has explored the validity of self-reported Ecstasy use within this population. To address this limitation, the authors collected self-report drug use information and oral fluid (OF) specimens from 96 club rave attendees within the Baltimore-Washington corridor between August and October 2000. The Kappa statistic is 0.59, suggesting a moderate relationship between the self-report and OF measures. Such accurate reporting bodes well for researchers interested in eliciting sensitive information from this population."

Serotonergic psychedelic drugs, such as psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), profoundly alter the quality of consciousness through mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Growing evidence suggests that a single psychedelic experience can positively impact long-term psychological well-being, with relevance for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including depression. A prominent factor associated with psychiatric disorders is disturbed sleep, and the sleep-wake cycle is implicated in the homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent psychedelic agents directly affect sleep, in terms of both acute arousal and homeostatic sleep regulation. Here, chronic electrophysiological recordings were obtained in mice to track sleep-wake architecture and cortical activity after psilocin injection. Administration of psilocin led to delayed REM sleep onset and reduced NREM sleep maintenance for up to approximately 3 h after dosing, and the acute EEG response was associated primarily with an enhanced oscillation around 4 Hz. No long-term changes in sleep-wake quantity were found. When combined with sleep deprivation, psilocin did not alter the dynamics of homeostatic sleep rebound during the subsequent recovery period, as reflected in both sleep amount and EEG slow-wave activity. However, psilocin decreased the recovery rate of sleep slow-wave activity following sleep deprivation in the local field potentials of electrodes targeting the medial prefrontal and surrounding cortex. It is concluded that psilocin affects both global vigilance state control and local sleep homeostasis, an effect which may be relevant for its antidepressant efficacy. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"5838","1","Acute Effects of Ketamine Infusion on Postoperative Mood Scores in Patients Undergoing Dilation and Curettage: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.^
BACKGROUND: Emotional and psychological effects following abortion are more common than physical side effects and can range from mild regret to more serious complications such as depression. In the last decade, it has been suggested that low dose of ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative ketamine infusion on postoperative mood score in patients undergoing Dilation and Curettage (D&C) under spinal anesthesia. We hypothesized that a single low-dose administration of ketamine infusion during D&C surgery can improve mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study included a total of 60 patients, ≥18 years, physical status ASA II, with up to 12-week gestation undergoing elective D&C surgery. Patients were divided randomly into a ketamine group (group K) and a control group (group C). In group K, 0.4 mg/kg ketamine was given as a continuous infusion over 20 min intraoperatively. Main Outcome Measure. Profile of Mood States (POMS) was recorded preoperatively and 2 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no differences in preoperative POMS between the two groups. Mean postoperative POMS of group K was lower than that of group C indicating mood improvement. Ketamine group patients showed higher sedation score and increased, although self-limiting, psychedelic phenomena than the control group. CONCLUSION: Observed data here support an acute effect of ketamine on mood but any further claim will be speculative. Further future studies exploring postoperative mood scores after 24 hours post-infusion are needed. This trial is registered with PACTR201907779292947."
"3767","1","Self-medication with psychedelic microdoses amongst microdosers with disorders.^
Background: A substantial number of people worldwide suffer from mental health problems during their lifetime. Although standard therapy and prescriptions are often effective, it is known that treatment is not a ""one‐size‐fits‐all"" cure; many patients experience unbearable side effects, and some never reach remission. In light of this, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, with preliminary clinical trials using 'regular' full psychedelic doses demonstrating promising results. Over the last couple of years, the use of low 'micro' doses of psychedelics for health‐related purposes has received increased visibility and interest to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression or pain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that next to regular psychedelic doses, low doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing for symptomatic relief is lacking and no scientific effort is made to inquire on a larger scale for which conditions people use psychedelic microdoses and whether they deem this to be more effective than standard treatments (ST) or 'regular' high psychedelic doses (HPD). The present study therefore investigated the self‐rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP), compared to ST and HDP. Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora for four months. In total 63% (N = 3'590) of the people who initially clicked the link consented and were 18 years of age or older and completed the survey. Of them, 7.2% (N = 410) had experience with microdosing and was diagnosed by a medical doctor or therapist with at least one mental or physical disorder. This group was included in the analyses. Respondents were asked which psychedelics they used to selfmedicate with, for which condition and whether they experienced it as effective. The latter was assessed with three questions: 'Do you feel the treatment worked' (Q1), 'did the symptoms disappear' (Q2), and 'did your quality of life improve' (Q3). Binary logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) was conducted to compare the SRE with psychedelic microdoses with ST, and HDP, for the mental and physical disorder diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions. When cell count was less than 10 events per independent variable, no regression was conducted. For each OR, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given and statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. An OR of 1.5 is defined as small, two as medium, and three as large. Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was statistically higher (p < 0.01) compared to that of ST for both mental (OR(Q1) = 2.3; OR(Q2) = 2.48; OR(Q3) = 2.77) and physical (OR(Q1) = 6.14; OR(Q2) = 7.74; OR(Q3) = 4.36) diagnoses. These effects were specific for neurodevelopmental and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression (OR (Q1) = 0.15; OR(Q2) = 0.31; OR(Q3) = 0.13; p(OR Q1,2,3) < 0.01), while for physical disorders no difference was shown (OR(Q1) = 0.45, p = 0.27; OR(Q2) = 0.79, p = 0.79; OR(Q3) = 0.25, p = 0.09). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physical diagnoses is higher compared to ST and lower than HDP. Findings provide a rationale to assess indications of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics using randomized clinical trials in patient populations, and support assessment of effectivity claims of psychedelics, and whether these are dose‐related, disorder‐specific and superior to ST."
"8953","1","Combining Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for PTSD with 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA): A Case Example.^
Treatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have evolved significantly in the past 35 years. From what was historically viewed as a pervasive, intractable condition have emerged multiple evidence-based intervention options. These treatments, predominantly cognitive behavioral in orientation, provide significant symptom improvement in 50-60% of recipients. The treatment of PTSD with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy using a supportive, non-directive approach has yielded promising results. It is unknown, however, how different therapeutic modalities could impact or improve outcomes. Therefore, to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches, Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for PTSD (CBCT) was combined with MDMA in a small pilot trial. The current article provides a case study of one couple involved in the trial, chosen to provide a demographically representative example of the study participants and a case with a severe trauma history, to offer a detailed account of the methodology and choices made to integrate CBCT and MDMA, as well as an account of their experience through the treatment and their treatment gains. This article offers a description of the combination of CBCT for PTSD and MDMA, and demonstrates that it can produce reductions in PTSD symptoms and improvements in relationship satisfaction."
"5274","1","A randomized controlled trial of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and fear extinction retention in healthy adults.^
BACKGROUND: Fear conditioning and extinction are well-characterized cross-species models of fear-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and recent animal data suggest that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances fear extinction retention. AIMS: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. METHODS: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24 hours later, and 2 hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48 hours after extinction training. Participants (N = 34; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (χ(2) = 7.29, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention, the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention.Clinical Trials Registry Name and Identifier: Evaluation of MDMA on Startle Response (NCT0318176) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03181763?term = MDMA&draw = 2&rank = 9."

"5667","0","Success rate of verbal de-escalation in the treatment of agitated patients in the emergency department.^
Background: Patients with agitation due to psychiatric illness, intoxication, and other medical conditions frequently present to the ED. When verbal deescalation fails, they often require physical restraint, chemical restraint, or seclusion. Objective: To determine the success rate of verbal de‐escalation for agitated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Methods: This was a cross‐sectional study at an urban, Level 1 Trauma Center with 108,000 annual visits. Data collection was performed by trained research associates. We prospectively screened all patients in the ED for agitation during a randomized distribution of 440 8‐hour shifts totaling 3,520 hours over a 20‐month period. All patients were assessed using the altered mental status score (AMS), a validated 9 point scale ranging from unresponsive (‐4) to normal (0) to severely agitated (+4). Patients with an AMS score of >1 were considered agitated. Verbal de‐escalation is the initial approach for all agitated patients presented to this ED. Verbal de‐escalation was considered successful if the patient did not require the use of physical or chemical restraint, or seclusion. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 43,848 patients were screened, 1,146 (2.6%) had an agitation score >1. The median agitation score on presentation was 2.79, range 2 to 4. Verbal deesclation alone was successful for up to the initial hour of treatment in 32% of patients, and adequate for the duration of their care in the ED in 10.6% of patients. Physical restrains were used in 44.3% of patients, parenteral medication was used to treat agitation in 56.1% (42% Olanzapine, 26% Droperidol, 22% haloperidol, 5% Lorazepam, 4% Ketamine), 35.5% were treated with seclusion in a locked unit. 68% of agitated patients were determined to be primarily due to intoxication, 24% due to an exacerbation of psychiatric illness, and 8% due to some other medical condition. Conclusion: Verbal de‐escalation was sufficient to control agitation in 10.6% of patients presenting to the ED with agitation for the duration of their ED visit. 68% of agitated patients required parenteral medication, physical restraint, seclusion, or some combination of these in the first hour of their treatment. Further work to determine which situations are associated with successful verbal de‐escalation may result in more precise use of other interventions."
"7328","1","Prevalence and risk factors for LSD use among young women.^
Study Objective: To report the lifetime prevalence of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and to identify unique correlates of using this substance in the last year among a large multiethnic sample of sexually active adolescent and young adult women aged 14 to 26 yrs. Design, Setting, Participants: A cross-sectional survey, administered at university-based ambulatory reproductive health clinics, was completed by 904 women between April and November of 1997 to identify risk factors associated with their use of LSD within the past 12 months. Subjects who reported lifetime, but not past 12 months', use of marijuana, LSD, or other illicit drugs were excluded, leaving a sample of 368 nonusers and 56 users of LSD. In addition, 231 young women who reported only using marijuana in the last year were used as a comparison group to identify unique factors associated with LSD use. Results: Of the total sample (n=904), 13% (n=119) reported lifetime use of LSD, and 58% (n=536) reported lifetime use of marijuana. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age and race/ethnicity found distinct profiles for those who reported using LSD or only marijuana in the last year when compared to those who reported no substance use. Common to both groups was reporting being drunk at least 10 times during the last year, regular smoking of at least half a pack of cigarettes, and identification as a high-sexual-risk taker. However, LSD users as compared to nonusers were more likely to report white ethnicity (as compared to nonwhite), be less than or equal to 17 years of age (as compared to at least 18 years), report a history of physical abuse, and be categorized as having severe depressive symptomatology. In contrast, those who reported only using marijuana were more likely to report single marital status, young age at first intercourse, having half or more of their friends use marijuana, and poor grades. Conclusions: The female LSD user presents a distinct profile that might aid clinicians in identifying potential LSD use in this population as well as alerting clinicians to the relationship between LSD use and high-risk sexual behaviors."
"6410","0","Evaluation of dextromethorphan with select antidepressant therapy for the treatment of depression in the acute care psychiatric setting.^
INTRODUCTION: Dextromethorphan (DXM), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, may have ketamine-like antidepressant effects. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, and its half-life in extensive metabolizers is 2 to 4 hours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of DXM in combination with a moderate-to-strong CYP2D6 inhibitor antidepressant on depression in an acute care psychiatric setting. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of adult patients with a depressive disorder diagnosis. Patients who received select antidepressant therapy with or without scheduled DXM were included. The primary outcome was the difference in time to improvement of depressive symptoms, which was an average composite of physician documentation, nurse documentation, and first time to 24 hours without as-needed anxiolytics or antipsychotics. The study group consisted of patients who received DXM with select antidepressant therapy, whereas the control group included those who received only select antidepressant therapy. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included. The median time to clinical improvement was 3.00 days and 2.83 days for the study group and control group, respectively (P = .986). The incidence of perceptual disturbances and delusions was higher in the study group as compared with the control group (55% and 35% vs 30% and 25%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Dextromethorphan was not associated with a rapid antidepressant effect. The commonly used dose of 30 mg daily may have been too low to have an effect; additionally, the most frequently utilized select antidepressant, bupropion, has moderately less CYP2D6 inhibition than fluoxetine and paroxetine."
"5467","1","Quantitative PET studies of the serotonin transporter in MDMA users and controls using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB.^
(+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') is a widely used illicit drug that produces toxic effects on brain serotonin axons and axon terminals in animals. The results of clinical studies addressing MDMA's serotonin neurotoxic potential in humans have been inconclusive. In the present study, 23 abstinent MDMA users and 19 non-MDMA controls underwent quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, first- and second-generation serotonin transporter (SERT) ligands previously validated in baboons for detecting MDMA-induced brain serotonin neurotoxicity. Global and regional distribution volumes (DVs) and two additional SERT-binding parameters (DV(spec) and DVR) were compared in the two subject populations using parametric statistical analyses. Data from PET studies revealed excellent correlations between the various binding parameters of [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, both in individual brain regions and individual subjects. Global SERT reductions were found in MDMA users with both PET ligands, using all three of the above-mentioned SERT-binding parameters. Preplanned comparisons in 15 regions of interest demonstrated reductions in selected cortical and subcortical structures. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested that SERT measures recover with time, and that loss of the SERT is directly associated with MDMA use intensity. These quantitative PET data, obtained using validated first- and second-generation SERT PET ligands, provide strong evidence of reduced SERT density in some recreational MDMA users."
"7269","1","Use of amphetamine by recreational users of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with reduced striatal dopamine transporter densities: A [123I]β-CIT SPECT study - Preliminary report.^
Rationale: Tablets sold as ecstasy often contain not only 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) but other compounds well known to cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, such as (meth)amphetamine. Furthermore, the use of ecstasy in the Netherlands is often combined with the use of amphetamine. However, little is known about the effects of ecstasy use or the combination of ecstasy and amphetamine use on dopamine (DA) neurones in the human brain. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the effects of ecstasy as well as the combined use of ecstasy and amphetamine on the density of nigrostriatal DA neurones. Methods: [123I]β-CIT SPECT was used to quantify striatal DA transporters. Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios of control subjects (n=15) were compared with binding ratios of ecstasy users (n=29) and individuals with a history of combined ecstasy and amphetamine use (n=9) after adjustment for age. Results: Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios were significantly lower in combined ecstasy and amphetamine users compared to sole ecstasy users (6.75 versus 8.46, respectively: -20.2%, P=0.007). Binding ratios were significantly higher in ecstasy users when compared to controls (8.46 versus 7.47, respectively: +13.2%, P=0.045). Conclusions: These initial observations suggest that the sole use of ecstasy is not related to dopaminergic neurotoxicity in humans. In contrast, the reported use of amphetamine by regular users of ecstasy seems to be associated with a reduction in nigrostriatal DA neurones."
"2048","1","Investigating the role of serotonin in visual orientation processing using an 'ecstasy' (MDMA)-based research model.^
Aims/Objectives:A growing body of evidence suggests that regular 'ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use causes lasting changes to central serotonergic functioning in humans, including in the occipital lobe. Serotonin may play a role in visual orientation processing, mediated in the occipital lobe, via lateral inhibition. The tilt aftereffect is an illusion apparent following adaptation to stimuli angled 5-50° from vertical and thought to be affected by lateral inhibition between occipital neurons. A recent study identified an enhanced tilt aftereffect among ecstasy users, but only in a subset that were recently abstinent from amphetamines. The current study examined the effects of ecstasy use, cannabis use and their interacting effect on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect among participants with no recent history of amphetamine consumption. Materials and Methods: Eleven ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users, 15 ecstasy plus cannabis users and 15 drug-naïve controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect elicited following adaptation to stimuli angled 15, 30, 40 or 60° from vertical. Results:At a 40° adaptation condition, ecstasy users had a greater magnitude of the tilt aftereffect compared to those that had not taken the drug. Additionally, the extent of ecstasy use was positively associated with the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect generated following 15, 30 and 40° adaptation conditions, but not at 60°. Conclusions:Given that lateral inhibition mediates the tilt aftereffect following adaptation to 5-50°, the findings of a relationship between ecstasy use and tilt magnitude at the 15-40° but not 60° adaptation conditions support a role for serotonin in visual orientation processing via lateral inhibition.

"808","1","Combination therapy with transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine for treatment-resistant depression: a long-term retrospe.^
Background: Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). Methods: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2‐4.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10‐30 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up. Results: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test (α=0.01, t=22.81 p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. Conclusions: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."
"5568","1","Effectiveness and Safety of Ketamine for Unipolar Depression: a Systematic Review.^
Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder with major implications for healthcare system and socioeconomic burden. For chronic and treatment-resistant depression, Ketamine has emerged as a possible treatment option. This systematic review explores the evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of Ketamine in patients with MDD. This systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Eight electronic databases were searched by using search terms: (ketamine) AND (trial OR RCT OR clinical-trial) AND (depressive OR depression OR ""depressive-disorder""). After a rigorous screening process against the predetermined eligibility criteria, 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Quality assessment of included studies was done by using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. Thirty-five RCTs are included in this review article with majority of studies from United States, Iran, and China. Intravenous (IV) Ketamine was effective in 70% (21/30) of the included studies whereas oral and Intranasal (IN) Ketamine were effective in two and three studies, respectively. The majority of studies (6/8) using Ketamine as anesthetic agent during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) failed to show an improvement compared to the participants receiving ECT and placebo. The most common reported side effects were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diplopia, drowsiness, dysphoria, hallucinations, and confusion. Ketamine is an effective treatment option for patients with MDD with undesirable effects when administered via oral, IV and IN routes. Ketamine agumentation of ECT requires further exploration in well-designed studies with adequate sample size. The short-lived antidepressant effect of Ketamine is a potential limitation, therefore, further studies administering multiple infusions for acute treatment and maintenance are necessary."
"692","1","Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^
Recovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials."
"2927","1","Long-lasting effects of (±)3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy) on serotonin system function in humans.^
Background: Fifteen (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users, who did not show other drug dependencies or prolonged alcohol abuse, and 15 control subjects were included in the study. Methods: Prolactin (PRL) and cortisol (CORT) responses to the serotonergic agonist d-fenfluramine (D-fen), clinical psychobehavioral changes, and psychometric measures were evaluated 3 weeks and then 12 months after MDMA discontinuation. Results: MDMA users showed significantly reduced PRL and CORT responses in comparison with control subjects at 3 weeks (respectively, p < .001; p < .005). The responses of PRL to D-fen were unmodified at 12 months after prolonged abstinence and were significantly reduced in comparison with controls (p < .001). In contrast, CORT responses in MDMA users were restored after 12 months of abstinence, with significantly higher responses to D-fen, in comparison with 3-week responses (p < .05). MDMA users' high scores on the Novelty Seeking (NS) scale on the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) appeared unchanged by long-term abstinence. In contrast, Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) (Buss and Durkee 1957) direct and guilt scores decreased significantly after 12 months of abstinence. PRL AUCs at 12 months were inversely correlated with the measures of MDMA exposure (r = -.538). Conclusions: Our data indicate long-lasting 5-HT system impairment in abstinent MDMA users although the hypothesis of serotonergic changes attributable to a premorbid condition cannot be excluded. CORT restored responses to D-fen at 12 months, and the correlation of neuroendocrine changes with MDMA exposure suggest that the neuroendocrine impairment may be due to a partially reversible neurotoxic action of MDMA on the human brain.

This study focused on the in vivo effects of the κ-opioid hallucinogen salvinorin A, derived from the plant Salvia divinorum. The effects of salvinorin A (0.0032-0.056 mg/kg i.v.) were studied in a neuroendocrine biomarker assay of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin in gonadally intact, adult male and female rhesus monkeys (n = 4 each). Salvinorin A produced dose- and time-dependent neuroendocrine effects, similar to the synthetic high-efficacy κ-agonist U69,593 ((+)-(5α,7 α,8β)-N- methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidiniyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8yl]-benzeneacetamide), but of shorter duration than the latter. Salvinorin A was approximately equipotent to U69,593 in this endpoint (salvinorin A ED50, 0.015 mg/kg; U69,593 ED50, 0.0098 mg/kg). The effects of i.v. salvinorin A were not prevented by a small dose of the opioid antagonist nalmefene (0.01 mg/kg s.c.) but were prevented by a larger dose of nalmefene (0.1 mg/kg); the latter nalmefene dose is sufficient to produce κ-antagonist effects in this species. In contrast, the 5HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) did not prevent the effects of salvinorin A. As expected, the neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin A (0.0032 mg/kg i.v.) were more robust in female than in male subjects. Related studies focused on full-length cloning of the coding region of the rhesus monkey κ-opioid receptor (OPRK1) gene and revealed a high homology of the nonhuman primate OPRK1 gene compared with the human OPRK1 gene, including particular C-terminal residues thought to be involved in receptor desensitization and internalization. The present studies indicate that the hallucinogen salvinorin A acts as a high-efficacy κ-agonist in nonhuman primates in a translationally viable neuroendocrine biomarker assay.

Clinical and preclinical studies suggest that dysfunction of the glutamatergic system is implicated in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. In clinical studies of individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, rapid reductions in depressive symptoms have been observed in response to subanesthetic-dose ketamine, an agent whose mechanism of action involves the modulation of glutamatergic signaling. The findings from these studies have prompted the repurposing and/or development of other glutamatergic modulators for antidepressant efficacy, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to conventional monoaminergic antidepressants.

The non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine leads to transient psychosis-like symptoms and impairments in oculomotor performance in healthy volunteers. This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS) and antisaccades (AS) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups (intravenous 100 ng ml(-1) ketamine, 2 mg oral risperidone, 100  ng ml(-1) ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone, placebo). Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events. Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P < 0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P > or = 0.07). An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P < or = 0.04). No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found (all P > or = 0.26). The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia."
"9565","1","Comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in bipolar and unipolar depression.^
Objectives: Anhedonia is a common, persistent, and disabling phenomenon in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) and bipolar depression (BD). This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD. Methods: Ninety-seven individuals suffering from MDD (n = 77) or BD (n = 20) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered over 40 min. Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion, respectively. Results: Anti-anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5% (95% confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6%) and 30.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3%), respectively. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

"5621","1","Ayahuasca's Antidepressant Effects Covary with Behavioral Activation as Well as Mindfulness.^
Ayahuasca, a plant-based hallucinogen that serves as a spiritual medicine in South America, has improved depression in at least one placebo-controlled clinical trial. Case studies suggest that dramatic behavioral changes often follow the Ayahuasca ceremony, but most explanations of antidepressant effects focus on changes in mindfulness. This study investigated whether both mindfulness and behavioral activation might contribute to these anti-depressant effects. We surveyed individuals (N = 152) about their changes in depressive symptoms, behavioral activation, and mindfulness after an Ayahuasca experience. Mindfulness was strongly associated with reduced depression severity (r = - .670, p < .001), while behavioral activation was moderately linked (r = - .474, p < .001). Changes in depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Sciences Depression Short Form [CES-D-10]) covaried with subscales from the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ] and Experiences Questionnaire [EQ], confirming previous findings (β = -.57, 95% CI -5.70, -3.25), p < .001). In addition, a modification of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form [BADS-SF] accounted for significant unique variance in the improvements in depression (β = - .16, 95% CI -6.32, -0.08), p < .05). Changes in behavioral activation likely serve as a mechanism underlying Ayahuasca's antidepressant effects. Future clinical trials could benefit from tracking behavioral activation."

"7488","1","Ayahuasca, a potentially rapid acting antidepressant: focus on safety and tolerability.^
INTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a psychedelic brew originally used by Amazonian indigenous groups and in religious rituals. Pre-clinical and observational studies have demonstrated its possible potential as an antidepressant, and open- and placebo-controlled clinical trials corroborated these results. For it to become an approved treatment for depression, its safety and tolerability need to be assessed and documented. AREAS COVERED: We have gathered data regarding the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in all reported randomized, placebo-controlled trials with healthy and clinical populations involving ayahuasca administration (n = 108 ayahuasca administrations). We systematically categorized these results, recorded their prevalence, and discussed the possible mechanisms related to their emergence. EXPERT OPINION: There were no reports of serious AEs, indicating a relative safety of ayahuasca administration in controlled settings. Most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, headaches, and transient increases in cardiovascular measurements. Ayahuasca research is still in its infancy, especially concerning the absence of large and robust clinical trials to verify its antidepressant effects. Dose standardization, legal prohibition of the possession of its alkaloids and how traditional communities will be compensated if ayahuasca becomes an approved medicine are the biggest obstacles to overcome for its future use in the therapeutic context."

Psilocybin recently received breakthrough status by the FDA for its use in treatment of depression. We therefore investigated mental health professionals’ (MHPs) opinions on Psilocybin (n = 155). Overall, attitudes were neutral but self-rated knowledge of Psilocybin was low. The term used in the survey, ‘Psilocybin’ or ‘Magic Mushrooms’, did not significantly affect their responses. Some variables (i.e., gender, attitudes towards medical cannabis, and personal history of psychedelic usage) were associated with ratings of Psilocybin. These results provide a baseline of MHPs' thoughts on Psilocybin and what should be considered in the future if it is FDA-approved."

RATIONALE: Is it possible to have a psychedelic experience from a placebo alone? Most psychedelic studies find few effects in the placebo control group, yet these effects may have been obscured by the study design, setting, or analysis decisions. OBJECTIVE: We examined individual variation in placebo effects in a naturalistic environment resembling a typical psychedelic party. METHODS: Thirty-three students completed a single-arm study ostensibly examining how a psychedelic drug affects creativity. The 4-h study took place in a group setting with music, paintings, coloured lights, and visual projections. Participants consumed a placebo that we described as a drug resembling psilocybin, which is found in psychedelic mushrooms. To boost expectations, confederates subtly acted out the stated effects of the drug and participants were led to believe that there was no placebo control group. The participants later completed the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, which measures changes in conscious experience. RESULTS: There was considerable individual variation in the placebo effects; many participants reported no changes while others showed effects with magnitudes typically associated with moderate or high doses of psilocybin. In addition, the majority (61%) of participants verbally reported some effect of the drug. Several stated that they saw the paintings on the walls ""move"" or ""reshape"" themselves, others felt ""heavy… as if gravity [had] a stronger hold"", and one had a ""come down"" before another ""wave"" hit her. CONCLUSION: Understanding how context and expectations promote psychedelic-like effects, even without the drug, will help researchers to isolate drug effects and clinicians to maximise their therapeutic potential."
"1232","0","Serotonergic Psychedelics: Experimental Approaches for Assessing Mechanisms of Action.^
Recent, well-controlled - albeit small-scale - clinical trials show that serotonergic psychedelics, including psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide, possess great promise for treating psychiatric disorders, including treatment-resistant depression. Additionally, fresh results from a deluge of clinical neuroimaging studies are unveiling the dynamic effects of serotonergic psychedelics on functional activity within, and connectivity across, discrete neural systems. These observations have led to testable hypotheses regarding neural processing mechanisms that contribute to psychedelic effects and therapeutic benefits. Despite these advances and a plethora of preclinical and clinical observations supporting a central role for brain serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors in producing serotonergic psychedelic effects, lingering and new questions about mechanisms abound. These chiefly pertain to molecular neuropharmacology. This chapter is devoted to illuminating and discussing such questions in the context of preclinical experimental approaches for studying mechanisms of action of serotonergic psychedelics, classic and new."

The studies by George et al. and Ochs-Ross et al. are the only two placebo-controlled, doubleblinded, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of using ketamine for treatment-resistant depression in the geriatric population. Unlike the case reports that preceded them, these studies assessed the benefits of a dose titration strategy rather than a fixed dose, shared a more homogenous patient profile, and standardized the timing of the intervention in relation to the patient’s course of illness. In addition to tracking patient response to the acute phase of ketamine delivery, both studies assessed how the frequency and duration of treatment affected a patient’s time to relapse and tolerability to treatment, which may offer clues for developing future maintenance protocols. The RCTs demonstrated an attenuation of symptom improvement with an overall sustained reduction of Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores with repeated ketamine dosing that were not seen in the earlier case reports. Key differences in subject profile were noted between the case reports and RCTs and therefore may have contributed to the variance of these results.

"8305","1","The acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine on driving: a simulator study.^
OBJECTIVES: Illicit drugs such as MDMA and methamphetamine are commonly abused drugs that have also been observed to be prevalent in drivers injured in road accidents. Their exact effect on driving and driving behavior has yet to be thoroughly investigated. METHODS: Sixty-one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample, with 33 females and 28 males, mean age 25.45 years. The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA, 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine, or a matching placebo. The drug administration was counter-balanced, double-blind, and medically supervised. At each session driving performance was assessed 3 h and 24 h post drug administration on a computerized driving simulator. RESULTS: At peak concentration overall impairment scores for driving (F(2,118)=9.042, p<0.001) and signaling (F(2,118)=4.060, p=0.020) were significantly different for the daytime simulations. Performance in the MDMA condition was worse than both the methamphetamine (p=0.023) and placebo (p<0.001) conditions and the methamphetamine condition was also observed to be worse in comparison to the placebo (p=0.055). For signaling adherence, poorer signaling adherence occurred in both the methamphetamine (p=0.006) and MDMA (p=0.017) conditions in comparison to placebo in the daytime simulations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study have for the first time illustrated how both MDMA and methamphetamine effect driving performance, and provide support for legislation regarding testing for the presence of illicit drugs in impaired or injured drivers as deterrents for driving under the influence of illicit drugs."
"5911","0","Dextromethorphan/quinidine combination as a novel pharmacotherapeutic approach in patients with treatment resistant depression: a proof of concept clinical trial.^
Background: Currently available treatments for major depressive disorder (MDD) are only partially effective, with one third of patients not achieving adequate symptom control. For this group of patients suffering from treatmentresistant depression (TRD), novel treatments that act through non‐monoaminergic mechanisms are urgently needed. Notably, prior studies have demonstrated that the glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine displays rapid‐acting and robust antidepressant effects, even in patients suffering from TRD. In the current study we endeavored to examine the effects of a combination of dextromethorphan (DM) and the CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor quinidine (Q) in patients with TRD. Dextromethorphan modulates signaling at the NMDA receptor, in addition to other pharmacodynamics properties that include activity at sigma‐1 receptors and at the serotonin transporter. Quinidine inhibits the hepatic metabolism of DM, thereby increasing circulating concentrations of the latter. A combination product of DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg given every 12 hours is approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). In the current study, we tested the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Methods: The current study consisted of an open‐label proof of concept (POC) clinical trial of DM/Q for up to 10 weeks in patients with unipolar TRD, either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy. Patients initiated study drug at 20/10 mg daily for 7 days, then increased to 20/10 mg every 12 hours for 7 days, then increased to a maximum dose of 45/10 mg every 12 hours if tolerated. The minimum required dose to remain in the study was 20/10 mg every 12 hours. Eligibility criteria included men and women between the ages of 18 and 65, a primary diagnosis of MDD as determined by the SCID, and a history of non‐response to two or more prior adequate antidepressant trials as determined by Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATFH) criteria. Safety and tolerability outcomes were assessed by discontinuation rate, frequency of adverse events [using the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE)], and score change on the Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‐SSRS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Positive Subscale (BPRS+), and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Efficacy was assessed as change in MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Additional efficacy and functional measures included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology‐Self Report (QIDS‐SR), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). All analyses were conducted on the intention to treat (ITT) sample, with last observation carried forward for missing data. Results: Twenty patients with TRD (11 women; mean age: 49.4 ± 7.7 years) were started on DM/Q therapy and represent the ITT sample. Six patients discontinued prior to study completion, yielding a completer sample of 14 patients (70% retention). The most common adverse events were nausea and constipation, which each occurred in 3 patients. One serious adverse event occurred, representing hospitalization for insomnia and worsening depression three days after starting the study medication; this event was considered unlikely to be related to the study medication. There was no treatment‐emergent suicidal ideation or changes in BPRS+ or CADSS score. MADRS score was reduced from baseline to the 10‐week primary outcome (mean change: 12.95 ± 11.52, t(df = 19) = 5.04, po.001), as was QIDS‐SR score (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). The overall response rate was 45% (as defined by a 50% decrease in MADRS score from baseline to primary outcome). HAM‐A score was reduced from baseline to primary outcome (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). Disability lessened from baseline to primary outcome as measured by the SDS (po.001). Conclusions: Herein we report acceptable tolerability and safety and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg administered every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Future larger placebo controlled randomized trials in this population are warranted."

"7484","1","Rapid and sustained symptom reduction following psilocybin treatment for anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer: a randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

BACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment."
"8327","1","Set and Setting: A Randomized Study of Different Musical Genres in Supporting Psychedelic Therapy.^
Mounting evidence supports the serotonin 2A receptor agonist psilocybin as a psychiatric pharmacotherapy. Little research has experimentally examined how session ""set and setting"" impacts subjective and therapeutic effects. We analyzed the effects of the musical genre played during sessions of a psilocybin study for tobacco smoking cessation. Participants (N = 10) received psilocybin (20-30 mg/70 kg) in two sessions, each with a different musical genre (Western classical versus overtone-based), with the order counterbalanced. Participants chose one genre for a third session (30 mg/70 kg). Mystical experiences scores tended to be higher in overtone-based sessions than in Western classical sessions. Six of ten participants chose the overtone-based music for a third session. Biologically confirmed smoking abstinence was similar based on musical choice, with a slight benefit for participants choosing the overtone-based playlist (66.7% versus 50%). These data call into question whether Western classical music typically used in psychedelic therapy holds a unique benefit. Broadly, we call for experimentally examining session components toward optimizing psychedelic therapeutic protocols."

BACKGROUND: This study evaluated the dose-related ethanol-like subjective effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine hydrochloride in recently detoxified alcoholics. METHODS: Twenty male inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence and who had not consumed alcohol for 10 to 27 days prior to the study completed 3 test days that involved the intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg) or saline solution under randomized double-blind conditions. Ethanol-like subjective effects were assessed using the Sensation Scale; the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale; visual analog scales to measure ""high"" and degree of similarity to ethanol, cocaine, and marijuana; a scale assessing the number of standard alcohol drinks producing similar subjective effects; and visual analog scales measuring ethanol craving. RESULTS: Ketamine produced dose-related ethanol-like effects on each scale measuring its similarity to ethanol. Its effects were more similar to the sedative or descending limb effects of ethanol than to the stimulant or ascending limb effects. Ketamine effects also were more like ethanol than marijuana or cocaine. Ethanol-like effects were more prominent at the higher ketamine dose, a dose rated as similar to greater levels of ethanol intoxication. However, ketamine did not increase craving for ethanol. CONCLUSION: The production of ethanol-like subjective effects by ketamine supports the potential clinical importance of NMDA receptor antagonism among the mechanisms underlying the subjective effects of ethanol in humans."
"5742","0","Later is not necessarily better: limitations of survival analysis in studies of long-term drug treatment of psychiatric conditions.^
Survival analysis is routinely used to assess differences between groups in relapse prevention and treatment discontinuation studies involving people with long-term psychiatric conditions. The actual outcome in survival analysis is 'time to event', yet, in the mental health field, there has been little consideration of whether a temporary delay to relapse is clinically relevant in a condition that can last for decades. Moreover, in psychiatric drug trials, a pattern of elevated early relapses following randomisation to placebo or no treatment is common. This may be the result of the withdrawal of previous treatment leading to physiological withdrawal effects, which may be mistaken for relapse, or genuine relapse precipitated by the process of withdrawal. Such withdrawal effects typically produce converging survival curves eventually. They inevitably lead to differences in time to relapse, even when there is little or no difference in the cumulative risk of relapse at final follow-up. Therefore, statistical tests based on survival analyses can be misleading because they obscure these withdrawal effects. We illustrate these difficulties in a trial of antipsychotic reduction versus maintenance, and a trial of prophylactic esketamine in people with treatment-resistant depression. Both illustrate withdrawal-related effects that underline the importance of long-term follow-up and question the use of tests based on time to event. Further discussion of the most relevant outcome and appropriate approach to analysis, and research on patient and carer preferences is important to inform the design of future trials and interpretation of existing ones."
"5032","1","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

Rationale: Specific cannabis products may differentially increase risk of initiating non-cannabis illicit drug use during adolescence. Objective: To determine whether ever- and poly-use of smoked, vaporized, edible, concentrate, or blunt cannabis products are associated with subsequent initiation of non-cannabis illicit drug use. Methods: High school students from Los Angeles completed in-classroom surveys. The analytic sample (N = 2163; 53.9% female; 43.5% Hispanic/Latino; baseline M age = 17.1 years) included students who reported never using illicit drugs at baseline (spring, 11th grade) and provided data at follow-up (fall and spring, 12th grade). Logistic regression models assessed associations between use of smoked, vaporized, edible, concentrate, and blunt cannabis at baseline (yes/no for each product) and any non-cannabis illicit drug use initiation—including cocaine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, ecstasy, heroin, prescription opioids, or benzodiazepines—at follow-up. Results: Among those who never used non-cannabis illicit drugs at baseline, ever cannabis use varied by cannabis product (smoked = 25.8%, edible = 17.5%, vaporized = 8.4%, concentrates = 3.9%, and blunts = 18.2%) and patterns of use (single product use = 8.2% and poly-product use = 21.8%). After adjustment for baseline covariates, odds of illicit drug use at follow-up were largest for baseline ever users of concentrates (aOR [95% CI] = 5.74[3.16–10.43]), followed by vaporized (aOR [95% CI] = 3.11 [2.41–4.01]), edibles (aOR [95% CI] = 3.43 [2.32–5.08]), blunts (aOR [95% CI] = 2.66[1.60–4.41]), and smoked (aOR [95% CI] = 2.57 [1.64–4.02]) cannabis. Ever use of a single product (aOR [95% CI] = 2.34 [1.26–4.34]) or 2 + products (aOR [95% CI] = 3.82 [2.73–5.35]) were also associated with greater odds of illicit drug initiation.

"9003","0","Adolescent substance use behavior and suicidal behavior for boys and girls: a cross-sectional study by latent analysis approach.^
BACKGROUND: Adolescent suicidal behavior may consist of different symptoms, including suicidal ideation, suicidal planning and suicidal attempts. Adolescent substance use behavior may contribute to adolescent suicidal behavior. However, research on the relationships between specific substance use and individual suicidal behavior is insufficient, as adolescents may not use only one substance or develop only one facet of suicidal behavior. Latent variables permit us to describe the relationships between clusters of related behaviors more accurately than studying the relationships between specific behaviors. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore how adolescent substance use behavior contributes to suicidal behavior using latent variables representing adolescent suicidal and substance use behaviors. METHOD: A total of 13,985 adolescents were recruited using a stratified random sampling strategy. The participants indicated whether they had experienced suicidal ideation, planning and attempts and reported their cigarette, alcohol, ketamine and MDMA use during the past year. Latent analysis was used to examine the relationship between substance use and suicidal behavior. RESULTS: Adolescents who used any one of the above substances exhibited more suicidal behavior. The results of latent variables analysis revealed that adolescent substance use contributed to suicidal behavior and that boys exhibited more severe substance use behavior than girls. However, there was no gender difference in the association between substance use and suicidal behavior. CONCLUSION: Substance use behavior in adolescents is related to more suicidal behavior. In addition, the contribution of substance use to suicidal behavior does not differ between genders."

BACKGROUND: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone. OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at ≥12 months after psilocybin administration. METHODS: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at ≥12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. RESULTS: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (≥16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of substance use disorders is warranted."
"3374","1","Perspectives on psychedelic treatment and research in eating disorders: A web-based questionnaire study of people with eating disorders.^
Approximately 1.25 million people in the UK suffer from an eating disorder, yet the treatment options show limited efficacy, warranting the need for novel approaches. This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of people with eating disorders on the use of complementary therapies and psychedelic research and treatment. Two hundred participants with eating disorders took part in this web survey study. The majority of participants (70%) had used a complementary treatment to manage their eating disorder. Participants believed that psychedelic research was worthwhile in the context of a moderate level of concern. The most popular solutions to meet these concerns included providing education around psychedelics and their effects and use in psychiatry and experiencing endorsement from professionals in the area. Moreover, participant responses emphasized the need for a safe, monitored environment and the patient-therapist rapport in the context of psychedelic treatment. The findings are explored concerning future trials of psychedelics as a treatment for eating disorders."
"6432","1","Ecstasy use and its association with sexual behaviors among drug users in New York City.^
In the past two decades, recreational use of ecstasy has become a growing concern in the United States, although most studies assessing ecstasy use have focused on white, middle-class adolescents who use ecstasy during raves and in clubs. We assessed the prevalence of recent ecstasy use among predominantly minority heroin, cocaine, and crack users in New York City and the association between ecstasy and sexual risk above and beyond that of the other drugs. Between 2002 and 2004, injection and non-injection heroin, crack and cocaine users (N = 534) completed a risk behavior questionnaire that included items on ecstasy use. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relation between current ecstasy use and sexual behaviors. Of 534 illicit drug users, 69.7% were aged 25 years or older, 65.2% were Hispanic, 27.9% Black and 77.4% male; 36.7% were injectors. 17.2% of respondents reported recent (last six months) ecstasy use. In a multivariable logistic regression model, current ecstasy use was associated both with initiating sex before age 14 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.51) and having two or more partners in the past two months (AOR = 1.86) after adjusting for age at study entry, current cocaine and marijuana use and being an injection drug user. This study suggests that ecstasy use may be more prevalent among urban drug users. Ecstasy use in urban settings, beyond clubs and raves, should continue to be monitored. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."
"1457","0","Molecular mechanisms of rapid-acting antidepressants: New perspectives for developing antidepressants.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic relapsing psychiatric disorder. Conventional antidepressants usually require several weeks of continuous administration to exert clinically significant therapeutic effects, while about two-thirds of the patients are prone to relapse of symptoms or are completely ineffective in antidepressant treatment. The recent success of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant has propelled extensive research on the action mechanism of antidepressants, especially in relation to its role in synaptic targets. Studies have revealed that the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine is not limited to antagonism of postsynaptic NMDA receptors or GABA interneurons. Ketamine produces powerful and rapid antidepressant effects by affecting α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors, adenosine A1 receptors, and the L-type calcium channels, among others in the synapse. More interestingly, the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin has demonstrated potential for rapid antidepressant effects in depressed mouse models and clinical studies. This article focuses on a review of new pharmacological target studies of emerging rapid-acting antidepressant drugs such as ketamine and hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin) and briefly discusses the possible strategies for new targets of antidepressants, with a view to shed light on the direction of future antidepressant research."
"7779","1","Increased intensity of Ecstasy and polydrug usage in the more experienced recreational Ecstasy/MDMA users: A WWW study.^
Recreational Ecstasy/MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users often take a variety of psychoactive drugs, but there is little empirical data on how these drug consumption patterns change with greater experience of Ecstasy. The aim of this study was to compare the polydrug usage patterns reported by non-Ecstasy users, novice Ecstasy users, moderate Ecstasy users, and heavy Ecstasy users. In a WWW study of 763 unpaid volunteers, 481 had never taken Ecstasy, whereas 282 reported they had taken it. The Ecstasy users comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate Ecstasy users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy Ecstasy users (+100 occasions). Each participant also reported their experience with a range of other psychoactive drugs. The Ecstasy users reported significantly greater psychoactive drug usage than the non-Ecstasy users. The novice, moderate, and heavy Ecstasy users also differed significantly from each other in the use of cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms, but not of alcohol, cannabis, or cigarettes/nicotine. Experienced Ecstasy users also took significantly more MDMA tablets on each occasion, and reported a higher maximum weekly intake. The increased use of Ecstasy is associated with more intensive patterns of Ecstasy/MDMA intake, and the greater use of illicit CNS stimulants and hallucinogens, but not of alcohol, nicotine, or cannabis. These results are discussed in the context of cross-tolerance and drug predisposition/preference. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"5464","1","Serotonin neurotoxicity after (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy""): a controlled study in humans.^
(+/-)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""Ecstasy""), an increasingly popular recreational drug, is known to damage brain serotonin 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) neurons in experimental animals. Whether MDMA is neurotoxic in humans has not been established. Thirty MDMA users and 28 controls were admitted to a controlled inpatient setting for measurement of biologic and behavioral indexes of central 5-HT function. Outcome measures obtained after at least 2 weeks of drug abstinence included concentrations of monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), prolactin responses to L-tryptophan, nociceptive responses to ischemic pain, and personality characteristics in which 5-HT has been implicated (i.e., impulsivity and aggression). Subjects with a history of MDMA exposure had lower levels of CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the major metabolite of 5-HT) than controls (p = .001). Although they resembled controls in their prolactin response to L-tryptophan and their response to ischemic pain, MDMA users had lower scores on personality measures of impulsivity (p = .004) and indirect hostility (p = .009). The CSF findings suggest that 5-HT neurotoxicity may be a potential complication of MDMA use. Further, differences in personality support the view that 5-HT systems are involved in modulating impulsive and aggressive personality traits. Additional studies of MDMA-exposed individuals are needed to confirm and extend the present findings. Such studies could help elucidate the role of 5-HT in normal brain function as well as in neuropsychiatric disease states."
"3555","1","The effects of ketamine on symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world care settings: A retrospective controlled analysis.^
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine intravenous therapy (KIT) appears effective for treating depression in controlled trials testing a short series of infusions. A rapidly proliferating number of clinics offer KIT for depression and anxiety, using protocols without a strong evidence basis. Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017-03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies. RESULTS: Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d = -1.17 and d = -1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d = -1.03 and d = -0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal. LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses, interpreting this dataset is limited by incomplete patient information and sample attrition. CONCLUSIONS: KIT treatment elicited robust symptomatic relief that remained stable up to one year of follow-up."
"800","1","Preliminary Report on the Effects of a Low Dose of LSD on Resting-State Amygdala Functional Connectivity.^
BACKGROUND: The practice of ""microdosing,"" or the use of repeated, very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to improve mood or cognition, has received considerable public attention, but empirical studies are lacking. Controlled studies are needed to investigate both the therapeutic potential and the neurobiological underpinnings of this pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: The present study was designed to examine the effects of a single low dose of LSD (13 μg) versus placebo on resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in healthy young adults. Twenty men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions in which they received placebo or LSD under double-blind conditions. During each session, the participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, they underwent resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent and arterial spin labeling scans. Cerebral blood flow as well as amygdala and thalamic connectivity were analyzed. RESULTS: LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. This low dose of LSD had weak and variable effects on mood, but its effects on positive mood were positively correlated with the increase in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings show that a very low dose of LSD, which produces negligible subjective changes, alters brain connectivity in limbic circuits. Additional studies, especially with repeated dosing, will reveal whether these neural changes are related to the drug's purported antidepressant effect."
"7062","1","The effect of 5-HT2A/1A agonist treatment on social cognition, empathy, and social decision making.^
Social cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5HT‐1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5HT‐1A/2A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. In a double‐blind, randomized, cross‐over design we therefore investigated the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in healthy volunteers using fMRI. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. The neural response to social exclusion in the ACC ‐ a brain region associated with 'social pain'‐ was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo. Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin while no significant differences were found in cognitive empathy. These results show that the 5HT‐1A/2A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio‐cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients."
"6779","0","Cannabis-induced psychotic disorders.^
Cannabis, and more specifically THC, has been proven, through clinical observation and laboratory confirmation, to cause psychiatric symptoms as a result of intoxication and withdrawal. These transient effects include positive and negative psychotic symptoms. In clinical settings, the official nosological system identifies this entity as cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. Epidemiologic studies found an incidence for this disorder of about 2.7 per 100,000 person years. Rate of conversion to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders ranges between 44.5% and 46% in 5–8 years of follow-up. Diagnostic tools to identify cannabis-induced psychotic disorder have limited reliability, especially if used outside of research settings with highly trained interviewers. Since the literature on this topic is so conflicting with regard to nosology, this chapter will focus on Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder, as described in the DSM-5, which can be described as an acute, transient, self limited psychotic reaction during cannabis intoxication or withdrawal in the absence of a primary psychotic disorder. Laboratory evidence for this disorder has been collected through the past decade. D'Souza et al. designed an experiment to characterize the dose-related psychotomimetic effects of THC, in healthy individuals under double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory conditions, using standardized behavioral and cognitive assessments. The group found that intravenous injection of THC produced transient effects including positive symptoms (suspiciousness, paranoid and grandiose delusions, conceptual disorganization, and illusions); negative symptoms (blunted affect, reduced rapport, lack of spontaneity, psychomotor retardation, and emotional withdrawal); perceptual alterations; euphoria; anxiety; and deficits in working memory, recall, and attention, without altering general orientation. Similar effects have been replicated in several studies from different research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"3104","1","Neurometabolic effects of psilocybin, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE) and d-methamphetamine in healthy volunteers. A double-blind, placebo-controlled PET study with [18F]FDG.^
The neurometabolic effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin (PSI; 0.2 mg/kg), the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE; 2 mg/kg) and the stimulant d-methamphetamine (METH; 0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and the drugs' interactions with a prefrontal activation task were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucoseFDG-positron emission tomographicPET study (each group: n = 8). Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand. The MDE data support the hypothesis that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class, which takes an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens."
"4938","1","Social determinants and distance from certified treatment centers are associated with initiation of esketamine nasal spray among patients with challenging-to-treat major depressive disorder.^
Indicated for treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation, esketamine (ESK) is self-administered under supervision at certified treatment centers. Our study was to determine if social determinants of health and distance were associated with ESK utilization. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 308 US adults initiating ESK between October 11, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and 1540 propensity-score matched controls with treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation. Adjusting for demographics, prior health care utilization and comorbidities, social determinant variables and distance were regressed separately on each outcome: ESK initiation, failure to complete induction (8 treatments in 45 days), and discontinuation within 6 months. ESK initiation was associated with higher population density (odds ratio [OR]: 2.12), American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander (OR: 3.19), and mental health (OR: 1.55) and primary care providers (OR: 1.55) per capita. Lower likelihood of ESK initiation was associated with living > 7.2 miles from a treatment center (OR: 0.75), living in rural areas (OR: 0.64), and percent non-Hispanic African American (OR: 0.58) and Hispanic (OR: 0.40). Health care providers should tailor patient engagement strategies to mitigate potential barriers to initiating and continuing appropriate treatment. Failing to complete induction was associated with substance use disorder and longer distance to treatment center was associated with discontinuation (hazard ratio: 1.48), as was percent Asian population (hazard ratio: 1.37). Prior psychiatric care and residence in counties with high rates of primary care providers per capita, unemployment, and high school graduation were associated with both higher likelihood of completing induction and lower likelihood of discontinuation."
"6325","1","Ketamine and Other NMDA Antagonists: Early Clinical Trials and Possible Mechanisms in Depression.^
OBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution."
"2114","1","Ketamine for acute suicidal ideation. An emergency department intervention: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial.^
BACKGROUND: Depressed patients presenting to emergency departments with acute suicidal ideation are a major public health concern. Ketamine, a rapidly acting antidepressant with antisuicidal properties, might offer relief. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial, 18 depressed subjects with acute suicidal ideation, who required hospitalization, were randomized to either an intravenous ketamine 0.2 mg/kg group or a saline placebo group. Safety and efficacy evaluations were scheduled for 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, and on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 after infusion. The main outcome measure was suicidal ideation with secondary measures of depression. RESULTS: Nine subjects were randomized to each group. There were no differences between groups at baseline in any demographic or assessment scales. A reduction in suicidal ideation was noted at 90-180 min (p < .05). Ninety minutes after infusion, 88% of the ketamine group had achieved remission of suicidal ideation compared with 33% in the placebo group (p < .05). No serious adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine was safe and effective for rapid reduction in suicidal ideation in depressed, highly suicidal subjects presenting to the emergency department. Our results support further study of ketamine for acute suicidal ideation."
"5048","1","Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine: Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p < 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD. LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: After six ketamine infusions, neurocognitive improvement was observed in patients with anxious TRD but not in patients with nonanxious TRD."
"6470","1","Distinct trajectories of antidepressant response to intravenous ketamine.^
BACKGROUND: The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine is potentially effective in treatment resistant depression. However, its antidepressant efficacy is highly variable, and there is little information about predictors of response. METHODS: We employed growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis to examine specific response trajectories to intravenous (IV) ketamine (three infusions; mean dose 0.63 mg/kg, SD 0.28, range 0.30 - 2.98 mg/kg over 40 min) in 328 depressed adult outpatients referred to a community clinic. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) assessed depression severity at baseline and before each infusion, up to three infusions for four total observations. RESULTS: GMM revealed three QIDS-SR response trajectories. There were two groups of severely depressed patients, with contrasting responses to ketamine. One group (n=135, baseline QIDS-SR=18.8) had a robust antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=7.3); the other group (n=97, QIDS-SR=19.8) was less responsive (final QIDS-SR=15.6). A third group (n=96) was less severely depressed at baseline (QIDS-SR=11.7), with intermediate antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=6.6). Comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between groups with severe baseline depression revealed higher childhood physical abuse in the group with robust ketamine response (p=0.01). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective analysis on a naturalistic sample. Patients were unblinded and more heterogenous than those included in most controlled clinical trial samples. Information pertaining to traumatic events occurring after childhood and pre-existing or concurrent medical conditions that may have affected outcomes was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ketamine's effect in patients with severe baseline depression and history of childhood maltreatment may be consistent with ketamine-induced blockade of behavioral sensitization."
"1886","1","Modulation of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor by a Single Dose of Ayahuasca: Observation From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^
Serotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant. This trial is registered at http://clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02914769)."
"9038","1","Visuo-spatial working memory deficits in current and former users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^
Verbal working memory and executive deficits have been observed in ecstasy users. The present study sought to establish whether these also extended to visuo-spatial working memory. Thirty-six current ecstasy users, 12 former users (abstinent for at least 6 months) and 31 individuals that had never used ecstasy were tested on a maintenance plus type visuo-spatial working memory task. The task required participants to recall a sequence of specially marked cells in a four-by-four matrix display while at the same time performing a concurrent visual judgement task. Both the current and former user groups registered impairments relative to nonusers. These remained significant following statistical controls for a range of potentially confounding variables including the use of various other drugs during the 3 months prior to testing. Users were unimpaired on a simple spatial span measure suggesting that the deficits observed reflected the executive aspects of the spatial working memory task. Also consistent with executive involvement, statistical controls for measures of verbal working memory performance (computation span) removed half of the ecstasy-related variance in spatial working memory. The possibility that the pattern of results obtained might reflect some general impairment in information processing efficiency is discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"4049","1","Discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans trained to discriminate among d-amphetamine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and placebo.^
In animals, two-choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In order to delineate the relative role of these systems, three-choice paradigms have been used in animals, with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin. Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action. To parallel animal studies, the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist, d-amphetamine, a prototypic serotonergic agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA. In addition, subjective and physiological effects were measured. The results demonstrated that humans could be trained to discriminate among 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and placebo. When tested with 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, half the participants reported MDMA to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP. There were no clear differences between these two groups in other dimensions, although there was an indication that the individuals who discriminated MDMA as d-amphetamine were more sensitive to the effects of all the drugs. The subjective effects of all three drugs overlapped, although the effects of MDMA appeared more amphetamine-like."
"1724","0","First drug-checking study at an electronic festival and fentanyl detection in the central region of Mexico.^
Background: Perception of drug adulteration has increased in Mexico, but there is little research on adulterants and toxicity. The aim of this study was to identify drug composition in an electronic music outdoor festival nearby Mexico City. Methods: The participants completed a questionnaire with demographic data, harm reduction strategies, drug-use patterns, history, and the drug they expected to find. We took a small sample of each substance and prepared it for drug checking. A two-section drug testing station was placed within the grounds of the festival. Interaction with participants occurred at the front part. Drug checking was conducted at the rear part. The service was free of charge, voluntary and confidential. Forty persons aged 22 to 48 years participated (mode = 28), of which 92.5% were male, most (82.5%) were single. Through the Substance Analysis Program of “ReverdeSer Collective,” we conducted the testing with the attendants that provided 51 drug samples, following ethical and biosafety protocols. We used colorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and fentanyl immunoassay strips for sample analysis. Results: Substances of choice among attendants were psychostimulants (MDMA and other amphetamine-like drugs) and hallucinogens. Most samples contained what the users expected plus adulterants. Main adulterants were methylene-dioxy-ethyl-amphetamine, methylene-dioxy-propyl-amphetamine, hydroxyamphetamine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Fentanyl was present in 2 out of 4 cocaine samples and in 14 of the 22 confirmed MDMA samples. Conclusions: Some of the adulterants found pose serious health risks, especially fentanyl, amphetamine-like substances, and venlafaxine. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor these adulterants at electronic music festivals and to implement prevention, treatment, and harm reduction public policies. Naloxone distribution and drug-assisted therapies should be part of government programs in Mexico."

BACKGROUND: Orthopedic reductions are commonly performed procedures requiring sedation in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Ketamine is a widely used agent for pediatric procedural sedation, but its use may present difficulties in select populations, such as those with psychiatric diagnoses. In such a case, alternative agents that are safe and effective are needed. Etomidate is a commonly used induction agent for rapid-sequence intubation in the PED. Several retrospective and few prospective studies support etomidate's safety and efficacy in pediatric procedural sedation. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare etomidate/fentanyl (E/F) with ketamine/midazolam (K/M) for procedural sedation during orthopedic reductions in the PED. METHODS: Prospective, partially blinded, randomized controlled study comparing intravenously administered K/M with intravenously administered E/F. A convenience sample of patients, aged 5 to 18 years, presenting to an urban PED with fracture requiring reduction was enrolled. Outcome measures included guardian and staff completion of visual analog scale and Likert scales for observed pain and satisfaction, blinded OSBD-r (Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised) scoring of digital recordings of reductions, and sedation and recovery times. Descriptive tracking of adverse effects, adverse events, and interventions were recorded at the sedation. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 11 in the K/M group and 12 in the E/F group. The K/M group had significantly lower mean OSBD-r scores compared with the E/F group (0.08 vs 0.89, P = 0.001). Parents rated lower visual analog scale scores with K/M than with E/F (13.7 vs 50.5, P = 0.003) and favored K/M on a 5-point satisfaction scale (P = 0.004). The E/F group had significantly shorter total sedation times (49.6 vs 77.6 minutes, P = 0.003) and recovery times (24.7 vs 61.4 minutes, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences with respect to procedural amnesia and orthopedic practitioner satisfaction. Adverse effects noted in the K/M group included dysphoric emergence reaction and vomiting. Vomiting, injection-site pain, myoclonus, airway readjustment, and supplemental oxygen use were observed in the E/F group. CONCLUSIONS: This is a small study that strongly suggests that, for pediatric orthopedic reductions, K/M is more effective at reducing observed distress than E/F, although both provide equal procedural amnesia. With its significantly shorter sedation and recovery times, E/F may be more applicable for procedural sedation for shorter, simpler procedures in the PED."
"4453","1","Two-dimensional gas chromatography/electron-impact mass spectrometry with cryofocusing for simultaneous quantification of MDMA, MDA, HMMA, HMA, and MDEA in human plasma.^
BACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug. Analysis of MDMA and metabolites in human plasma, particularly in pharmacokinetic studies, requires low limits of quantification. Two-dimensional GC/MS with cryofocusing is a chromatographic technique recognized for its increased selectivity and resolution. METHODS: This method simultaneously quantifies 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), MDMA, and its metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3- methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) in human plasma. With hydrochloric acid, we hydrolyzed 1 mL plasma, fortified with internal standard. Analytes were subjected to solidphase extraction, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride, and quantified using cryofocused 2-dimensional GC/MS operated in electron-impact selected ion-monitoring mode. RESULTS: Limits of quantification were 1.0 μg/L for MDA and 2.5 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, HMMA, and HMA. Calibration curves were linear to 100 μg/L for MDA and HMA and to 400 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, and HMMA, with r2 > 0.997. At 3 concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range of the assay, mean overall extraction efficiencies from plasma were ≥85% for all compounds of interest. Recoveries were 85.6% to 107.2% of target, and intra- and interassay imprecision (CV) was <8.5% for all drugs at 3 concentrations within the range of the assay. None of the 66 exogenous compounds tested interfered with analyte quantification. CONCLUSIONS: This GC/MS assay provides low limits of quantification for simultaneous determination of MDEA, MDMA, and metabolites MDA, HMMA, and HMA in human plasma. The 2D chromatographic system should be suitable for application to other analytes and to other complex matrices. © 2007 American Association for Clinical Chemistry."
"8687","1","The Effects of Ketamine on Cognition in Unipolar and Bipolar Depression: A Systematic Review.^
Objective: To determine the objective neurocognitive effects of (1) single-dose ketamine, (2) repeated-dose ketamine, (3) ketamine adjunct to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and (4) ketamine as the anesthetic for ECT in major depressive disorder (MDD) and depression in bipolar disorder (BD). Data Sources: Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched on March 19, 2020 (updated July 2, 2020), using the terms terms major depressive disorder bipolar disorder and ketamine and their synonyms. Clinical trial registries (search date May 4, 2020) and reference sections of included articles were also searched. There was no restriction on language or year of publication. Study Selection: Of 4,035 identified articles, 17 met inclusion criteria. Controlled and open-label studies of adults who received at least 1 ketamine treatment for a current major depressive episode, as part of MDD or BD, were included. Only studies measuring cognition using at least 1 validated, objective neurocognitive assessment were eligible. Data Extraction: Results are presented using a narrative review format. Data regarding change in cognitive performance from baseline to end-of-treatment and/or differences in cognition between ketamine and control groups were extracted. Results: There were no negative effects of single- or repeated-dose intravenous ketamine up to 2 weeks post-treatment in MDD. Limited data were available for BD populations, as well as on other routes of ketamine administration. Conclusions: Data to definitively answer the question of whether ketamine has substantive or persistent cognitive effects are insufficient; thus, larger controlled trials measuring cognition as the primary outcome are needed. Future research should focus on different routes of ketamine administration, ketamine enantiomers, and BD populations."
"1358","1","Results of an international drug testing service for cryptomarket users.^
Introduction: User surveys indicate that expectations of higher drug purity are a key reason for cryptomarket use. In 2014-2015, Spain's NGO Energy Control conducted a 1 -year pilot project to provide a testing service to cryptomarket drug users using the Transnational European Drug Information (TEDI) guidelines. In this paper, we present content and purity data from the trial. Methods: 219 samples were analyzed by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Users were asked to report what substance they allegedly purchased. Results: 40 different advertised substances were reported, although 77.6% were common recreational drugs (cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, LSD, ketamine, cannabis). In 200 samples (91.3%), the main result of analysis matched the advertised substance. Where the advertised compound was detected, purity levels (m +/- SD) were: cocaine 71.6 +/- 19.4%; MDMA (crystal) 88.3 +/- 1.4%; MDMA (pills) 133.3 +/- 38.4 mg; Amphetamine (speed) 51.3 +/- 33.9%; LSD 123.6 +/- 40.5 mu g; Cannabis resin THC: 16.5 +/- 7.5% CBD: 3.4 +/- 1.5%; Ketamine 71.3 +/- 38.4%. 39.8% of cocaine samples contained the adulterant levamisole (11.6 +/- 8%). No adulterants were found in MDMA and LSD samples. Discussion: The largest collection of test results from drug samples delivered from cryptomarkets are reported in this study. Most substances contained the advertised ingredient and most samples were of high purity. The representativeness of these results is unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"5046","1","Effects of intra-operative administration of subanesthetic s-ketamine on emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is administered in the perioperative period for its benefits in analgesia, anti-agitation and anti-depression when administered at a small dose. However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026). EEG patterns did not differ during the recovery period after emergence between groups. CONCLUSION: Ketamine administered during sevoflurane anesthesia had no apparent influence on emergence time in young and middle-aged female patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Subanesthetic s-ketamine induced an active prefrontal EEG pattern during sevoflurane anesthesia but did not raise neurological side effects after surgery.

"8830","0","The PMMA epidemic in Norway: Comparison of fatal and non-fatal intoxications.^
During a 6 month period (July 2010-January 2011) we observed 12 fatal intoxications and 22 non-fatal cases related to the drug paramethoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) in Norway (4.8 mill inhabitants). This toxic designer drug, also known as "" Death"" , is occasionally found in street drugs offered as "" ecstasy"" or "" amphetamine"" The present study aimed to evaluate the cause of death, and to compare the PMMA blood concentrations in fatal and non-fatal cases. Methods for identification and quantification of PMMA are presented. The median age of fatalities was 30 years (range 15-50) with 67% males; in non-fatal cases 27 years (20-47) with 86% males. In the 12 fatalities, the median PMMA blood concentration was 1.92. mg/L (range 0.17-3.30), which is in the reported lethal range of 0.6-3.1. mg/L in peripheral blood and 1.2-15.8. mg/L in heart blood. In the 22 non-fatal cases, the median PMMA concentration was 0.07. mg/L (range 0.01-0.65). Poly-drug use was frequent both in fatal and non-fatal cases. The PMA concentrations ranging from 0.00 to 0.26. mg/L in both groups likely represented a PMMA metabolite. Three fatalities were attributed to PMMA only, six to PMMA and other psychostimulant drugs, and three to PMMA and CNS depressant drugs, with median PMMA concentrations of 3.05. mg/L (range 1.58-3.30), 2.56 (1.52-3.23) and 0.52. mg/L (0.17-1.24), respectively. Eight victims were found dead, while death was witnessed in four cases, with symptoms of acute respiratory distress, hyperthermia, cardiac arrest, convulsions, sudden collapse and/or multiple organ failure. In summary, all fatalities attributed to PMMA had high PMMA blood concentrations compared to non-fatal cases. Our sample size was too small to evaluate a possible impact of poly-drug use.

"185","1","Effects of ketamine and midazolam on resting state connectivity and comparison with ENIGMA connectivity deficit patterns in schizophrenia.^
Subanesthetic administration of ketamine is a pharmacological model to elicit positive and negative symptoms of psychosis in healthy volunteers. We used resting-state pharmacological functional MRI (rsPhfMRI) to identify cerebral networks affected by ketamine and compared them to the functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia. Ketamine can produce sedation and we contrasted its effects with the effects of the anxiolytic drug midazolam. Thirty healthy male volunteers (age = 19-37 years) underwent a randomized, three-way, cross-over study consisting of three imaging sessions, with 48 hr between sessions. A session consisted of a control period followed by infusion of placebo or ketamine or midazolam. The ENIGMA rsfMRI pipeline was used to derive two long-distance (seed-based and dual-regression) and one local (regional homogeneity, ReHo) FC measures. Ketamine induced significant reductions in the connectivity of the salience network (Cohen's d: 1.13 ± 0.28, p = 4.0 × 10(-3) ), auditory network (d: 0.67 ± 0.26, p = .04) and default mode network (DMN, d: 0.63 ± 0.26, p = .05). Midazolam significantly reduced connectivity in the DMN (d: 0.77 ± 0.27, p = .03). The effect sizes for ketamine for resting networks showed a positive correlation (r = .59, p = .07) with the effect sizes for schizophrenia-related deficits derived from ENIGMA's study of 261 patients and 327 controls. Effect sizes for midazolam were not correlated with the schizophrenia pattern (r = -.17, p = .65). The subtraction of ketamine and midazolam patterns showed a significant positive correlation with the pattern of schizophrenia deficits (r = .68, p = .03). RsPhfMRI reliably detected the shared and divergent pharmacological actions of ketamine and midazolam on cerebral networks. The pattern of disconnectivity produced by ketamine was positively correlated with the pattern of connectivity deficits observed in schizophrenia, suggesting a brain functional basis for previously poorly understood effects of the drug."
"1738","1","Neuropsychological assessment of undergraduate marihuana and LSD users.^
An extended battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to three groups of college seniors (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]/mescaline users; marihuana/hashish users; and controls) who were matched on predrug usage intellectual and personality dimensions. The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references)."
"3653","1","Gamma and delta neural oscillations and association with clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^
Several electrical neural oscillatory abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia, although the underlying mechanisms of these oscillatory problems are unclear. Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies."

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the agonist and antagonist properties of pentazocine, an opioid mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic, in relation to prototypic opioid agonist and antagonist drugs in opioid-dependent human subjects. Pentazocine (45 and 60 mg), naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 mg), morphine (20, 40 and 60 mg) and saline placebo were administered intramuscularly to six male volunteers maintained on methadone (30 mg/24 hr p.o.), following a double-blind, randomized block order design. Drugs were administered 20 hr after the last dose of methadone. Subject-reported effects and physiological measures were collected before drug administration and during 4 hr postadministration. Morphine produced significant dose-related increases in subjective measures characteristic of mu agonist effects, decreased pupil diameter and was classified as an opioid agonist. Naloxone precipitated a dose-related opioid withdrawal syndrome which was measurable on several subject-rated measures, and significantly increased pupil diameter. Subjects consistently identified naloxone as an antagonist. Pentazocine precipitated a withdrawal syndrome, but the effects were not dose-dependent, and produced symptoms of confusion and dysphoric changes that were not observed after naloxone administration. Pentazocine was classified as an antagonist by some individuals, and as alcohol or hallucinogen by others. The results of the present study indicate that pentazocine acts in humans as a partial mu agonist with a non-mu component of activity."
"4070","1","Powerful substances in tiny amounts: An interview study of psychedelic microdosing.^
Aims: This article presents a qualitative interview study of people who microdose with psychedelic drugs, which means that the user takes about one tenth of an ordinary recreational dose. Design: Respondents (n = 21) were recruited at several Internet fora for individual interviews via private messaging. Every participant was male, and the median respondent was in his 30s with a stable job and relationship and extensive entheogen experience. Results: Respondents tended to experiment with microdosing in phases, reporting mostly positive consequences from this form of drug use. Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing. Conclusion: The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning. While the study's findings are not generalisable, they may inform subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses."

RATIONALE: Illicit drug use can increase driver crash risk due to loss of control over vehicle trajectory. This study asks, does recreational use of +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; marijuana) impair cognitive processes that help direct our safe movement through the world? OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the residual effects of combined MDMA/THC use, and of THC use alone, upon perceived trajectory of travel. METHODS: Perception of self-motion, or heading, from optical flow patterns was assessed using stimuli comprising random dot ground planes presented at three different densities and eight heading angles (1, 2, 4 and 8 degrees to the left or right). On each trial, subjects reported if direction of travel was to the left or the right. RESULTS: Results showed impairments in both drug groups, with the MDMA/THC group performing the worst. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that these psychoactive agents adversely affect heading perception, even in recently abstinent users, raises potential concerns about MDMA use and driving ability."

Background Cluster headache (CH) patients often receive unsatisfactory treatment and may explore illicit substances as alternatives. We aimed to explore this use of illicit drugs for CH treatment. Methods We invited CH patients from an Internet-based self-help group to complete a questionnaire regarding their therapeutic use of illicit substances. Results Of the 54 respondents, 29 were classified as chronic and 39 were drug-resistant cases. Fifty patients had previously tried subcutaneous sumatriptan, 40 had tried O2, and 48 had tried at least one prophylactic treatment. All 54 patients specified that they were dissatisfied with conventional treatments. Thirty-four patients had used cannabinoids, 13 cocaine, 8 heroin, 18 psilocybin, 12 lysergic acid amide (LSA), and 4 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Discussion Some patients with intractable CH decided to try illicit drugs concomitantly with cessation of medical care. Most of these patients found suggestions for illicit drug use on the Internet. Many patients seemed to underestimate the judicial consequences of, and had an overestimated confidence in the safety of, such illicit treatments. Physicians are often not informed by patients of their choice to use illicit drugs. This leads to questions regarding the true nature of the physician-patient relationship among dissatisfied CH patients."
"3126","1","Hallucinogen use is associated with mental health and addictive problems and impulsivity in university students.^
Background: This study examined the prevalence of hallucinogen use in a large sample of university students and its associations with mental health issues. Methods: 9449 students received a 156-item anonymous online survey, which assessed the use of hallucinogens (ever or past year), alcohol and drug use, mental health issues, and impulsive and compulsive traits. Group differences were characterized using statistical tests (p values reported uncorrected, but only regarded as significant if surviving Bonferroni correction). Results: 3525 university students (57.7% female) responded to the survey. The prevalence of past 12-month hallucinogen use in the sample was 4.7%, with an additional 6.4% reporting having used more than 12 months ago. Hallucinogen use was associated with the use of multiple other drugs (e.g., alcohol, opiates) (each p < 0.001), mental health problems (p < 0.001), risky sexual behavior (p < 0.001), low self-esteem (p = 0.004), and impulsivity traits (p < 0.001) but not compulsivity. Effect sizes were small to medium. Conclusion: Past use of hallucinogens was reported in 11.1%, and was associated with a variety of mental health and drug use problems. Clinicians should be aware that use of hallucinogens is common and mental health problems are more likely in those who use hallucinogens. This study indicates the need for longitudinal research into the negative effects of hallucinogen use on brain function and mental health, especially in young people. Such research should address the extent to which impulsive traits predispose to various substance use problems, versus the direct effects of hallucinogens (and other substances) on mental health."

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-08995-001[/rid]). Background: Terminally ill patients may experience existential distress, depression, or anxiety, limiting quality of life in the final stage. Existing psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions have (time) limited efficacy. Psychedelic treatment may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option. Aim: Systematically review studies on psychedelic treatment with and without psychotherapy for existential distress, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill patients. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for original-data studies on the treatment of depression, anxiety, and existential distress with classical or a-typical psychedelics in patients with a terminal illness, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: A total of 1850 records were screened, and 33 articles were included in this review: 14 studies on classical psychedelics (DPT, LSD, and psilocybin) and 19 studies on atypical psychedelics (MDMA and ketamine). Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Both classical and a-typical psychedelics are promising treatment options in patients with terminal illness. To draw final conclusions on effectiveness and safety of psychedelics, we need larger high-quality studies for classical psychedelics and MDMA. Ketamine studies should pay more attention to existential dimensions of well-being and the psychotherapeutic context of the treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"

"8970","1","Altered Insula Connectivity under MDMA.^
Recent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to investigate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on large-scale patterns of brain activity. MDMA, a potent monoamine-releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin- releasing properties, has unique subjective effects that include: marked positive mood, pleasant/unusual bodily sensations and pro-social, empathic feelings. However, the neurobiological basis for these effects is not properly understood, and the present analysis sought to address this knowledge gap. To do this, we administered MDMA-HCl (100 mg p.o.) and, separately, placebo (ascorbic acid) in a randomized, double-blind, repeated-measures design with twenty-five healthy volunteers undergoing fMRI scanning. We then employed a measure of global resting-state functional brain connectivity and follow-up seed-to-voxel analysis to the fMRI data we acquired. Results revealed decreased right insula/salience network functional connectivity under MDMA. Furthermore, these decreases in right insula/salience network connectivity correlated with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily sensations under MDMA. The present findings highlight insular disintegration (ie, compromised salience network membership) as a neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience, and relate this brain effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations-both of which are known to be associated with insular functioning."
"3112","1","Adjunctive Ketamine With Relapse Prevention-Based Psychological Therapy in the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder.^
OBJECTIVE: Early evidence suggests that ketamine may be an effective treatment to sustain abstinence from alcohol. The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of ketamine compared with placebo in increasing abstinence in patients with alcohol use disorder. An additional aim was to pilot ketamine combined with mindfulness-based relapse prevention therapy compared with ketamine and alcohol education as a therapy control. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, 96 patients with severe alcohol use disorder were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) three weekly ketamine infusions (0.8 mg/kg i.v. over 40 minutes) plus psychological therapy, 2) three saline infusions plus psychological therapy, 3) three ketamine infusions plus alcohol education, or 4) three saline infusions plus alcohol education. The primary outcomes were self-reported percentage of days abstinent and confirmed alcohol relapse at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants (35 women; mean age, 44.07 years [SD=10.59]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were associated with the study drug. Although confidence intervals were wide, consistent with a proof-of-concept study, there were a significantly greater number of days abstinent from alcohol in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (mean difference=10.1%, 95% CI=1.1, 19.0), with the greatest reduction in the ketamine plus therapy group compared with the saline plus education group (15.9%, 95% CI=3.8, 28.1). There was no significant difference in relapse rate between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that treatment with three infusions of ketamine was well tolerated in patients with alcohol use disorder and was associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol at 6-month follow-up. The findings suggest a possible beneficial effect of adding psychological therapy alongside ketamine treatment."

Subject inclusion criteria included lifetime Ecstasy use exceeding five times and once in the past year, with participants ranging in age between 16 and 47 years of age from St. Louis, Miami, U.S. and Sydney, Australia. A satisfactory model typified four latent classes representing clearly differentiated diagnostic clusters including: (1) a group of sub-threshold users endorsing few abuse and dependence symptoms (negatives), (2) a group of 'diagnostic orphans' who had characteristic features of dependence for a select group of symptoms (mild dependent), (3) a 'transitional group' mimicking the orphans with regard to their profile of dependence also but reporting some abuse symptoms (moderate dependent), and (4) a 'severe dependent' group with a distinct profile of abuse and dependence symptoms. A multinomial logistic regression model indicated that certain latent classes showed unique associations with external non-diagnostic markers. Controlling for demographic characteristics and lifetime quantity of Ecstasy pill use, criminal behavior and motivational cues for Ecstasy use were the most efficient predictors of cluster membership. This study reinforces the heuristic utility of DSM-IV criteria applied to Ecstasy but with a different collage of symptoms that produced four distinct classes of Ecstasy users. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"9224","0","The acute effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors on the stimulus effects of hallucinogens.^
In a previous study it was observed that fluoxetine potentiates the stimulus effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In the present investigation, stimulus control was established in groups of rats using as training drugs the hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); 0.1 mg/kg), (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine [(-)-DOM; 0.56 mg/kg], ibogaine (10 mg/kg), and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT; 3 mg/kg). A two-lever, fixed-ratio 10, positively reinforced task with saline controls was employed. The hypotheses tested were that (a) monoamine uptake inhibitors other than fluoxetine potentiate the discriminative effects of LSD, and (b) hallucinogens other than LSD are potentiated by acute pretreatment with monoamine uptake inhibitors. The effects of a range of doses of each of the training drugs were determined both alone and following pretreatment with the monoamine reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and venlafaxine. In LSD-trained subjects, all three reuptake inhibitors caused a significant increase in LSD-appropriate responding. Similar results were observed in rats trained with (-)-DOM and with ibogaine. In 5-MeO-DMT-trained subjects, only fluoxetine resulted in an enhancement of drug-appropriate responding. The reuptake inhibitors given alone elicited varying degrees of responses appropriate for the respective training drugs. For fluoxetine in rats trained with LSD and ibogaine, for venlafaxine in LSD trained, and for fluvoxamine in (-)-DOM trained, the degree of responding met our criterion for intermediate responding, i.e., significantly different from both training conditions. Subsequent experiments in (-)-DOM-trained subjects examined a range of doses of each of the reuptake inhibitors in combination with a fixed dose of ( -)-DOM (0.1 mg/kg), which alone yielded about 50% (-)-DOM-appropriate responding. With the exception of the point obtained with the highest dose of venlafaxine, all data were compatible with additivity of effects rather than true potentiation. In summary, the present data extend our previous observation of the augmentation of the stimulus effects of LSD by fluoxetine to include other hallucinogens. The mechanisms by which these interactions arise and possible differential effects of acute and chronic treatment remain to be established. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc."

A new gas chromatography-mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous identification and quantitation of amphetamine (AP), methamphetamine (MA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and 3,4-methylenedioxyethamphetamine (MDEA) in hair is proposed. Hair was hydrolyzed in 1M NaOH at 40°C, subjected to extraction with 4:1 (v/v) methylene chloride/isopropanol, and derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) and ethyl acetate. Calibration curves for the five analytes were constructed over the concentration range 0.5-25.0 ng/mg, using their pentadeuterated analogues as internal standards. The limits of detection and quantitation obtained were 0.045 and 0.151 ng/mg for AP; 0.014 and 0.048 ng/mg for MA; 0.013 and 0.043 ng/mg for MDA; 0.017 and 0.057 ng/mg for MDMA; and 0.007 and 0.023 ng/mg for MDEA. The accuracy of the method was found to be in the range ± 9%, and the coefficients of variation were less than 8%. Overall, 24 hair specimens tested positive for one or more amphetamines, with average concentrations of 0.88 ng/mg for AP, 10.14 ng/mg for MA, 1.30 ng/mg for MDA, and 8.87 ng/mg for MDMA. Only one specimen tested positive for MDEA with a concentration of 0.84 ng/mg."

Sleep has a pivotal role in the consolidation of declarative memory. The coordinated neuronal replay of information encoded before sleep has been identified as a key process. It is assumed that the repeated reactivation of firing patterns in glutamatergic neuron assemblies translates into plastic synaptic changes underlying the formation of longer‐term neuronal representations. Here, we tested the effects of blocking and enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission during sleep on declarative memory consolidation in humans. We conducted three placebo‐controlled, crossover, double‐blind studies in which participants learned a word‐pair association task. Afterwards, they slept in a sleep laboratory and received glutamatergic modulators. Our first two studies aimed at impairing consolidation by administering the NMDA receptor blocker ketamine and the AMPA receptor blocker caroverine during retention sleep, which, paradoxically, remained unsuccessful, inasmuch as declarative memory performance was unaffected by the treatment. However, in the third study, administration of the NMDA receptor coagonist D‐cycloserine (DCS) during retention sleep facilitated consolidation of declarative memory (word pairs) but not consolidation of a procedural control task (finger sequence tapping). Administration of DCS during a wake interval remained without effect on retention of word pairs but improved encoding of numbers. From the overall pattern, we conclude that the consolidation of hippocampus‐dependent declarative memory during sleep relies on NMDA‐related plastic processes that differ from those processes leading to wake encoding. We speculate that glutamatergic activation during sleep is not only involved in consolidation but also in forgetting of hippocampal memory with both processes being differentially sensitive to DCS and unselective blockade of NMDA and AMPA receptors."
"3799","1","A comparison of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to non-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
RATIONALE: Novel, evidence-based treatments are required for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has beneficially augmented psychotherapy in several small clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To review the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD. METHODS: Systematic searches of four databases were conducted from inception to February 2020. A meta-analysis was performed on trials which were double-blinded, randomised, and compared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to psychotherapy and placebo. The primary outcomes were the differences in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) score and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcome measures included neurocognitive and physical adverse effects, at the time, and within 7 days of intervention. RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria. When compared to active placebo, intervention groups taking 75 mg (MD -46.90; 95% (confidence intervals) CI -58.78, -35.02), 125 mg (MD -20.98; 95% CI -34.35, -7.61) but not 100 mg (MD -12.90; 95% CI -36.09, 10.29) of MDMA with psychotherapy, had significant decreases in CAPS-IV scores, as did the inactive placebo arm (MD -33.20; 95% CI -40.53, -25.87). A significant decrease in BDI when compared to active placebo (MD -10.80; 95% CI -20.39, -1.21) was only observed at 75 mg. Compared to placebo, participants reported significantly more episodes of low mood, nausea and jaw-clenching during sessions and lack of appetite after 7 days. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate potential therapeutic benefit with minimal physical and neurocognitive risk for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in TR-PTSD, despite little effect on Beck's Depression Inventory. Better powered RCTs are required to investigate further. INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: CRD42019109132 available online at www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero."
"4210","0","Substance use and suicide outcomes among self-injured trauma patients.^
Background: Research indicates alcohol (AUD) or substance (SUD) use disorders and acute alcohol or drug use serve as risk factors for suicidal behaviors and death both distally and proximally to a suicidal event. However, limited research has investigated these relationships among medically serious suicide attempters at the time of injury without relying on cohorts of substance users only or by examining suicide decedent characteristics. Methods: Data were collected from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) for 2017. The sample comprised patients who engaged in suicidal and self-injurious acts that were medically serious enough to require trauma admission and were tested for alcohol (N = 9,196) or drug (N = 8,121) exposure upon admission. Logistic regression determined relationships between acute alcohol/substance use, presence of AUDs and SUDs and suicide mortality risk, while linear regression evaluated substance conditions and injury severity and length of stay (LOS). Results: AUDs (OR = 0.59[0.42−0.83]) and SUDs (OR = 0.66[0.48−0.90]) had reduced odds of death but increased LOS (β = 1.7, p < .001; β = 0.82, p = .024). Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was positively associated with reduced odds of death (OR = 0.20[0.06−0.61]), injury severity (β = −5.3, p < .001), and LOS (β = −7.5, p < .001). Presence of cocaine (β = −0.80, p = .044) and opioids (β = −1.4, p < .001) were associated lower injury severity, while MDMA (β = 3.6, p = .016) and methamphetamine (β = 1.5, p = .025) were associated with increased injury severity. Conclusions: While higher BAC may be associated with lower odds of mortality during a single high-risk suicide event, substance users may be at increased risk for worse outcomes over time. Targeted interventions should be considered to interrupt and develop healthy alternatives for survivors with substance use conditions."
"4522","1","Evaluating global brain connectivity as an imaging marker for depression: influence of preprocessing strategies and placebo-controlled ketamine treatment.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity (GBC), as assessed via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations of GBC as a putative imaging marker. These results were obtained via global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: (1) regression of white matter (WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); (2) WM/CSF + GSR (GSR); and (3) WM/CSF + physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Reduced GBC was observed in individuals with MDD only at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as in the prefrontal cortex only after regressing the global signal. Ketamine had no effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group in any pipeline. PHYSIO did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR. These results concur with several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Further investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD."

BACKGROUND: This randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover trial examined the antidepressant efficacy of the muscarinic antagonist scopolamine in major depressive disorder subjects with more severe and refractory forms of major depressive disorder relative to previous reports. METHODS: Participants included 23 medication-free major depressive disorder subjects (12 F/11 M, 20-55 years) currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Subjects had scored ≥20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Following a single-blind, placebo lead-in, participants were randomized to receive 2 counterbalanced blocks of 3 i.v. infusions of scopolamine (4 μg/kg) and placebo in a double-blind manner. The primary and secondary outcomes were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively. Magnetoencephalography and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations were obtained prior to and after each treatment phase. RESULTS: As assessed by both the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, scopolamine had no significant antidepressant or anxiolytic effects relative to placebo. No significant drug vs placebo effects were seen in magnetoencephalography gamma power or brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma concentrations, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor changes did not correlate with change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score in response to scopolamine. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the efficacy of scopolamine for more severe or refractory forms of depression. No pre- to post-infusion changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor were detected, and magnetoencephalography gamma power changed only in the placebo lead-in, suggesting that these biomarker measures were not affected by scopolamine in this cohort. While difficult to interpret given the lack of antidepressant response, the findings suggest that the neurobiological effects of ketamine and scopolamine are at least partly distinct."
"2151","1","Antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of ayahuasca: A systematic literature review of animal and human studies.^
Objective: To conduct a systematic literature review of animal and human studies reporting anxiolytic or antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or some of its isolated alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline). Methods: Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection. Results: Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression. Conclusion: Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated."
"9250","1","Pharmacogenetic studies of change in cortisol on ecstasy (MDMA) consumption.^
In this study we investigate the association of cytochrome P450 enzyme CYP2D6, catechol-O-methyl transferase (COMT, Val158Met) and serotonin transporter promoter (5-HTTLPR) genotypes on change in cortisol concentration following 3, 4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') consumption. Forty-eight subjects (30 males, mean age 23 years), self-nominating regular clubbers provided 'in the field' pre- and post-clubbing biological samples and associated information. Of the 39 subjects who provided a post-clubbing urine sample, 21 were positive for MDMA. Plasma cortisol concentrations increased in subjects (n=48) tested for cortisol, with changes being significantly greater in the MDMA-positive group (736.9±83.2 vs. 350.9±34.5mmol/l, p=0.001). We found a positive association between the low activity COMT genotype (Met/Met) and MDMA-induced change in cortisol and also between this and change in cortisol in the whole sample (p=0.039, Bonferroni corrected). For CYP2D6, there was an association between genotype and change in cortisol, confined to subjects with MDMA-positive urine post-clubbing (p=0.003, Bonferroni corrected). There was no association with 5-HTTLPR genotype. These associations suggest that chronic use of MDMA may lead to HPA axis dysregulation and that the magnitude of this may be moderated by genetic polymorphism, and warrant further investigation in a larger sample of those who consume the drug on a regular basis. © 2012 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"4821","0","Effect of four-week cannabidiol treatment on cognitive function: secondary outcomes from a randomised clinical trial for the treatment of cannabis use disorder.^
RATIONALE: Chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired cognitive function. Evidence indicates cannabidiol (CBD) might be beneficial for treating cannabis use disorder. CBD may also have pro-cognitive effects; however, its effect on cognition in people with cannabis use disorder is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether a 4-week CBD treatment impacted cognitive function. We hypothesised that CBD treatment would improve cognition from baseline to week 4, compared to placebo. METHODS: Cognition was assessed as a secondary outcome in a phase 2a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4-week daily 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg CBD for the treatment of cannabis use disorder. Participants had moderate or severe DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and intended to quit cannabis use. Our pre-registered primary cognitive outcome was delayed prose recall. Secondary cognitive outcomes were immediate prose recall, stop signal reaction time, trail-making task performance, verbal fluency and digit span. RESULTS: Seventy participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 23), 400 mg CBD (n = 24) and 800 mg CBD (n = 23). A 200 mg group was eliminated from the trial because it was an inefficacious dose at interim analysis (n = 12) and was not analysed here. For the primary cognitive outcome, there was no effect of CBD compared to placebo, evidenced by a lack of dose-by-time interaction at 400 mg (0.46, 95%CIs: - 1.41, 2.54) and 800 mg (0.89, 95%CIs: - 0.99, 2.81). There was no effect of CBD compared to placebo on secondary cognitive outcomes, except backwards digit span which increased following 800 mg CBD (0.30, 95%CIs: 0.02, 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical trial for cannabis use disorder, CBD did not influence delayed verbal memory. CBD did not have broad cognitive effects but 800 mg daily treatment may improve working memory manipulation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02044809) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2013-000,361-36)."

BACKGROUND: The following study evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the UK Medical Cannabis Registry, who were treated with inhaled dried flower (Adven® EMT2, Curaleaf International, Guernsey), and sublingual/oral medium-chain triglyceride-based oils (Adven, Curaleaf International, Guernsey) for chronic pain. METHODS: In this cohort study, the primary outcomes were changes in validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 1, 3, and 6 months compared to baseline, and adverse event analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-eight (45.7%), 36 (4.7%), and 377 (49.5%) patients were treated with oils, dried flower, or both, respectively. Patients treated with oils or combination therapy recorded improvements within health-related quality of life, pain, and sleep-specific PROMs at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.050). Patients treated with combination therapy recorded improvements in anxiety-specific PROMs at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.050). 1,273 (167.3%) adverse events were recorded, with previously cannabis naïve users, ex-cannabis users, and females more likely to experience adverse events (p < 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: This study observed an association between initiation of CBMP treatment and improved outcomes for chronic pain patients. Prior cannabis use and gender were associated with adverse event incidence. Placebo-controlled trials are still necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of CBMPs for chronic pain."
"8010","1","Is depersonalization disorder initiated by illicit drug use any different? A survey of 394 adults.^
Objective: Previous studies have documented that in a substantial minority of individuals with depersonalization disorder, onset is first triggered by illicit drug ingestion. The goal of this study was to systematically compare a large sample of individuals with drug-initiated (D) versus non-drug-initiated (ND) chronic depersonalization. Method: We conducted an internet survey of 394 adults endorsing DSM-IV-TR depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms. Sixty-four questions were utilized to inquire about demographic and clinical characteristics, illness course, substance use history, and treatment response. The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) was administered. The study was conducted from September 2005 to January 2006. Results: Compared to the ND group (n = 198), the D group (n = 196) included more male and younger individuals. The 2 most common precipitating drugs were cannabis and hallucinogens, followed by ecstasy. The majority of participants had modest use histories prior to onset and never ingested subsequently. The 2 groups endorsed similar illness course, impairment, suicidality, and limited treatment response. The D group showed significantly greater improvement over time than the ND group (P = .002), although the groups did not differ in reported psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy effectiveness. The groups did not differ in CDS total score or on the 4 subscale scores of unreality of self, perceptual alterations, unreality of surroundings, and temporal disintegration. On the numbing subscale of the CDS, the ND group scored higher (P = .009) only prior to controlling for age and gender. Conclusion: The study strongly supports a uniform syndrome for chronic depersonalization/derealization regardless of precipitant. © Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."
"224","1","Efficacy of esketamine in the treatment of depression with psychotic features: A case series.^
This small case series provides evidence of the safety and efficacy of esketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with psychotic features. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment of TRD with psychotic symptoms with esketamine administered subcutaneously. Ketamine has been used to induce a pharmacological model of psychosis, because it produces a syndrome consisting of disordered thought, perceptual abnormalities, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and memory impairments in healthy subjects. Because of that, nearly all clinical and research protocols have used the presence of psychotic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for treatment with ketamine. However, different sources of evidence have suggested that psychotic manifestations associated with ketamine are transient and clinically non significant. Although ketamine has significant perceptual effects, they are transient and usually occur at higher doses than those necessary for depression treatment. In addition, the findings of the present study are in line with previous studies reporting remission of both depressive and psychotic symptoms after treatment of patients with depression and acute psychosis or a history of psychosis. Moreover, studies examining patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern of psychotomimetic manifestations following low-dose ketamine administration. Notably, they experienced mild, short-lasting increases in psychotic symptoms, but these had no impact on the longterm outcome of these patients with psychosis. As previously suggested, inclusion of patients with psychotic depression in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine should be encouraged.

"4643","1","MDMA intoxication and verbal memory performance: a placebo-controlled pharmaco-MRI study.^
The aim of the present study was to identify the neural substrate underlying memory impairment due to a single dose of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) by means of pharmaco-MRI. Based on previous behavioral results it was hypothesized that this deficit could be attributed to a specific influence of MDMA on encoding. Fourteen Ecstasy users participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with two treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg) and placebo. Memory performance was tested by means of a word learning task including two words lists, one addressing reading processes (control task, CWL) and a second (experimental task, EWL) addressing encoding and reading processes. Behavioral data showed that under the influence of MDMA, EWL performance was worse than placebo. Imaging data showed that Encoding was situated mainly in (pre)frontal, temporal and parietal areas. MDMA by Encoding interaction was situated in three areas: the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the right fusiform gyrus (BA19), and the left cuneus (BA18). Behavioral and functional data only correlated in BA10. It appeared that EWL performance caused BOLD signal change in BA10 during placebo treatment but not during MDMA intoxication. It is concluded that MDMA influences middle frontal gyrus processes resulting in impoverished memory encoding."
"9031","0","Naltrexone alters the processing of social and emotional stimuli in healthy adults.^
Endogenous opioids have complex social effects that may depend on specific receptor actions and vary depending on the stage of social behavior (e.g., seeking vs. responding to social stimuli). We tested the effects of a nonspecific opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on social processing in humans. NTX is used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence, and may affect both mu and kappa-opioid systems. We assessed attention (seeking), and subjective and psychophysiological responses (responding) to positive and negative social stimuli. Based on literature suggesting mu-opioid blockade impairs positive social responses, we hypothesized that NTX would decrease responses to positive social stimuli. We also tested responses to negative stimuli, which might be either increased by NTX's mu-opioid effects or decreased by its kappa-opioid effects. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received placebo, 25mg, or 50mg NTX across three sessions under double-blind conditions. At each session, participants completed measures of attention, identification, and emotional responses for emotional faces and scenes. NTX increased attention to emotional expressions, slowed identification of sadness and fear, and decreased ratings of arousal for social and nonsocial emotional scenes. These findings are more consistent with anxiolytic kappa-antagonist than mu-blocking effects, suggesting effects on kappa receptors may contribute to the clinical effects of NTX."

There is a range of therapies to treat Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) but treatment resistance remains high, with many sufferers experiencing the chronic condition. Engagement in trauma-focused psychotherapy is difficult for some patients with PTSD, especially those with extreme affect dysregulation associated with recall of traumatic memories. In recent years there have been a number of neuroscientific and clinical studies examining the potential role for adjunctive drug-assisted psychotherapy using 3,4,-methylenedioxmethamphetamine (MDMA) as a treatment for PTSD. re-visiting of a novel approach to trauma-focused psychotherapy with Used just two or three times, under careful medical supervision and specialised psychotherapy support MDMA appears to facilitate the recall of traumatic memories without the user feeling overwhelmed by the negative affect that usually accompanies such memories. This therapeutic approach began in the 1980s and was subsequently shelved in the midst of public health concerns surrounding the recreational use of the drug ecstasy. When pharmaceutical grade MDMA is used in a clinical setting it does not share the same risk profiles as ecstasy. Recent phase one neurophysiological studies and phase two clinical studies are showing promise as a potential new approach to managing treatment-resistant PTSD."

Recreational use of mephedrone, alone and in combination with alcohol, has increased over the past years. Pharmacological properties of mephedrone share similarities with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but its effect on neurocognitive function has not been well established in humans. The present study assessed the effect of mephedrone alone and after co-administration with alcohol on neurocognitive function. It was hypothesised that mephedrone would improve psychomotor performance but impair memory performance, when administered alone. Neurocognitive performance was expected to be impaired following mephedrone when combined with alcohol. Eleven participants received single doses of 200 mg mephedrone or placebo combined with 0.8 g/kg alcohol or placebo. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline (T(0)), at one hour (T(1)) and four hours after (T(2)) mephedrone administration, by means of the Divided Attention Task (DAT), Critical Tracking Task (CTT), and the Spatial Memory Test (SMT). Mephedrone intoxication impaired short-term spatial memory at T(1) and improved critical tracking performance at T(2) Mephedrone alone did not affect divided attention, but did show an interaction with alcohol on reaction time at T(2) Reaction time decreased when mephedrone was combined with alcohol as compared to alcohol alone. Alcohol intoxication impaired both short- and long-term spatial memory at T(1) and divided attention at T(1) and T(2) Critical tracking performance was not affected by alcohol intoxication. The current findings support the hypothesis that mephedrone improves psychomotor performance, impairs spatial memory and does not affect divided attention performance. Stimulatory effects of mephedrone were not sufficient to compensate for the impairing effects of alcohol on most performance parameters."
"1087","0","Antidepressant effects of ketamine: mechanisms underlying fast-acting novel antidepressants.^
Newer antidepressants are needed for the many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) that do not respond adequately to treatment and because of a delay of weeks before the emergence of therapeutic effects. Recent evidence from clinical trials shows that the NMDA antagonist ketamine is a revolutionary novel antidepressant because it acts rapidly and is effective for treatment-resistant patients. A single infusion of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours and these effects may be sustained for up to 2 weeks. Although the discovery of ketamine's effects has reshaped drug discovery for antidepressants, the psychotomimetic properties of this compound limit the use of this therapy to the most severely ill patients. In order to develop additional antidepressants like ketamine, adequate preclinical behavioral screening paradigms for fast-acting antidepressants need to be established and used to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines the preclinical literature attempting to model the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Acute administration of ketamine has produced effects in behavioral screens for antidepressants like the forced swim test, novelty suppression of feeding and in rodent models for depression. Protracted behavioral effects of ketamine have been reported to appear after a single treatment that last for days. This temporal pattern is similar to its clinical effects and may serve as a new animal paradigm for rapid antidepressant effects in humans. In addition, protracted changes in molecules mediating synaptic plasticity have been implicated in mediating the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ketamine. Current preclinical studies are examining compounds with more specific pharmacological effects at glutamate receptors and synapses in order to develop additional rapidly acting antidepressants without the hallucinogenic side effects or abuse potential of ketamine."
"2102","1","Direct comparison of the acute subjective, emotional, autonomic, and endocrine effects of MDMA, methylphenidate, and modafinil in healthy subjects.^
RATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects. METHODS: We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI). RESULTS: All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA induced subjective, emotional, sexual, and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used."
"1703","1","Neurocognitive impact of ketamine treatment in major depressive disorder: A review on human and animal studies.^
BACKGROUND: Most recent evidence support a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, clinical and animal studies investigating the effects of intravenous ketamine on specific functional domains disrupted by depression reported conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent findings exploring the cognitive effects of ketamine in depression. METHODS: After a bibliographic search on PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo, we retrieved 11 original studies meeting our research criteria, 7 in humans with MDD or Treatment Resistant Disorder and 4 using rats models for depression. RESULTS: Overall the results showed that a) ketamine reduced activation and normalized connectivity measures of several brain regions related to depressive behaviors and reversed deficits in cognitive flexibility and coping response strategy in rats with depressive features, and b) ketamine leads to a no significant impairment on neurocognitive functions in most of the studies, with only three studies observing improvements in speed of processing, verbal learning, sustained attention and response control, verbal and working memory. LIMITATIONS: The methodological heterogeneity, in terms of neuropsychological tests used and cognitive domain explored, of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies included showed no significant cognitive impairments in MDD patients after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, the results of the fMRI studies considered suggest that ketamine may have a normalizing effect on brain functions during attentional and emotional processing in MDD patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary evidences."

BACKGROUND: There is a paucity of high-quality data on patient outcomes and safety after initiating treatment with cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes and safety of CBMPs by analyzing patient-reported outcome measures and adverse events across a broad spectrum of chronic conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study analyzed patients enrolled in the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. Participants completed the EQ-5D-5L to assess health-related quality of life, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire to measure anxiety severity, and the Single-item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) to rate sleep quality at baseline and follow-up after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 2833 participants met inclusion criteria. The EQ-5D-5L index value, GAD-7, and SQS all improved at each follow-up (p < 0.001). There was no difference in EQ-5D-5L index values between former or current illicit cannabis consumers and naïve patients (p > 0.050). Adverse events were reported by 474 (16.73%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that CBMPs are associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life in UK patients with chronic diseases. Treatment was tolerated well by most participants, but adverse events were more common in female and cannabis-naïve patients."

"4708","1","Efficacy of repeated intravenous esketamine in adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious depression.^
BACKGROUND: Patients with anxious major depressive disorder (MDD) are more likely to have poorer outcomes than those with non-anxious MDD. However, the effect of esketamine on adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious MDD has remained unknown. AIMS: We compared the efficacy of esketamine in adolescents with MDD and suicidal ideation, both anxious and non-anxious. METHODS: Fifty-four adolescents with anxious (n=33) and non-anxious (n=21) MDD received three infusions of esketamine 0.25 mg/kg or active-placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg) over 5 days, with routine inpatient care and treatment. Suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Multiple-sample proportional tests were used to compare the differences between groups on treatment outcomes 24 hours after the final infusion (day 6, primacy efficacy endpoint) and throughout the 4-week post-treatment (days 12, 19 and 33). RESULTS: In subjects who received esketamine, a greater number of patients in the non-anxious group than the anxious group achieved antisuicidal remission on day 6 (72.7% vs 18.8%, p=0.015) and day 12 (90.9% vs 43.8%, p=0.013), and the non-anxious group had a higher antidepressant remission rate compared with the anxious group on day 33 (72.7% vs 26.7%, p=0.045). No significant differences in treatment outcomes were observed between the anxious and non-anxious groups at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: Three infusions of esketamine as an adjunct to routine inpatient care and treatment had a greater immediate post-treatment antisuicidal effect in adolescents with non-anxious MDD than in those with anxious MDD; however, this benefit was temporary and was not maintained over time.

"6236","1","5-HT2A Agonist Psilocybin in the Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder.^
This is a multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized clinical trial of the 5‐HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin for smoking cessation. The investigators previously conducted an open‐label pilot trial (N = 15) of psilocybin paired with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Data showed a biologically‐verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence rate of 67% at 12 months and 60% at 2.5 years (continuous abstinence rates: 53% and 47%, respectively). The investigators are now conducting an open‐label randomized comparative efficacy trial of psilocybin vs. nicotine patch, both in combination with CBT. Interim results (N = 44; 22 per group) show greater biologically‐verified abstinence rates at 12 months for psilocybin: 7‐day point‐prevalence: 59% vs. 27%; continuous abstinence: 36% vs. 9%. Despite these promising findings, the investigators have yet to conduct a double‐blind study of psilocybin for smoking cessation. Furthermore, previous psilocybin study samples have been largely White with higher socioeconomic status (SES). The current trial will address these issues across three sites with experience in conducting psilocybin research: Johns Hopkins, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and New York University (NYU). A diverse sample with regard to ethno‐racial identity and SES will be recruited at each site. The proposed double‐blind study will treat 66 participants (22 at each site), randomized to receive either: 1) psilocybin; 20 mg/70 in session 1 and 30 mg/70 kg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart; or 2) niacin; 250 mg in session 1 and 375 mg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart. Niacin was selected because it has been used as an active placebo in two previous randomized therapeutic trials of psilocybin, and the FDA has informed the investigators that niacin is the FDA's preferred active placebo for psilocybin. CBT will be administered to both groups and will allow the investigators to test psilocybin's efficacy above and beyond an established treatment approach. Biochemically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence will be assessed throughout for up to 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin (compared to niacin) will cause increased biologically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐month follow‐up. Based on pilot data, the investigators will test cognitive/psychological mediators of treatment response. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin will be associated with improved cognitive control and decreased anticipation of withdrawal relief (from smoking) 1 day after the target quit date, which will be associated with greater 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐ month follow‐up. This trial will provide a rigorous test of efficacy in a diverse study sample, and test relevant mechanisms, for an innovative smoking cessation treatment showing potential for substantial efficacy."
"1088","0","Long-term increase in sensitivity to ketamine's behavioral effects in mice exposed to mild blast induced traumatic brain injury.^
Neurobehavioral deficits emerge in nearly 50% of patients following a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may persist for months. Ketamine is used frequently as an anesthetic/analgesic and for management of persistent psychiatric complications. Although ketamine may produce beneficial effects in patients with a history of TBI, differential sensitivity to its impairing effects could make the therapeutic use of ketamine in TBI patients unsafe. This series of studies examined male C57BL/6 J mice exposed to a mild single blast overpressure (mbTBI) for indications of altered sensitivity to ketamine at varying times after injury. Dystaxia (altered gait), diminished sensorimotor gating (reduced prepulse inhibition) and impaired working memory (step-down inhibitory avoidance) were examined in mbTBI and sham animals 15 min following intraperitoneal injections of saline or R, S-ketamine hydrochloride, from day 7-16 post injury and again from day 35-43 post injury. Behavioral performance in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test were evaluated on day 28 and day 74 post injury respectively, 24 h following drug administration. Dynamic gait stability was compromised in mbTBI mice on day 7 and 35 post injury and further exacerbated following ketamine administration. On day 14 and 42 post injury, prepulse inhibition was robustly decreased by mbTBI, which ketamine further reduced. Ketamine-associated memory impairment was apparent selectively in mbTBI animals 1 h, 24 h and day 28 post shock (tested on day 15/16/43 post injury). Ketamine selectively reduced immobility scores in the FST in mbTBI animals (day 28) and reversed mbTBI induced decreases in sucrose consumption (Day 74). These results demonstrate increased sensitivity to ketamine in mice when tested for extended periods after TBI. The results suggest that ketamine may be effective for treating neuropsychiatric complications that emerge after TBI but urge caution when used in clinical practice for enhanced sensitivity to its side effects in this patient population."
"7314","0","Experimental studies on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ECSTASY"") and its potential to damage brain serotonin neurons.^
A number of drugs that fall into the broad category of ""ring-substituted amphetamines"" have been found to be neurotoxic toward brain monoamine neurons in animals. Several of these drugs, including (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") and methamphetamine (""speed"") and fenfluramine (""Pondimin"") have been used or abused by humans. A growing body of evidence indicates that humans, like animals, are susceptible to substituted amphetamine-induced neurotoxic injury, and that consequences of this injury can be subtle. This article will review the effects of ring-substituted amphetamine analogs on brain monoamine neurons, using MDMA as the prototype. Studies documenting MDMA neurotoxic potential toward brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals are summarized first. Human MDMA studies are then discussed, beginning with a consideration of methodological challenges in evaluating the status of 5-HT neurons in the living human brain. Recent findings indicating possible functional alterations in brain serotonergic systems in humans with a history of extensive MDMA exposure are then presented, including some new findings on sleep and personality in abstinent MDMA users."
"3930","0","Computerized cerebral biopotentials in the discovery of psychotropic drugs.^
Quantitative pharmaco electroencephalography is a process involving the use of digital computer analyzed scalp recorded cerebral biopotentials as well as a series of statistical procedures for establishing the central effect of a new compound in humans, predicting its clinical (psychiatric) usefulness, and estimating its effective dosage range, as well as onset and duration of effects, all after a single oral dose. Although a conventional EEG consists of recorded cerebral activity, only 3 of 22 measurements of the computer analysis which are used for the statistical differentiation of psychotropic drugs, are comparable with the activities considered for clinical electroencephalography. Using quantitative pharmaco EEG the author has, in the past, predicted minor or major tranquillizer or thymoleptic effects of a series of compounds. Although the clinical trials confirmed the prediction of quantitative pharmaco EEG, the findings had limited value as the clinical profiles of the drugs given for investigation had already been predicted, based on animal pharmacology. Just recently, however, the thymoleptic properties of a new compound (GB 94, N.V. Organon) were predicted, which did not have pharmacological or biochemical properties of the existing antidepressive compounds and, accordingly, was not predicted by animal pharmacology to be a psychotropic drug. Clinical trials confirmed the prediction. Thus, GB 94 became the first psychotropic drug discovered based on an EEG model alone. The investigations indicated that computer analyses of cerebral biopotentials, particularly of relatively high frequency waves, are important parameters which reveal characteristic changes with different psychotropic drugs and with different dosages of the same compound. Accordingly, the study of computerized cerebral biopotentials is an extremely useful technique in defining the bioavailability of psychotropic drugs and in determining dose response curves."

Twenty‐six in‐patients with Diagnostic and Statistical Manual version IV (DSM‐IV) criteria for opioid dependence were selected at random to receive either a combination of an 11‐day low‐dose buprenorphine and a 14‐day carbamazepine regimen (n = 14) or a combination of an 11‐day methadone and a 14‐day carbamazepine regimen (n = 12) in a double‐blind, randomized 14‐day in‐patient detoxification treatment. Patients with buprenorphine and carbamazepine showed a significantly better psychological state after the first and second weeks of treatment. Above all, the buprenorphine‐treated patients demonstrated a less marked tiredness, sensitiveness and depressive state as well as a more prominent elevated mood during the detoxification process. Seven non‐completers (after 7 days: four of 12 = 33.3%; after 14 days: seven of 12 = 58.3%) were treated with methadone and carbamazepine and five non‐completers (after 7 days: two of 14 = 14.3%; after 14 days: five of 14 = 35.7%) received buprenorphine and carbamazepine. The difference in the overall dropout rate after day 14 was not significant. The present study supports the hypothesis that the combination of buprenorphine and carbamazepine leads to a better clinical outcome than does a combination of methadone and carbamazepine in the detoxification of opioid addicts with additional multiple drug abuse. The buprenorphine and carbamazepine‐regimen provides a more effective short‐term relief of affective disturbances than does methadone and carbamazepine. No severe side effects occurred during the treatment period in both groups."

The literature and the findings from the Camarillo Schizophrenia Research Project reported in this paper indicate that a satisfactory method for predicting the response of an individual schizophrenic patient to antipsychotic drugs has yet to be devised. A test dose procedure is described which offers promise of a practical approach to selecting the most appropriate drug and dosage for a particular patient and tailoring blood concentrations to the needs of the individual case. Preliminary findings indicate that the test dose procedure is feasible; that detectable changes occur after a single test dose; and that measurements made during the test dose period may be predictive of eventual outcome. These findings are, of course, only a report of a preliminary pilot experiment, subject to important caveats about small number of cases, interpretation of large numbers of correlation coefficients, and need for cross validation. Nevertheless they are encouraging and suggest that the test dose approach has considerable potential for further research."
"6725","1","Saturday night fever in ecstasy/MDMA dance clubbers: Heightened body temperature and associated psychobiological changes.^
Aims and rationale: to investigate body temperature and thermal self-ratings of Ecstasy/MDMA users at a Saturday night dance club. Methods: 68 dance clubbers (mean age 21.6 years, 30 females and 38 males), were assessed at a Saturday night dance club, then 2–3 d later. Three subgroups were compared: 32 current Ecstasy users who had taken Ecstasy/MDMA that evening, 10 abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users on other psychoactive drugs, and 26 non-user controls (predominantly alcohol drinkers). In a comparatively quiet area of the dance club, each unpaid volunteer had their ear temperature recorded, and completed a questionnaire on thermal feelings and mood states. A similar questionnaire was repeated 2–3 d later by mobile telephone. Results: Ecstasy/MDMA users had a mean body temperature 1.2°C higher than non-user controls (P < 0.001), and felt significantly hotter and thirstier. The abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA polydrug user group had a mean body temperature intermediate between the other 2 groups, significantly higher than controls, and significantly lower than current Ecstasy/MDMA users. After 2–3 d of recovery, the Ecstasy/MDMA users remained significantly ‘thirstier’. Higher body temperature while clubbing was associated with greater Ecstasy/MDMA usage at the club, and younger age of first use. Higher temperature also correlated with lower elation and poor memory 2–3 d later. It also correlated positively with nicotine, and negatively with cannabis. Conclusions: Ecstasy/MDMA using dance clubbers had significantly higher body temperature than non-user controls. This heightened body temperature was associated with a number of adverse psychobiological consequences, including poor memory. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

"603","1","Efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of depressive symptoms in palliative care: A systematic review.^
OBJECTIVES: Ketamine has a fast onset of action that may offer a paradigm change for depression management at the end of life. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of ketamine in depression treatment within a broad palliative care concept. METHODS: We searched seven databases and included studies on the safety and efficacy of ketamine for depression treatment in patients diagnosed with any life-threatening disease. We also conducted a narrative review of the evidence. RESULTS: Among 2,252 screened titles and abstracts, we included 32 studies in our final synthesis: 14 case reports, two case series, two quasi-experimental studies, and seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs), as well as data from three unpublished clinical trials and seven cases from four larger case series. Most case reports reported a robust effect; however, the larger studies reported conflicting findings. Five RCTs reported positive outcomes; however, four of them were focused on a perioperative setting. Two negative studies did not primarily focus on depression and did not apply severity cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Although ketamine is generally safe and potentially useful, its efficacy in palliative care settings remains unclear. It may be a reasonable alternative for perioperative depression in oncological patients."
"8710","1","How to account for hallucinations in the interpretation of the antidepressant effects of psychedelics: a translational framework.^
RATIONALE: Recent trials with psychedelics in major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression showed remarkable improvements in depressive symptoms that can last for up to several months after even a single administration. The lack of an appropriate placebo control group-as patients are often able to discriminate the subjective effects of the drug-and an incomplete understanding of the role of the hallucinogenic and mystical experience, hampers the interpretation of these therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVES: To control for these factors, we developed a translational framework based on establishing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in rodents and humans for hallucinogenic (i.e., discriminative stimulus effects in rodents and humans; head twitch responses in rodents; questionnaires in humans) and therapeutic effects. For the latter, we selected the pattern separation and attentional set-shifting tasks as measures for cognitive flexibility because of their high translational value. We predict that these PK/PD analyses will lead to a more objective evaluation of improvements in patients compared to relying only on the currently used self-reported questionnaires. We hypothesize that-if the role of the hallucinogenic experience is not central in the antidepressant effects of psychedelics-the ED(50)'s for the therapeutic effects will be significantly lower than for the hallucinogenic and mystical effects. CONCLUSION: Our framework will help to inform future studies that aim at the elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action of psychedelics in depression, and the role of the acute subjective and/or hallucinogenic experience in their effects."
"404","0","More than meets the eye: The role of sensory dimensions in psychedelic brain dynamics, experience, and therapeutics.^
Psychedelics are undergoing a major resurgence of scientific and clinical interest. While multiple theories and frameworks have been proposed, there is yet no universal agreement on the mechanisms underlying the complex effects of psychedelics on subjective experience and brain dynamics, nor their therapeutic benefits. Despite being prominent in psychedelic phenomenology and distinct from those elicited by other classes of hallucinogens, the effects of psychedelics on low-level sensory - particularly visual - dimensions of experience, and corresponding brain dynamics, have often been disregarded by contemporary research as 'epiphenomenal byproducts'. Here, we review available evidence from neuroimaging, pharmacology, questionnaires, and clinical studies; we propose extensions to existing models, provide testable hypotheses for the potential therapeutic roles of psychedelic-induced visual hallucinations, and simulations of visual phenomena relying on low-level cortical dynamics. In sum, we show that psychedelic-induced alterations in low-level sensory dimensions 1) are unlikely to be entirely causally reconducible to high-level alterations, but rather co-occur with them in a dialogical interplay, and 2) are likely to play a causally relevant role in determining high-level alterations and therapeutic outcomes. We conclude that reevaluating the currently underappreciated role of sensory dimensions in psychedelic states will be highly valuable for neuroscience and clinical practice, and that integrating low-level and domain-specific aspects of psychedelic effects into existing nonspecific models is a necessary step to further understand how these substances effect both acute and long-term change in the human brain."
"3791","1","Course of improvement in depressive symptoms to a single intravenous infusion of ketamine vs add-on riluzole: results from a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^
The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD); these effects have been reported to last for 1 week in some patients. However, the extent and duration of this antidepressant effect over longer periods has not been well characterized under controlled conditions. Riluzole, a glutamatergic modulator with antidepressant and synaptic plasticity-enhancing effects, could conceivably be used to promote the antidepressant effects of ketamine. This study sought to determine the extent and time course of antidepressant improvement to a single-ketamine infusion over 4 weeks, comparing the addition of riluzole vs placebo after the infusion. Forty-two subjects (18-65) with TRD and a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of ≥ 22 received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Four to six hours post-infusion, subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment with either riluzole (100-200 mg/day; n=21) or placebo (n=21) for 4 weeks. Depressive symptoms were rated daily. A significant improvement (P<0.001) in MADRS scores from baseline was found. The effect size of improvement with ketamine was initially large and remained moderate throughout the 28-day trial. Overall, 27% of ketamine responders had not relapsed by 4 weeks following a single ketamine infusion. The average time to relapse was 13.2 days (SE=2.2). However, the difference between the riluzole and placebo treatment groups was not significant, suggesting that the combination of riluzole with ketamine treatment did not significantly alter the course of antidepressant response to ketamine alone."
"4248","0","Inhibition of return in schizophrenia: A review.^
Introduction. - Most visual environments contain more information than the human brain can process in real time. To overcome this limitation, the attention system acts as a filter by selectively orienting attention to specific regions of the visual field. This ability to orient attention can be reflected in covert shift processes of attention. Literature findings. - In a typical covert orienting task, subjects have to maintain fixation on a central cross and respond as quickly as possible to a target, which appears in a peripheral. box following a cue that summons attention to the direction where the target is going to appear (valid cueing) or to the contralateral direction (invalid cueing). When the cues are nonpredictive, the response characteristics critically depend on stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). With short SOAs (< 300 ms), valid cues result in a reaction time advantage over invalid trials, which is due to a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. In contrast, with longer SOAs, valid cues result in longer reaction times to the subsequent target. Discussion. - This phenomenon is known as the inhibition of return and is mostly thought to reflect an inhibitory mechanism protecting the organism from redirecting attention to previously scanned insignificant locations. Many studies have reported blunted or delayed inhibition of return in patients with schizophrenia. However, some authors reported normal amounts of inhibition of return. This can be partly explained by the use of manipulations of the covert orienting of the attention paradigm that is known to enhance the course of inhibition of return. Conclusion. - The deficit of inhibition of return seems to be time-stable and to be unrelated to psychopathology or length of illness. The contribution of neuroleptic medication to this deficit cannot be determined. Recent data suggest a deficit of inhibition of return in two human models of psychosis (dimethyltryptamine and ketamine). Further studies should clarify whether blunted inhibition of return might represent a trait marker of schizophrenia. (c) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008."
"2223","1","Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^
In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'). The use of alcohol (ethanol) in combination with ecstasy is common. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine men, seven women) between the ages of 18 and 29. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo-steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10% intravenous ethanol clamp. MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal. Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation. Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol-induced sedation. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90-150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration, with the exception of ethanol-induced sedation, which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped. In conclusion, results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo, but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired. These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy."
"7460","1","Microdosing psychedelics: Demographics, practices, and psychiatric comorbidities.^
RATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics - the practice of consuming small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of substances such as LSD or psilocybin - is gaining attention in popular media but remains poorly characterized. Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13 mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)). CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this practice in clinical populations and to test claims about potential benefits."
"1768","0","The psychotomimetic effects of intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in healthy individuals: implications for psychosis.^
Recent advances in the understanding of brain cannabinoid receptor function have renewed interest in the association between cannabinoid compounds and psychosis. In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced study, the behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine effects of 0, 2.5, and 5 mg intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) were characterized in 22 healthy individuals, who had been exposed to cannabis but had never been diagnosed with a cannabis abuse disorder. Prospective safety data at 1, 3, and 6 months poststudy was also collected. Delta-9-THC (1) produced schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms; (2) altered perception; (3) increased anxiety; (4) produced euphoria; (5) disrupted immediate and delayed word recall, sparing recognition recall; (6) impaired performance on tests of distractibility, verbal fluency, and working memory (7) did not impair orientation; (8) increased plasma cortisol. These data indicate that Delta-9-THC produces a broad range of transient symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits in healthy individuals that resemble some aspects of endogenous psychoses. These data warrant further study of whether brain cannabinoid receptor function contributes to the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders."
"365","0","Ketamine for Depression, 6: Effects on Suicidal Ideation and Possible Use as Crisis Intervention in Patients at Suicide Risk.^
A growing body of literature suggests that ketamine, administered in subanesthetic doses, has early-onset antidepressant action in patients with severe and even treatment-refractory depression. Many case reports, open-label studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that ketamine may have dramatic antisuicidal effects, as well. This article examines the benefits of ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation with particular focus on the findings of recent RCTs and meta-analyses. Important findings are that a single dose of ketamine is associated with antisuicidal benefits that emerge within an hour of administration and persist for up to a week. The benefits are seen in patients with mild as well as clinically significant suicidal ideation. The benefits are observed in midazolam- as well as saline-controlled trials. Effect sizes are medium to large. The improvement in suicidal ideation is only partly explained by improvement in depression severity. It is concluded that there is consistent evidence that a single dose of ketamine has dramatic antisuicidal action that emerges almost immediately after dosing and persists for at least a week. The short- and intermediate-term safety and efficacy of ketamine as a crisis intervention treatment for suicidal patients merit study. Areas that need research are outlined."

CL 1848C (Etoxadrol), a new compound of the dissociative group was given to 13 normal human volunteers, and this report deals with the behavior and neurophysiological observations made from this group. It was concluded that in cognitive or motor function tests, there was no change in rank order performance of the individuals in the post drug period as compared to their pre drug period, which served as a control. Psychological testing failed to reveal any evidence of personality derangement or evidence of toxicity from the drug. Psychological evaluation failed to reveal trauma to the psyche from the drug or from the design of the experiment. Electroencephalographic interpretation revealed an interesting and unusual feature of the drug, for all records remained essentially normal but changed from the awake pattern to a 'drowsy' or light sleep record without other evidence of drug imposition. Subject acceptance of the drug, in spite of almost universal reporting by the volunteers of unusual dreams or experiences, did not produce problems of serious magnitude in this study. This drug has been advanced to phase III clinical trials at six university medical centers and these results will be followed closely."
"136","0","Effect of attention bias modification (ABM) on chronic pain and associated health outcomes in Defence personnel.^
INTERVENTION: This study aims to determine whether multiple sessions of an ABM using pain cues will reduce attention bias to pain cues, reduce pain severity and related disability (e.g., pain interference) and improve mental health in ADF members (serving and ex‐serving) with chronic pain. The study will be a parallel‐groups randomized superiority trial comparing 5 sessions of ABM (using pain‐related word cue attention modification training via a modified dot‐probe task) versus sham training (i.e., placebo control condition, via a dot‐probe task) in Defence personnel who self‐report chronic pain experience lasting at least 3 months. The 2 arms include: 1. Behavioural: Attention bias modification (ABM) treatment Attention training using a computerized spatial attention task (dot‐probe, DPT) modified to alter pain‐related attention patterns using pain and neutral stimuli (with the probe placed in the opposite location to the pain stimuli). 2. Behavioural: Sham ABM placebo control condition Attention training using a computerized spatial attention task (dot‐probe) not intended to alter pain‐related attention patterns using the same pain and neutral stimuli (with the probe replacing the pain vs. neutral stimuli equally often). Stage 1: Participants will complete a series of online (or hard‐copy option upon request) validated questionnaires to assess baseline (and at post‐intervention) levels of key outcome and demographic variables. Participants will then be randomised to receive double‐blinded administration of either ABM or sham (placebo control) training. Stage 2: Participants attend 1 training session a week for 5 weeks (of ABM or sham training). Prior to the first training session and at the completion of the final training session, pre‐ and post‐intervention attention biases will be assessed, respectively, via a computerised visual probe task (<10 mins) where reaction times for different categories of pain words related to sensory and affective experiences will be measured. Participants are randomly allocated to receive either ABM or sham training, taking approximately 10 minutes each session (n = 50 each). *ABM, ‘away pain’ – in this condition, participants’ attention is implicitly re‐directed away from pain‐related cues (compared to neutral cues). This occurs via the placement of the dot probe in the opposite location of the pain cue on all trials. *Sham ABM control – participants’ attention is not trained toward or away from any stimuli type in this condition (i.e., similar to the assessment task, with the location of the dot probe replacing the pain cues 50% of the time). This condition serves as a placebo control group. During the 5‐week intervention period, a brief (5‐10 min) online survey will be completed the day following each training session to assess incremental changes in mood and pain ratings. Stage 3: Online questionnaires (or hard copy upon request) will be administered immediately and at 1‐month following the final training session to assess acute and sustained or delayed effects on key clinical outcome variables (e.g., pain, disability, negative affect). Session 1 includes pre‐intervention DPT assessment prior to ABM trials (20 min). Sessions 2‐4 include only ABM trials (10 min). Session 5 includes post‐intervention DPT assessment following the ABM trials (20 min). Each session includes instruction screens and practice trials using neutral stimuli. CONDITION: Chronic pain INCLUSION CRITERIA: Aged 18 years or older, currently serving or ex‐serving Defence member, have been experiencing pain for at least 3 months, and had this pain experience in the last few months The interventions are delivered face‐to‐face by trained research assistants (with postgraduate psychology qualifications) via the experiment presentation software, E‐prime 2.0, on laptop computers at a workstation (individual testing) in an office space or consulting room at the participant's local Defence base (e.g., local Barracks office space), local ex‐service orga isation, public library meeting room, or in a quiet room at one of the QUT campuses. All participant instructions for performing the dot probe task are contained within the program, such that the participant can read these at their own pace, pause to ask any questions of the research assistant before proceeding from the practice block to the intervention or assessment block. PRIMARY OUTCOME: Attention bias scores for pain‐related cues (vs. neutral cues), via reaction times from the dot‐probe task. Pain Intensity, assessed via the modified Brief Pain Inventory. Pain Interference, assessed via the modified Brief Pain Inventory. SECONDARY OUTCOME: Aggressive behaviour in the past month, assessed using 4 likert‐scaled items (“Never” to “Five or more times”) assessing frequency of different examples of aggressive behaviour with others. Amphetamines or ecstasy dependence, assessed using the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) items for amphetamines or ecstasy. Amphetamines or ecstasy frequency of use in past month, assessed via single item preceding the Severity of Dependence Scale (SDS) items for amphetamines or ecstasy.

"120","1","Can 'floating' predict treatment response to ketamine? Data from three randomized trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.^
Ketamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects (SEs). Recent studies noted a positive correlation between treatment response to ketamine and general dissociative SEs, as well as ""floating"", a depersonalization SE (a subtype of the dissociative SEs). This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine. Data were pooled from three double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder) received placebo and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions. SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion. The hypothesis that a post-infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post-infusion and at Day 1. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model. Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores (p < 0.0001), but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. The hypothesized mediation effect of floating was also not detected at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. Taken together, the findings do not support the hypothesis that ketamine's antidepressant effects are mediated by the dissociative depersonalization subtype SE of floating."
"9010","1","A comparison of two different doses of rectal ketamine added to 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine in infants and young children.^
In some circumstances, a high degree of sedation that results in a child being unconscious at the time of parental separation is desirable. We set out to investigate the efficacy and safety of a rectal premedication regimen designed to produce this increased level of sedation. Sixty-seven children aged two to 24 months were randomised into two groups. Group MK received 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine and group MKK received 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine per rectum. The sedation score at the time of parental separation 30 minutes after drug administration and the response to intravenous cannulation were evaluated on a four-point scale. Respiratory rate, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded immediately before parental separation. More patients in group MKK were asleep during separation (62 vs 35%, P < 0.05). Fewer patients in group MKK cried during intravenous cannulation (37 vs 68%, P < 0.05). Sedation scores were significantly increased at both time points. There was no difference between groups in vital signs at the time of parental separation and no adverse respiratory events occurred during the study period. In cases where a high degree of sedation following premedication in infants and toddlers is desired, the addition of 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine to 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine administered rectally is more efficacious than 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine."

Objective: To determine physicians' knowledge of urine drug testing and usual practices when performing drug testing on adolescent patients at a time when interest in drug testing of adolescents is on the rise and physicians may be consulted for advice and requests to perform tests. Design and Participants: Multimodal survey conducted April to July 2004 consisting of 42 forced-choice response items. Participants were practicing physicians randomly selected from the national membership rolls of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of Adolescent Medicine, and American Academy of Family Physicians who provided care for 10 or more adolescents per week. We computed simple frequencies and sample design-adjusted 95% confidence intervals for each item. Results: The survey was completed by 359 eligible physicians ( response rate, 42%). More than 95% of respondents had ever ordered urine drug tests. Only 23% used an effective urine sample collection procedure, and only 7% used specific gravity and measurement of urine creatinine level to ensure validity of the sample, as recommended. When asked which drugs can be detected in routine panels, only 10% answered all items correctly, 47% did not know for 1 or more items, and 75% responded incorrectly for 1 or more items. Conclusions: Primary care physicians do not always use proper urine sample collection and validation procedures, and they are not aware of important limitations of drug testing. The primary care workforce is not prepared to assist with drug testing programs. Physicians who order these tests need more training and access to consultation with experts."
"9459","0","A dose-response analysis of the subjective, psychomotor and physiological effects of intravenous morphine in healthy volunteers.^
The purpose of this study was to characterize the subjective, psychomotor and physiological effects of morphine in healthy volunteers. Subjects (10 males and 2 females) without histories of opiate dependence were injected in an antecubetal vein with 0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/70 kg of morphine, by using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Subjective effects, psychomotor performance and physiological measures were assessed immediately before the injection and for up to 5 hr afterward. Morphine increased the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, Amphetamine, the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide and the Morphine-Benzedrine Group scores and decreased Benzedrine Group scores on the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Increased visual analog scale ratings of ""stimulated,"" ""high,"" ""sedated,"" ""coasting or spaced out"" and ""drunken"" were also obtained. On an opiate adjective checklist, subjects reported increased ratings of ""flushing,"" ""dry mouth"" and ""tingling."" Drug liking was not significantly altered by morphine, but there was substantial intersubject variability with this measure. Some aspects of psychomotor performance (reaction time, Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Maddox Wing) were impaired by morphine; however, eye-hand coordination was not. Miosis was induced by morphine. Most effects of morphine were dose-related, some effects peaked soon after morphine injection (e.g., increased stimulated and high ratings) and dissipated gradually, whereas other effects did not peak until later into the session (sedation or exophoria). Our results are fairly consistent with other studies examining morphine effects in healthy volunteers, and also indicate that the profile of morphine effects differ between healthy volunteers and those with a history of opiate dependence."
"1278","1","Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^
Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others."
"7126","1","Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^
Rationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag."
"7009","0","Effects of ketamine optical isomers, psilocybin, psilocin and norpsilocin on time estimation and cognition in rats.^
Rationale Ketamine and psilocybin belong to the rapid-acting antidepressants but they also produce psychotomimetic effects including timing distortion. It is currently debatable whether these are essential for their therapeutic actions. As depressed patients report that the ""time is dragging,"" we hypothesized that ketamine and psilocybin-like compounds may produce an opposite effect, i.e., time underestimation, purportedly contributing to their therapeutic properties. Objectives Timing was tested following administration of (R)- and (S)-ketamine, and psilocybin, psilocin, and norpsilocin in the discrete-trial temporal discrimination task (TDT) in male rats. Timing related to premature responses, and cognitive and unspecific effects of compounds were tested in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in the standard 1-s, and ""easier"" 2-s stimulus duration conditions, as well as in the vITI variant promoting impulsive responses. Results (S)-ketamine (15 but not 3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg) shifted psychometric curve to the right in TDT and reduced premature responses in 5-CSRTT, suggesting expected time underestimation, but it also decreased the accuracy of temporal discrimination and increased response and reward latencies, decreased correct responses, and increased incorrect responses. While (R)-ketamine did not affect timing and produced no unspecific actions, it reduced incorrect responses in TDT and increased accuracy in 5-CSRTT, suggesting pro-cognitive effects. Psilocin and psilocybin produced mainly unspecific effects in both tasks, while norpsilocin showed no effects. Conclusions Time underestimation produced by (S)-ketamine could be associated with its antidepressant effects; however, it was accompanied with severe behavioral disruption. We also hypothesize that behavioral disruption produced by psychedelics objectively reflects their psychotomimetic-like actions."
"3592","1","The rapid anti-suicidal ideation effect of ketamine: A systematic review.^
In many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years-presenting a public health crisis. Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness, usually a depressive disorder. Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA-approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks-thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [SI] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome. A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] criteria. PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline. One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post-dose. Further research is warranted into: optimal dosing strategy, including number and frequency; and long-term efficacy and safety. Ultimately, it remains to be shown that ketamine's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior."

Administered the Defense Mechanism Test (DMT) to 31 psychiatric inpatients and 14 control Ss. The patient group was divided according to the following diagnoses: borderline personality disorder (BPD), other personality disorders (OPDs), and schizophrenic disorder (SD). Significant differences were found in DMT responses between the 4 groups. BPD Ss were characterized by frequent expression of emotions, especially different variants of introaggression, which in the context of the DMT is interpreted as an expression of depression. Regarding the SD and OPDs groups, a pattern of high threshold values for perception and different variants of introjection emerged as characteristic. The control group was distinguished by very few DMT distortions. Results indicate that the DMT and partial least squares discriminant analysis are powerful methods for assessing personality pathology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"9249","0","Could psychedelic drugs have a role in the treatment of schizophrenia? Rationale and strategy for safe implementation.^
Schizophrenia is a widespread psychiatric disorder that affects 0.5-1.0% of the world's population and induces significant, long-term disability that exacts high personal and societal cost. Negative symptoms, which respond poorly to available antipsychotic drugs, are the primary cause of this disability. Association of negative symptoms with cortical atrophy and cell loss is widely reported. Psychedelic drugs are undergoing a significant renaissance in psychiatric disorders with efficacy reported in several conditions including depression, in individuals facing terminal cancer, posttraumatic stress disorder, and addiction. There is considerable evidence from preclinical studies and some support from human studies that psychedelics enhance neuroplasticity. In this Perspective, we consider the possibility that psychedelic drugs could have a role in treating cortical atrophy and cell loss in schizophrenia, and ameliorating the negative symptoms associated with these pathological manifestations. The foremost concern in treating schizophrenia patients with psychedelic drugs is induction or exacerbation of psychosis. We consider several strategies that could be implemented to mitigate the danger of psychotogenic effects and allow treatment of schizophrenia patients with psychedelics to be implemented. These include use of non-hallucinogenic derivatives, which are currently the focus of intense study, implementation of sub-psychedelic or microdosing, harnessing of entourage effects in extracts of psychedelic mushrooms, and blocking 5-HT2A receptor-mediated hallucinogenic effects. Preclinical studies that employ appropriate animal models are a prerequisite and clinical studies will need to be carefully designed on the basis of preclinical and translational data. Careful research in this area could significantly impact the treatment of one of the most severe and socially debilitating psychiatric disorders and open an exciting new frontier in psychopharmacology."
"6566","1","How does ayahuasca work from a psychiatric perspective? Pros and cons of the entheogenic therapy.^
OBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant preparation, traditionally consumed in sacred ceremonies by indigenous North-Westerner Amazonian countries like Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should be carried out in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, by implementing neuroimaging studies, in order to better evaluate therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in mental disorders."

Personality characteristics have been linked to substance use, however research on the association between personality and MDMA use is scarce. This study examined differences on Big Five personality dimensions between a population sample of non-hard drug using Dutch adolescents and young adults (n = 265), and a sample of young people visiting house parties, including both MDMA- and non-MDMA-users (n = 541). Results showed that 71% of the party visitors indicated using MDMA. Group differences were found on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism-emotional stability, but not on resourcefulness-openness to experience. Compared to the non-hard drug using National respondents, MDMA-using party visitors reported higher levels of extraversion and both MDMA and non-MDMA-using partygoers showed less conscientiousness. Non-MDMA-using partygoers reported less agreeableness and emotional stability than National Sample respondents.

Early geographic relocation has been implicated as an important correlate of psychopathology, learning difficulties, and behavioural problems among child and adolescent populations, yet systematic studies of the potential influence of relocation on youthful drug use have not been conducted. This study explored the relationship between number of geographic moves before the age of 16 and the timing of onset of drug use and progression to drug-related problems. Data were obtained from 3,700 young adults aged 18 to 35 years participating in the 1990-1991 Ontario Mental Health Supplement, a large random probability survey of the residents of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Holding constant potential confounding factors, results showed highly significant positive relationships between moving and early initiation of illicit drugs including marijuana, hallucinogens, crack/cocaine, and illicit use of prescribed drugs. Among marijuana users, moving was also associated with a hastening of time to marijuana-related problems. Relationships between moving and measures of alcohol use/problems (onset of first drink, onset of any alcohol-related problem) were either weak or nonsignificant. Important sex differences were found, with statistically significant relationships between moving and early drug use initiation and progression occurring primarily among males. Future research is required to test for possible mediating mechanisms linking relocation with drug use as well as moderating influences. Efforts should also focus on finding out why drug use appears to be a more common response to relocation among boys."
"2988","1","Low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) increase reward-related brain activity.^
Renewed interest in classic psychedelics as treatments for psychiatric disorders warrants a deeper understanding of their neural mechanisms. Single, high doses of psychedelic drugs have shown promise in treating depressive disorders, perhaps by reversing deficits in reward processing in the brain. In addition, there are anecdotal reports that repeated ingestion of low doses of LSD, or ""microdosing"", improve mood, cognition, and feelings of wellbeing. However, the effects of low doses of classic psychedelics on reward processing have not been studied. The current study examined the effects of two single, low doses of LSD compared to placebo on measures of reward processing. Eighteen healthy adults completed three sessions in which they received placebo (LSD-0), 13 μg LSD (LSD-13) and 26 μg LSD (LSD-26) in a within-subject, double-blind design. Neural activity was recorded while participants completed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. Event-related potentials were measured during feedback processing (Reward-Positivity: RewP, Feedback-P3: FB-P3, and Late-Positive Potential: LPP). Compared to placebo, LSD-13 increased RewP and LPP amplitudes for reward (vs. neutral) feedback, and LSD-13 and LSD-26 increased FB-P3 amplitudes for positive (vs. negative) feedback. These effects were unassociated with most subjective measures of drug effects. Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of depressive disorders."
"2724","1","Superstitious conditioning as a model of delusion formation following chronic but not acute ketamine in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has previously been shown to induce delusion-like or referential beliefs, both acutely in healthy volunteers and naturalistically among nonintoxicated users of the drug. Delusions are theoretically underpinned by increased superstitious conditioning or the erroneous reinforcement of random events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a novel and objectively measured superstitious conditioning task, experiment 1 assessed healthy volunteers before and during placebo (n = 16), low-dose (n = 15), and high-dose ketamine (n = 16) under randomized and double-blind conditions. Experiment 2 used the same task to compare ketamine users (n = 18), polydrug controls (n = 19), and nondrug-using controls (n = 17). RESULTS: In experiment 1, ketamine produced dose-dependent psychotomimetic effects but did not cause changes in superstitious conditioning. Experiment 2 found increased levels of superstitious conditioning among ketamine users compared to polydrug and nondrug-using controls, respectively, as evidenced by both objective task responses and subjective beliefs following the task. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that chronic but not acute exposure to ketamine may increase the propensity to adopt superstitious conditioning. These findings are discussed in terms of acute and chronic ketamine models of delusion-like belief formation in schizophrenia."
"5357","1","Trends in ecstasy use in the United States from 1995 to 2001: Comparison with marijuana users and association with other drug use.^
This study aims to estimate changes in the prevalence of ecstasy use over time, analyze the overlap of ecstasy use and other drug use, and compare other drug use in ecstasy versus marijuana users. The authors hypothesized that ecstasy users early in the ""epidemic"" would be polydrug users and that associations between ecstasy and other drug use would diminish as the prevalence of ecstasy use increased. Data were drawn from public use data files from the 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Ecstasy use increased in the U.S. population and the prevalence was greater in younger age groups. Ecstasy users were likely to use a variety of other drugs; however, association of ecstasy use with other drug use was strongest early in the ""epidemic,"" diminishing as the number of new users increased. Later, more drug-naive adolescents and young adults began experimenting with ecstasy. These results can orient prevention strategies that target ecstasy users.

"8679","1","Prospective examination of synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine inhalation: effects on salivary IL-6, cortisol levels, affect, and non-judgment.^
RATIONALE: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a psychotropic substance found in various plant and animal species and is synthetically produced. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is used in naturalistic settings for spiritual exploration, recreation, or to address negative affect and mood problems. However, scientific knowledge on the effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to assess the effects of inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine on neuroendocrine markers. The second objective was to assess effects of the substance on affect and mindfulness. In addition, we assessed whether ratings of subjective measures were associated with changes in stress biomarkers (i.e., cortisol) and immune response (i.e., IL-6, CRP, IL-1β), as well as the acute psychedelic experience. METHODS: Assessments (baseline, immediately post-session, and 7-day follow-up) were made in 11 participants. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and post-session and analyzed by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased IL-6 concentrations in saliva immediately post-session. These changes were not correlated to ratings of mental health or the psychedelic experience. Relative to baseline, ratings of non-judgment significantly increased, and ratings of depression decreased immediately post-session and at follow-up. Ratings of anxiety and stress decreased from baseline to 7-day follow-up. Participant ratings of the psychedelic experience correlated negatively with ratings of affect and positively with ratings of non-judgment. CONCLUSION: Inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced significant changes in inflammatory markers, improved affect, and non-judgment in volunteers. Future research should examine the effect of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamineamine with healthy volunteers in a controlled laboratory setting."

Comments on an article by Thomas D. Hull et al. (see record [rid]2022-90673-008[/rid]). As noted by the authors, the paper does not report any efficacy or safety outcomes for at least 1573 (55.8 %) of the 2848 patients who appeared to have started the at-home ketamine treatment protocol. Why were so many patients excluded from the analysis? No explanation or breakdown is provided. The authors list at least 13 exclusion criteria for this report; do these criteria apply to the administration of at-home ketamine or just to the analysis of the patients in this report?.The authors state in the discussion that 'review of EHR for those excluded due to missing follow-up measures did not reveal any differences in rates of cancellation, dropout, or adverse events.'The authors report a response and remission rates of 62.8 % and 32.6 %, respectively, following 4 sessions of at-home ketamine. This concern is amplified when the authors attempt to make comparisons with other reports that used much more rigorous forms of data collection. Again, we applaud the authors' attempts at reporting real-world data and the journal for the willingness to publish this form of data; the field needs more of this. However, we also point out that the report did not show that the protocol was safe nor effective. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"

"5468","1","Positron emission tomographic studies of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in abstinent (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""ecstasy"") users: Relationship to cognitive performance.^
Background: (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is a recreational drug and brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. Under certain conditions, MDMA can also damage brain dopamine (DA) neurons, at least in rodents. Human MDMA users have been found to have reduced brain 5-HT transporter (SERT) density and cognitive deficits, although it is not known whether these are related. This study sought to determine whether MDMA users who take closely spaced sequential doses, which engender high plasma MDMA concentrations, develop DA transporter (DAT) deficits, in addition to SERT deficits, and whether there is a relationship between transporter binding and cognitive performance. Materials and methods: Sixteen abstinent MDMA users with a history of using sequential MDMA doses (two or more doses over a 3- to 12-h period) and 16 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls participated. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the DAT and SERT radioligands, [11C]WIN 35,428 and [11C]DASB, respectively. Subjects also underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing. Results: MDMA users had reductions in SERT binding in multiple brain regions but no reductions in striatal DAT binding. Memory performance in the aggregate subject population was correlated with SERT binding in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, brain regions implicated in memory function. Prior exposure to MDMA significantly diminished the strength of this relationship. Conclusions: Use of sequential MDMA doses is associated with lasting decreases in brain SERT, but not DAT. Memory performance is associated with SERT binding in brain regions involved in memory function. Prior MDMA exposure appears to disrupt this relationship. These data are the first to directly relate memory performance to brain SERT density. © 2008 Springer-Verlag."
"5946","1","Evaluation of the neuroprotective effects of S(+)-ketamine during open-heart surgery.^
We compared the effect of S(+)-ketamine to remifentanil, both in combination with propofol, on the neurocognitive outcome after open-heart surgery in 106 patients. A battery of neurocognitive tests was administered before surgery and 1 and 10 wk after surgery. Fourteen patients (25%) in the control group and 10 patients (20%) in the S(+)-ketamine group had 2 or more tests with a cognitive deficit (decline by at least one preoperative SD of that test in all patients) 10 wk after surgery (P = 0.54). Z-scores were calculated for all tests. No significantly better performance could be detected in the S(+)-ketamine group, except for the Trailmaking B test 10 wk after surgery. We conclude that S(+)-ketamine offers no greater neuroprotection compared with remifentanil during open-heart surgery. IMPLICATIONS: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors play an important role during ischemic brain injury. We could not demonstrate that S(+)-ketamine resulted in greater neuroprotective effects compared with remifentanil during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures when both were combined with propofol."

Background and Objectives - The literature suggests that S(+) ketamine is more potent and has less psychedelic effects as compared to its racemic formulation. This study aimed at comparing psychedelic, hemodynamic, analgesic and anesthetic effects of racemic ketamine versus S(+) ketamine. Methods - Participated in this study 36 adult patients premedicated with midazolam. Fentanyl was administered in the operating room (3 μg.kg-1) followed by a 2 mg.kg-1 bolus of racemic ketamine and continuous infusion (2 mg.kg-1.h-1) for Group Keta-R. Group (+) Keta received a bolus administration of 1 mg.kg-1 racemic ketamine followed by continuous infusion (1 mg.kg-1.h-1). Intravenous atracurium (0.25 mg.kg-1) was administered after loss of eyelid reflex being then increased to 0.5 mg.kg-1 for tracheal intubation. Propofol or inhalational anesthetics were used at the sole judgment of the anesthesiologist. Neuromuscular block, inhalational anesthetics consumption, perioperative analgesia, psychedelic effects including dreams and nightmares, visual and concentration alterations were evaluated by an independent observer. Results - Group (+) Keta required more propofol during anesthesia induction. Mean inhalational anesthetics consumption was higher for Group (+) Keta. Group (+) Keta was more sensitive to needle prickling and took longer to ask for analgesics as compared to Group Keta-R. Seven Group Keta-R patients and 1 Group (+) Keta patient presented with visual alterations. Group (+) Keta patients had better concentration (p=0,0033) and a lower incidence of dreams. Conclusions - S(+) ketamine provided for a better analgesia without psychedelic effects as compared to racemic ketamine."
"1456","1","Effect of Low Dose of Ketamine on Learning Memory Function in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy-A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Clinical Study.^
OBJECTIVES: Converging evidence suggests that low doses of ketamine have antidepressant effects. The feasibility and safety of administering low doses of ketamine as adjunctive medication during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to enhance ECT efficacy and mitigate cognitive impairment has attracted much attention. This study investigated the effects of low doses of ketamine on learning and memory in patients undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study recruited patients with moderate to severe depressive disorders who failed to respond to antidepressants and were scheduled to receive ECT. Participants were randomly assigned to a study group, which received an intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia, and a control group, which received isovolumetric placebo (normal saline) and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of depression after ECT. Before and after the ECT course, the Mini-mental State Examination and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision were used to assess global cognitive and learning and memory functions, respectively. Psychotropic effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Vital signs and other adverse events were recorded for each ECT procedure. RESULTS: Of 132 patients recruited, 66 were assigned to each group; 63 patients in study groups and 64 patients in the control group completed the ECT course during the study. Afterward, the incidence of global cognitive impairment in the control group was higher than it was in the study group. In addition, the decline in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision scale was greater in the control group than in the study group. The necessary ECT treatment times were shorter in the study group than in the control group (8 [7, 9] vs 9 [8, 10]). No significant escalations of the positive Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores or adverse events were observed in the study group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunctive medication, ketamine can attenuate learning and memory impairment, especially for short-term memory, caused by ECT performed under propofol anesthesia. Ketamine can also reduce ECT treatment times during the therapy course without inducing significant adverse effects."

RATIONALE: Salvinorin A (SA) is a highly selective kappa opioid receptor agonist and the putative psychoactive compound in Salvia divinorum (SD), an increasingly abused hallucinogenic plant. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the physiological and subjective effects of SA versus placebo and measure drug and metabolite levels. METHODS: Sublingual SA doses up to 4 mg were administered in dimethyl sulfoxide/polyethylene glycol 400 solution to eight SD-experienced subjects using a placebo-controlled ascending-dose design. RESULTS: No dose of SA produced significantly greater physiological or subjective effects than placebo. Furthermore, effects did not resemble reported ""typical"" effects of smoked SD. SA was detectable in plasma and urine, but was, in most cases, below the reliable limit of quantification (0.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the sublingual bioavailability of SA is low. Higher doses, alternate formulations, or alternate routes of administration will be necessary to study the effects of SA in humans."

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a large health concern, and one third have a treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). This has consequences for the affected individual, and is associated with a significant economic burden on our society. Despite the large public health impact, the there are few new major breakthroughs in pharmacological agents since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the 1980's. The N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, with intravenous (IV) administration demonstrating rapid antidepressant effects and striking response rates. Recently the results from the first clinical trial of intranasal esketamine, which is the more potent Senantiomer of ketamine, as adjunctive to antidepressants in TRD was reported (Daly et al, 2017). The study was a randomized, double‐blind trial including 67 participants with TRD, who continued their existing antidepressant treatment. The results show that twice weekly administration of esketamine has a significant effect on depressive symptoms (MADRS) as early as 1 week of treatment. Another interesting aspect of the study was the use of intranasal drug delivery, which is receiving increasing attention in psychiatry (Quintana et al. 2016). The previous findings of antidepressant effect are mainly based on IV administration. This limits the use of Esketamine in outpatient clinics and primary care. Intranasal administration also increases bioavailability compared to oral administration, due to the avoidance of first pass liver metabolism."
"4661","1","Epidemiology of classic psychedelic substances: results from a Norwegian internet convenience sample.^
OBJECTIVE: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in investigating the use of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, knowledge about the epidemiology of classic psychedelics in the Nordic countries is limited. METHODS: We recruited adult, Norwegian participants who have had a memorable experience after taking a classic psychedelic substance. They filled in an anonymous internet survey with 119 items covering matters related to recreational use of psychedelics using a secure, web-based application. Data are presented by using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations). RESULTS: We recruited 841 participants, 770 (72% male; 88% 45 years or younger) of which were included in the data analysis. The intentions behind taking the psychedelic substance were mainly recreational (46.1%) or therapeutic (42.3%). Most participants reported that their most memorable experience was with psilocybin. As in modern era clinical trials, most participants were well-prepared before, did processing during, and did integration work after the experience, whereas only a minority were supported by a therapist. Self-perceived symptoms of various mental disorders and substance use disorders were prevalent in the sample. Most subjects reported improvements in their condition. Although adverse reactions were usually mild and short-lived, 4.2% lasted for 1 year or more. Persisting flashbacks were present for a year or more among 2.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional sample of Norwegian, self-selecting adults, we shed light on what characterizes the most memorable experience with a classic psychedelic substance, including short- and long-term risks and benefits. For the most part, the psychedelic experience led to improvements in self-perceived symptoms of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, a small subset experienced persisting adverse reactions."

AIM: To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. DESIGN: Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4‐week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention‐to‐treat. SETTING: Two specialist, out‐patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8‐day withdrawal episode, participants could self‐select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). MEASUREMENTS: Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. FINDINGS: The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3‐8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4‐18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 +/‐ 2.5 versus 4.5 +/‐ 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1‐2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/‐ 8.2 versus 14.6 +/‐ 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8‐9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is effective for short‐term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications."
"641","1","Psilocybin in long-term meditators: effects on default mode network functional connectivity and retrospective ratings of qualitative experience.^
Aims: Descriptions of meditation experiences can bear striking similarity to descriptions of some experiences with classic (serotonergic) hallucinogens. Neuroimaging studies reveal striking overlap in the effects of psilocybin and the effects of meditation on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). This ongoing study explored the effects of psilocybin on subjective experience and DMN connectivity in long‐term meditators. Methods: 16 meditators (mean lifetime meditation = 4206 h) received either a placebo (n = 8) or a high dose psilocybin (n = 8) capsule before a laboratory session. Retrospective self‐report measures of subjective experience and resting‐state fMRI data were collected the day after the session. Seed‐based functional connectivity analyses were applied to fMRI data. Self‐report measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups. Results: Participants who received psilocybin attributed significantly greater meaning, spiritual significance, psychological challenge, and psychological insight to their session experiences than those who received placebo. 75% of participants in the psilocybin group rated the experience to be in the top 10 most meaningful experiences of their life. Participants who received psilocybin also showed lower functional connectivity between hippocampal and posterior DMN regions and greater functional connectivity among DMN regions than those who received placebo. Conclusions: Participants attributed substantial meaning to their high‐dose psilocybin experience, andshowedchanges in brain function the day after a high dose of psilocybin. Further research should explore the relationship of these enduring changes in brain function to abuse liability and therapeutic outcomes with psilocybin."
"579","1","Ketamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^
INTRODUCTION: First-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes exposure and response prevention behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly in combination. New and more effective treatments are needed, give that recent studies suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of the disorder. In these circumstances, ketamine, as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and glutamate modulator, offers alternative possibilities for OCD treatment. METHODS: This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of ketamine in OCD, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). Searches were carried out using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. RESULTS: Nine articles were included, of which three were randomized controlled trials, three case reports, two open-label trials, and one a retrospective chart review. Reported data have shown a potential for fast onset of action and good tolerability of ketamine for OCD, even though the principal studies used only single-session racemic ketamine treatments, administered intravenously, and the results have been erratic. In addition, none of the available evidence demonstrates whether racemic ketamine, S-ketamine, or R-ketamine has the best efficacy in controlling OCD symptoms, and only sparse evidence suggests that a combination of ketamine and psychotherapy could benefit patients with OCD. CONCLUSION: In order to advance clinical practice regarding the use of ketamine in treating OCD, future randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are required. These trials need to use larger samples to explore ketamine and its enantiomers, with different methods of administration, multiple sessions, and appropriate washout periods."
"3489","0","Methodological problems of clinical trials of psychotropic drugs.^
Up to now, clinical studies only succeeded in differentiating between great categories of psychotropic drugs, but failed to prove finer differences of effects within these categories of substances. Two points of the testing method are discussed: problems which arise when rating pathological behaviour problems of sampling psychiatric patients. A great part of symptoms that clinicians and psychologists used to consider as relevant proved to be extremely rare. Total scores cannot be taken as a measure of the therapeutic effect, because they don't adequately express the degree of severity of the illness before and after treatment, and there is a parameter of symptoms that is independent from the observer, i.e., the frequency of the symptom in different clinical pictures. The frequency is an inverse ratio to the specifity of the symptom. It is then argued that even in clinical studies, it would be possible to choose among the variety of descriptive symptoms, those which fulfil requirements of the probabilistic test model of Rasch and to take only those symptoms to characterize the degree of severity of psychic disturbance in trials with psychotropic drugs. Conclusions are then drawn from a study including three groups of physicians (specialists for internal diseases, psychiatrists and general practitioners): failure to differentiate between placebo and a minor tranquilizer was not due to the inefficiency of the drug, but ought to be attributed to the lack of sharpness of the observations made by untrained judges. A significant difference between placebo and the minor tranquilizer was yet found, but only in the group of psychiatrists. The comparison of the first 13 and the last 13 cases in the two remaining groups, however, reveals a learning process in the course of the study. The main problems of sampling are discussed, i.e.: the loss of information as a consequence of taking the mean in a group of psychiatric patients, the role of biological rhythms, which was hitherto insufficiently considered, and finally it is demonstrated in connection with two selected cases of depressive patients that enormous differences of psychophysiological responsiveness can be hidden behind very similar clinical pictures. It is pointed out that the existing research strategy is adjusted to great samples, which were composed on the basis of behavioral characteristics, and that it failed to differentiate subtle effects of psychotropic drugs. Only experiments involving a much greater display, which take into account all aspects of observation of the selected single cases and longitudinal studies can answer the question as to which is the right medicine for the patient. Psychophysiological and biochemical methods have priority over other methods."
"2084","0","A clinical approach to treatment resistance in depressed patients: What to do when the usual treatments don't work well enough?.^
Background Major depressive disorder is a common, recurrent, disabling and costly disorder that is often severe and/or chronic, and for which non-remission on guideline concordant first-line antidepressant treatment is the norm. A sizeable percentage of patients diagnosed with MDD do not achieve full remission after receiving antidepressant treatment. How to understand or approach these 'refractory', 'TRD' or 'difficult to treat' patients need to be revisited. Treatment resistant depression (TRD) has been described elsewhere as failure to respond to adequate treatment by two different antidepressants. This definition is problematic as it suggests that TRD is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), inferring a boundary between TRD and depression that is not treatment resistant. However, there is scant evidence to suggest that a discrete TRD entity exists as a distinct subtype of MDD, which itself is not a discrete or homogeneous entity. Similarly, the boundary between TRD and other forms of depression is predicated at least in part on regulatory and research requirements rather than biological evidence or clinical utility. Aim This paper aims to investigate the notion of treatment failure in order to understand (i) what is TRD in the context of a broader formulation based on the understanding of depression, (ii) what factors make an individual patient difficult to treat, and (iii) what is the appropriate and individualised treatment strategy, predicated on an individual with refractory forms of depression? Method Expert contributors to this paper were sought internationally by contacting representatives of key professional societies in the treatment of MDD - World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry, Australasian Society for Bipolar and Depressive Disorders, International Society for Affective Disorders, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologium and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. The manuscript was prepared through iterative editing. Outcomes The concept of TRD as a discrete subtype of MDD, defined by failure to respond to pharmacotherapy, is not supported by evidence. Between 15 and 30% of depressive episodes fail to respond to adequate trials of 2 antidepressants, and 68% of individuals do not achieve remission from depression after a first-line course of antidepressant treatment. Failure to respond to antidepressant treatment, somatic therapies or psychotherapies may often reflect other factors including; biological resistance, diagnostic error, limitations of current therapies, psychosocial variables, a past history of exposure to childhood maltreatment or abuse, job satisfaction, personality disorders, co-morbid mental and physical disorders, substance use or non-adherence to treatment. Only a subset of patients not responding to antidepressant treatment can be explained through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. We propose that non remitting MDD should be personalised, and propose a strategy of 'deconstructing depression'. By this approach, the clinician considers which factors contribute to making this individual both depressed and 'resistant' to previous therapeutic approaches. Clinical formulation is required to understand the nature of the depression. Many predictors of response are not biological, and reflect a confluence of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, which may influence the illness in a particular individual. After deconstructing depression at a personalised level, a personalised treatment plan can be constructed. The treatment plan needs to address the factors that have contributed to the individual's hard to treat depression. In addition, an individual with a history of illness may have a lot of accumulated life issues due to consequences of their illness, and these should be addressed in a recovery plan. Limitations A 'deconstructing depression' qualitative rubric does not easily provide clear inclusion and exclusion criteria for researchers wanting to investigate TRD. Conclusions MDD is a polymorphic disorder and many individuals who fail to respond to standard pharmacotherapy and are considered hard to treat. These patients are best served by personalised approaches that deconstruct the factors that have contributed to the patient's depression and implementing a treatment plan that adequately addresses these factors. The existence of TRD as a discrete and distinct subtype of MDD, defined by two treatment failures, is not supported by evidence."
"5182","0","Prevalence of recent illicit substance use and reporting bias among MSM and other urban males.^
This paper explores whether elevated rates of self-reported substance use among MSM compared to other males may be an artifact of reporting bias. Past month prevalence rates of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and Ketamine use were compared between a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM), and a general household sample of men, all residing in Chicago. We compared rates of self-reported use, and corrected rates based on the results of drug testing (urine and oral fluid tests). While MSM over 30 years old were significantly more likely than other men in this age group to report past month use of cocaine, test-corrected rates of use were equivalent. On the other hand, test-corrected estimates confirmed elevated rates of Ketamine and Ecstasy use in the MSM sample. Differential disclosure of substance use between MSM and other males may in some cases lead to distorted conclusions about differences in substance use between these groups. The use of biological testing in epidemiological studies of substance use can reduce the uncertainty of such comparisons. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"8249","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during response inhibition.^
INTRODUCTION: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Inhibitory deficits in the schizophrenia spectrum have been reliably reported using the antisaccade task. Interestingly, although similar antisaccade deficits have been reported following ketamine in non-human primates, ketamine-induced deficits have not been observed in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function during an antisaccade task, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on n = 15 healthy males. We measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and eye movements during a mixed antisaccade/prosaccade task while participants received a subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (target plasma level 100 ng/ml) on one occasion and placebo on the other occasion. RESULTS: While ketamine significantly increased self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences, it did not induce antisaccade or prosaccade performance deficits. At the level of BOLD, we observed an interaction between treatment and task condition in somatosensory cortex, suggesting recruitment of additional neural resources in the antisaccade condition under NMDAR blockage. DISCUSSION: Given the robust evidence of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia spectrum populations, the current findings suggest that ketamine may not mimic all features of psychosis at the dose used in this study. Our findings underline the importance of a more detailed research to further understand and define effects of NMDAR hypofunction on human brain function and behavior, with a view to applying ketamine administration as a model system of psychosis. Future studies with varying doses will be of importance in this context."
"8483","1","Lack of effect of ketamine on cortical glutamate and glutamine in healthy volunteers: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.^
Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist that has been associated with temporary clinical improvement in patients with depression. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have shown that major depression is associated with decreased levels of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) in the anterior cingulate cortex, which normalize with clinical recovery. The present study aimed to test whether a ketamine infusion would increase cortical Glx levels in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers received an intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg kg⁻¹, n = 8) or saline (n = 9) over 40 minutes. MRS measurements were obtained at baseline, during, and at the end of the infusion. The infusion of ketamine had significant effects on mental state but there was no effect of ketamine on the levels of Glx (F (3,39) = 1.70, p = 0.18) or glutamate (F (3,39) = 48, p = 0.70). This study suggests that the gradual infusion of low-dose ketamine in antidepressant doses not cause changes in cortical glutamate or glutamine in healthy volunteers that are visible by proton MRS."

However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function."

Studied the effect of minute amounts of dextro-lysergic acid diethyl amide (d-LSD-25) on biofeedback training and other therapies used to effect change in the EEG and seizure susceptibility of epileptics and on learning and memory. 685 mice were randomly assigned to groups by split-litter design. Facilitation of learning, reduction of seizure susceptibility, and memory effects were found in Ss treated with intraperitoneal d-LSD-25. Results are discussed in reference to the reported effects of LSD on human behavior. The physiological mechanisms underlying the effect of d-LSD-25 on brain function is explicated and compared with the amphetamines in its capacity to facilitate learning and memory.

"6643","1","The effects of psilocybin on brain EEG activity and connectivity in healthy volunteers-focus on the dynamics of the psychedelic state.^
Introduction.‐ A serotonin 5‐HT2A/C agonist, psychedelic drug psilocybin, is gaining attention as a potential therapeutic tool for anxiety and depression. Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28‐50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale “altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)” at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

"8187","1","Psychedelics and Hallucinogens in Psychiatry: Finding New Pharmacological Targets.^
BACKGROUND: The therapeutic options for neurobehavioral disorders are still limited, and in many cases, they lack a satisfactory balance between efficacy and side effects. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to review current evidence regarding the potential contribution of psychedelics and hallucinogens to the discovery of new drugs for treating different psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: Ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin have evidence supporting their use in depression, and psilocybin and ayahuasca have also shown good results in treatment-resistant depression. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with anxious patients, there were symptomatic improvements with psilocybin and LSD. Psilocybin diminished Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in a small obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) sample. The evidence is less robust regarding substance use disorders, but it suggests a possible role for LSD and psilocybin in alcohol use disorders and for psilocybin in tobacco addiction. In a clinical setting, these substances seem to be safe and well-tolerated. Their mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, but there seems to be a preponderant role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 2A agonism, as well as connectivity changes within the default mode network (DMN) and amygdala and some other molecular modifications. CONCLUSION: The studies underlying the conclusions have small samples and are heterogeneous in their methods. However, the results suggest that the use of psychedelics and hallucinogens could be considered in some disorders. More studies are needed to reinforce their evidence as potential new drugs."

INTRODUCTION: The aim of this study was to investigate the pattern of recreational drug use in patients attending a genitourinary medicine clinic, and to determine whether drug use was greater among men who have sex with men (MSM) patients, when compared to non-MSM male patients. METHODS: A questionnaire was given to all patients attending the genitourinary medicine clinics at two inner city teaching hospitals over 3 months (July to September 2011). The questionnaire was self-completed by patients while waiting to be seen by a clinician. Data were collected on age, gender, gender of sexual partner(s), and previous/current recreational drug use (type/frequency of drugs used). Only data from male respondents have been analysed in this paper. RESULTS: 1328 questionnaires were completed. Of the male respondents (n=729), 475 (65.2%) were identified as non-MSM and 254 (34.8%) were identified as MSM. The mean ± SD age of male respondents was 31 ± 9 years years. Lifetime and last month use of mephedrone, ketamine, volatile nitrites ('poppers'), sildenafil (Viagra), GHB, and GBL were all significantly higher in the MSM group compared to the non-MSM group. Lifetime use of cocaine powder, MDMA, amphetamine, and methamphetamine were also significantly higher in the MSM group; however, there was no significant difference in last month use of these drugs between MSM and non-MSM groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both lifetime and last month use of most recreational drugs was more common in MSM, when compared to non-MSM males. Sexual health clinics may provide an opportunistic encounter to identify patterns of recreational drug use, explore motivations for use, and implement strategies to reduce harms related to drug use. This will require a multidisciplinary approach to address the psychosocial aspects of drug taking behaviours, in combination with healthcare professionals experienced in the management of recreational drug use."
"6677","1","Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^
Mephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users."
"8843","1","Psilocybin-Mediated Attenuation of Gamma Band Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSR) Is Driven by the Intensity of Cognitive and Emotional Domains of Psychedelic Experience.^
Psilocybin is a classical serotoninergic psychedelic that induces cognitive disruptions similar to psychosis. Gamma activity is affected in psychosis and is tightly related to cognitive processing. The 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) are frequently used as indicators to test the ability to generate gamma activity. Based on previous literature, we studied the impact of psilocybin on 40 Hz ASSR in healthy volunteers. The study was double blind and placebo controlled with a crossover design. A sample of 20 healthy subjects (10M/10F) received psilocybin orally 0.26 mg/kg or placebo. Participants were measured four times in total, one time before ingestion of psilocybin/placebo and one time after ingestion, during the peak of intoxication. A series of 500 ms click trains were used for stimulation. Psilocybin induced a psychedelic effect and decreased 40 Hz ASSR phase-locking index compared to placebo. The extent of the attenuation was related to Cognition and Affect on the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. The current study shows that psilocybin lowers the synchronization level and the amplitude of 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses, which yields further support for the role of gamma oscillations in cognitive processing and its disturbance."
"5944","1","Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.^
The glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
"4880","0","Enhancing recovery in early schizophrenia - A controlled clinical trial investigating cannabidiol CR vs. placebo as an add-on to antipsychotic treatment.^
Current antipsychotic treatments of schizophrenia are only partially effective, and their use is often associated with serious side effects. Cannabidiol is a natural counterpart of the psychoactive component of marijuana, delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol and has no psychotomimetic or addictive properties. In a controlled clinical trial of cannabidiol versus amisulpride in acute paranoid schizophrenia we showed a statistically significant clinical improvement in all symptoms clusters of schizophrenia compared to baseline with either treatment. Cannabidiol displayed a significantly superior side‐effect profile in particular regarding prolactin elevation, extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain. The favorable side‐effect profile and potentially novel mechanism of action identify this molecule as a potential antipsychotic. However, long‐term safety and efficacy data is still lacking. This study in 180 remitted schizophrenia patients is to evaluate the effi‐ cacy and safety of the novel compound cannabidiol in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in comparison to placebo as an add‐on to an established treatment with either olanzapine or amisulpride, in a 12 months, double‐blind, parallel‐group, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Thereby, relevant data on cannabidiol's antipsychotic potential will be gained."
"916","0","Therapeutic Applications of Classic Hallucinogens.^
This chapter reviews what is known about the therapeutic uses of the serotonergic or classic hallucinogens, i.e., psychoactive drugs such as LSD and psilocybin that exert their effects primarily through agonist activity at serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. Following a review of the history of human use and scientific study of these drugs, the data from clinical research are summarized, including extensive work on the use of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of alcoholism and other addictions, studies of the use of LSD and psilocybin to relieve distress concerning death, particularly in patients with advanced or terminal cancer, and more limited data concerning the use of classic hallucinogens to treat mood and anxiety disorders. A survey of possible mechanisms of clinically relevant effects is provided. The well-established safety of classic hallucinogens is reviewed. To provide a clinical perspective, case summaries are provided of two individuals who received treatment in recent controlled trials of psilocybin: one being treated for alcoholism, the other suffering from anxiety and depression related to fear of death due to a cancer diagnosis. Although promising early phase research conducted from the 1950s through the early 1970s was discontinued before firm conclusions could be reached concerning the efficacy of any of the classic hallucinogens for any clinical condition, the research that was conducted in that era strongly suggests that classic hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects, particularly in the case of LSD treatment of alcoholism. In the past decade, clinical trials have resumed investigating the effects of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of existential distress in the face of cancer, and in the treatment of addictions including alcoholism and nicotine addiction. The studies that have been completed to date are not sufficient to establish efficacy, but the outcomes have been very encouraging, and larger trials, up to and including phase 3, are now underway or being planned. Although research has elucidated many of the acute neurobiological and psychological effects of classic hallucinogens on humans, animals, and in vitro systems, the mechanisms of clinically relevant persisting effects remain poorly understood."
"7763","0","Preliminary study of the interactive effects of THC and ethanol on self-reported ability and simulated driving, subjective effects, and cardiovascular responses.^
RATIONALE: Drug- and alcohol-related motor vehicle accidents are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Compared to alcohol, less is known about the effects of cannabis on driving and even less about their combined effects. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the combined and separate effects of ethanol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on perceived ability to drive, subjective effects, and simulated driving. METHODS: In a within-subject (crossover), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2 × 2 design, the effects of oral THC (10 mg [dronabinol] or placebo) and low-dose intravenous ethanol (clamped at BAC 0.04% or placebo) on perceived ability to drive, simulated driving (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP]), subjective effects (e.g., ""high""), and physiological effects (e.g., heart rate) were studied in healthy humans (n = 18). RESULTS: Subjects reported reductions in perceived ability to drive (THC < ethanol < combination) which persisted for ~ 6 h (placebo = ethanol, THC < combination). Ethanol and THC produced synergistic effects on heart rate, significant differences compared to either drug alone on perceived ability to drive and feeling states of intoxication (e.g., high), as well increases in SDLP compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived ability to drive is reduced under the influence of THC against the backdrop of blood alcohol levels that are below the legal limit. People should be aware that the effects of oral THC on driving may persist for up to six hours from administration. Findings are relevant to the increasingly common practice of combining alcohol and cannabinoids and the effects on driving."
"4783","1","Arketamine as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression: A placebo-controlled pilot study.^
Background: Racemic ketamine is a mixture of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine), with the latter regarded as the main isomer for antidepressant effects. However, preclinical data and one open-label human trial suggest arketamine might exert a more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effect with fewer side effects. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of arketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to assess its efficacy and safety compared to placebo. Methods: This is a, randomized, double-blind, crossover, pilot trial (n = 10). All participants received saline and arketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a one-week interval. Treatment effects were analyzed with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. Results: Our analysis suggested the presence of a carryover effect, so the main efficacy analysis was limited to the first week, which demonstrated a main effect of time (p = 0.038) but not for treatment (p = 0.40) or their interaction (p = 0.95). This indicates that depression improved over time, but without significant difference between arketamine and placebo. Analyzing the two weeks together, findings were the same. Dissociation and other adverse events were minimal. Limitations: This was a pilot study with a small sample and underpowered. Conclusions: Arketamine was not superior to placebo for TRD but demonstrated to be extremely safe. Our findings reinforce the importance of continuing studies with this drug, with better powered clinical trials, perhaps considering a parallel design with higher or flexible doses and repeated administrations.

"1620","0","Nitrous oxide for TRD: preliminary findings.^
Background: Recently, NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., ketamine) have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) patients. Because nitrous oxide, an inhalational general anesthetic, is also an NMDA receptor antagonist, we hypothesized that nitrous oxide may be a rapidly acting treatment for TRD. Methods: Twenty TRD patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo‐controlled crossover trial; each received a 1‐hour inhalation of up to 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen or 50% nitrogen/50% oxygen (placebo control) in random order. Primary endpoint was change on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS‐21) 24 hours post‐treatment. Results: Mean duration of nitrous oxide treatment was 55.6 ± 2.5 (SD) minutes. In two patients nitrous oxide treatment was interrupted (subsequently resumed) and in three discontinued. Depressive symptoms improved significantly at 2 hours and 24 hours after receiving nitrous oxide compared to placebo (mean change HDRS‐21 score at 2 hours: ‐4.8 points, 95% CI ‐1.8 to ‐ 7.8 points, p= 0.002; at 24 hours: ‐5.5 points, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐8.5 points, p<0.001; comparison between nitrous oxide and placebo: p<0.001). Four patients (20%) had treatment response (≥50% HDRS reduction) and three patients (15%) remitted (HRDS ≤ 7 points) after nitrous oxide compared to one patient (5%) and none after placebo (odds ratio [OR] for response 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 ‐ 35.79; OR for remission 3.0, 95% CI 0.31 ‐ 28.8). All adverse events were brief and mild to moderate severity. Conclusions: This proof‐of‐concept trial demonstrated that nitrous oxide has rapid and marked antidepressant effects in patients with treatment‐resistant depression."

This randomized‐controlled pilot study uses a wait‐list control design. A wait‐list design includes a control group that is assigned to a waiting list to receive an intervention after the active treatment group does. In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait‐list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34. The wait‐list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait‐list participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date. This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and follow‐up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a total of 12 completer participants as well as 2‐3 family members or friends per study participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM‐R). This number will account for screen‐failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6‐month delayed participation group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects of the psilocybin intervention. Twelve volunteers (6 from each group) will participate at Johns Hopkins and 12 at New York University. Randomization and data analysis will be conducted at New York University."
"3398","1","A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, but the time profile of ketamine's anxiolytic effect is ill-defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the anxiolytic effect of ketamine at different time points across a range of clinical settings. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to capture randomised control trials measuring the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in contexts including mood disorders, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. The correlations between (1) improvements in mean anxiety and depression scores, and (2) peak dissociation and improvements in mean anxiety scores were also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 11 studies. Ketamine significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to placebo at acute (<12 h; standard mean difference (SMD): -1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.89, -0.44], p < 0.01), subacute (24 h; SMD: -0.44, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.22], p < 0.01) and sustained (7-14 days; SMD: -0.40, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.17], p < 0.01) time points. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms correlated at both subacute (R(2) = 0.621, p = 0.035) and sustained time points (R(2) = 0.773, p = 0.021). The relationship between peak dissociation and improvement in anxiety was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine appears to offer rapid and sustained anxiety symptom relief across a range of clinical settings, with anxiolytic effects occurring within the first 12 h of administration and remaining effective for 1-2 weeks. Future studies could explore the effects of ketamine maintenance therapy on anxiety symptoms."

This study examined the overall psychological effects of inebriation facilitated by the naturally-occurring plant hallucinogen Salvia divinorum using a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial. Thirty healthy individuals self-administered Salvia divinorum via combustion and inhalation in a quiet, comfortable research setting. Experimental sessions, post-session interviews, and 8-week follow-up meetings were audio recorded and transcribed to provide the primary qualitative material analyzed here. Additionally, post-session responses to the Hallucinogen Rating Scale provided a quantitative groundwork for mixed-methods discussion. Qualitative data underwent thematic content analysis, being coded independently by three researchers before being collaboratively integrated to provide the final results. Three main themes and 10 subthemes of acute intoxication emerged, encompassing the qualities of the experience, perceptual alterations, and cognitive-affective shifts. The experience was described as having rapid onset and being intense and unique. Participants reported marked changes in auditory, visual, and interoceptive sensory input; losing normal awareness of themselves and their surroundings; and an assortment of delusional phenomena. Additionally, the abuse potential of Salvia divinorum was examined post hoc. These findings are discussed in light of previous research, and provide an initial framework for greater understanding of the subjective effects of Salvia divinorum, an emerging drug of abuse."
"8877","1","Effects of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Conditioned Fear Extinction and Retention in a Crossover Study in Healthy Subjects.^
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown initial promise as an adjunct in psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated across phase I-III studies. However, the mechanism underlying the potential utility of MDMA to treat PTSD in humans has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Preliminary evidence suggests that MDMA may facilitate fear extinction recall, which may be through the release of oxytocin. To test this hypothesis, we examined the efficacy of acute MDMA treatment to enhance fear extinction learning and recall. Methods: We used a two-period, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design in 30 healthy male subjects who received a placebo and a single dose of MDMA (125 mg). Fear extinction was tested using two separate Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms, one using skin conductance response (SCR), and the other fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to conditioned cues. MDMA treatment occurred after fear conditioning and 2 h before extinction learning. Extinction recall was tested 23 h after MDMA intake. Additional outcome measures included subjective effects, emotion recognition tasks, plasma levels of oxytocin, and pharmacokinetics. Results: Fear conditioning and extinction learning were successful in both fear extinction paradigms (generalized eta-squared [ges] for SCR: 0.08; FPS: 0.07). Compared to placebo treatment, MDMA treatment significantly reduced SCRs to the reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+) during extinction learning (ges = 0.03) and recall (ges = 0.06). Intensity of the subjective effects of MDMA (good effect, trust, and openness) during extinction learning negatively correlated with the discrimination between CS+ and the safety stimulus (CS-) during recall. MDMA did not influence FPS to conditioned cues. Oxytocin concentration was increased fourfold on average by MDMA during acute effects but was not associated with fear extinction outcomes. Conclusions: MDMA treatment facilitated rapid fear extinction and retention of extinction as measured by SCR to fear cues, in line with animal studies of MDMA facilitation of extinction. However, this effect may be limited to certain forms of learned fear responses, as it was not observed in the extinction model using startle reactivity as the outcome. This study provides further evidence for the facilitation of extinction with MDMA treatment and suggests this may be a component of its efficacy when paired with psychotherapy.

"131","1","Drug assisted psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder in war veterans, using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as MDMA).^
INTERVENTION: This is a two arm, randomised, multi‐dose study with an additional open label lead‐in for two participants. The open label lead‐in will involve two participants receiving two experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions of approximately eight hours duration each, using the full dose of 125mg 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with an optional supplemental dose 2.5 hours later of 62.5mg MDMA (cumulative dose 187.5mg, administered as capsules). At the commencement of each experimental session the participant will undergo a urine drug screen and pregnancy test, a psychological assessment and then begin acclimatising to the environment. The MDMA will be administered soon afterwards, approximately 30‐60 minutes after the session begins. The two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions will be 3‐5 weeks apart and form part of a 12 session treatment over six months, which includes 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions of 90 minutes duration for preparatory, integrative and follow‐up purposes. The session sequence will be as follows. Sessions 1,2,3: Non‐drug preparatory psychotherapy. Session 4: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 5,6,7: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 8: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 9,10,11: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 12: Non‐drug follow‐up psychotherapy. The aim of the open label lead‐in is to verify therapist adherence to the psychotherapy manual prior to proceeding with Stage 1. Stage 1 is double‐blinded and will compare 125mg MDMA versus 30mg MDMA active placebo in the remaining 12 participants. The 30mg MDMA active placebo is not expected to provide therapeutic benefits and is aimed at ensuring an effective blind by producing some physiological effects. Those randomised to receive the full dose in Stage 1 will receive two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions and 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions of exactly the same duration and sequence as those in the lead‐in. Those randomised to receive the active placebo in Stage 1 will receive two drug‐assisted (active placebo) psychotherapy sessions using 30mg MDMA with an optional supplemental dose of 15mg MDMA (cumulative dose 45mg) and 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions. The session duration and the sequence of the 12 sessions will be exactly the same as those in the lead‐in. Stage 2 is an optional treatment for those participants (only) who received the active placebo in Stage 1. After unblinding at the end of Stage 1, eligible participants who choose to complete Stage 2 will undergo an open label full dose treatment involving two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions and eight non‐drug psychotherapy sessions. The session durations will be the same as for the lead‐in. The session sequence for Stage 2 is as follows. Session 1: Non‐drug preparatory psychotherapy. Session 2: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 3,4,5: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 6: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 7,8,9: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 10: Non‐drug follow‐up psychotherapy. All study participants will attend an additional long term follow‐up session 12 months after their final experimental drug‐assisted session.

The detection of changes in mental states such as those caused by psychoactive drugs relies on clinical assessments that are inherently subjective. Automated speech analysis may represent a novel method to detect objective markers, which could help improve the characterization of these mental states. In this study, we employed computer-extracted speech features from multiple domains (acoustic, semantic, and psycholinguistic) to assess mental states after controlled administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and intranasal oxytocin. The training/validation set comprised within-participants data from 31 healthy adults who, over four sessions, were administered MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), oxytocin (20 IU), and placebo in randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants completed two 5-min speech tasks during peak drug effects. Analyses included group-level comparisons of drug conditions and estimation of classification at the individual level within this dataset and on two independent datasets. Promising classification results were obtained to detect drug conditions, achieving cross-validated accuracies of up to 87% in training/validation and 92% in the independent datasets, suggesting that the detected patterns of speech variability are associated with drug consumption. Specifically, we found that oxytocin seems to be mostly driven by changes in emotion and prosody, which are mainly captured by acoustic features. In contrast, mental states driven by MDMA consumption appear to manifest in multiple domains of speech. Furthermore, we find that the experimental task has an effect on the speech response within these mental states, which can be attributed to presence or absence of an interaction with another individual. These results represent a proof-of-concept application of the potential of speech to provide an objective measurement of mental states elicited during intoxication."
"6428","1","MDMA-related presentations to the emergency departments of the European Drug Emergencies Network plus (Euro-DEN Plus) over the four-year period 2014-2017.^
CONTEXT: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) remains one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in Europe. Monitoring of Emergency Department (ED) presentations with acute toxicity associated with MDMA is important to determine trends in MDMA use and harms. METHODS: Data were extracted from the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) Plus database for all ED presentations with acute toxicity involving MDMA use, alone or in combination with other substances, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Geographical distribution, time trends, patient demographics, clinical features, management and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Out of 23,947 presentations, 2013 (8.4%) involved MDMA, used alone (88, 4.4%) or with other substances (1925, 95.6%). The proportion of MDMA presentations varied by country, from over 15% in France to less than 5% in Norway. For the 15 sentinel centres where data were available for all four years, MDMA-related presentations peaked in 2016 (10.4% versus 8.1% in 2015, p < 0.0001), thereafter decreasing in 2017 (8.2%, p = 0.0002). 1436 (71.3%) presentations involved males. Females were significantly younger than males (median 23 years, interquartile range, IQR, 20-27 years, versus median 25 years, IQR 21-30 years, p < 0.0001). Compared to presentations of acute toxicity with lone-use cocaine, presentations with lone-use MDMA occurred more frequently during the weekend (58.0% versus 43.9%, p = 0.02), were more frequently medically discharged directly from the ED (74.7% versus 62.4%, p = 0.03), and less frequently received sedation (43.5% versus 66.5%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This large multicentre series of MDMA presentations to EDs showed geographical variation and changes in time trends and in patient demographics. Triangulation with data from complementary sources including seizures, prevalence of use and wastewater analysis, will enable a greater understanding of the public health implications of MDMA use in Europe."
"1362","1","Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy-A Systematic Review of Associated Psychological Interventions.^
Modern clinical research on psychedelics is generating interesting outcomes in a wide array of clinical conditions when psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is delivered to appropriately screened participants and in controlled settings. Still, a number of patients relapse or are less responsive to such treatments. Individual and contextual factors (i.e., set and setting) seem to play a role in shaping the psychedelic experience and in determining clinical outcomes. These findings, coupled with data from literature on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, frame the therapeutic context as a potential moderator of clinical efficacy, highlighting the need to investigate how to functionally employ environmental and relational factors. In this review, we performed a structured search through two databases (i.e., PubMed/Medline and Scopus) to identify records of clinical studies on psychedelics which used and described a structured associated psychotherapeutic intervention. The aim is to construct a picture of what models of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy are currently adopted in clinical research and to report on their clinical outcomes. Ad-hoc and adapted therapeutic methods were identified. Common principles, points of divergence and future directions are highlighted and discussed with special attention toward therapeutic stance, degree of directiveness and the potential suggestive effects of information provided to patients."
"6024","0","Combined Ketamine/Propofol for Emergency Department Procedural Sedation.^
Introduction Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are used for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in Emergency Departments, including propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, and others, but propofol has gained popularity despite its potential to cause cardiac and respiratory depression. Obviously the optimal agent or combination of agents has not been identified. There are reasons to believe that a combination of ketamine and propofol may have advantages over other agents/combinations. These include better hemodynamic stability at equal depth of anesthesia with a combination of ketamine/propofol than with propofol alone, less respiratory depression with the combination in comparison to propofol alone, and preservation of respiratory drive with the combination. There is one study of ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or combinations. We designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare propofol to propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in Emergency Department procedural sedation and analgesia. Our hypothesis was that the combination of propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory depression than propofol alone. Methods Study design We conducted a randomized, prospective, double‐blinded study of all patients receiving procedural sedation. From May 2007 until March 2009 in the ED of a 274 bed university teaching hospital. The study was approved by the University of Missouri's Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Study setting and population All patients requiring PSA in the ED were viewed as potential subjects unless they were pregnant, less than 1 year of age, history of prior adverse reaction to anesthesia, underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic dysfunction, porphyria, psychiatric illness, allergy to eggs/soybeans, increased intracranial or intraocular pressure, abnormal airway pathology or an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or greater. The attending ED physician would then approach the patient to enroll them in the study. If the patient accepted they were randomized by the hospital pharmacy. Study protocol An ED attending physician was dedicated to PSA throughout the procedure. Patients had EKG, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end‐tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) monitored, had IV access obtained and were placed on nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. All patients received pre‐procedure analgesia with 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/Kg of fentanyl and all patients had reflective sunglasses placed so as to obscure eye movements from the staff. Subjects were randomized by the pharmacy in blocks of ten. Consecutively numbered pre‐filled 3cc syringes were prepared by the pharmacy staff once they received a signed and dated study enrollment sheet from the ER staff with the patients weight in kilograms provided. All physicians, nurses, patients and study personnel were blinded to the contents of the syringes which were hand delivered by pharmacy personnel. The quantity of all drugs delivered were recorded. During the procedure all patients were monitored for 5 respiratory depression markers: ‐ PetCO2 rise of ³ 5 mm/Hg ‐ Respiratory rate < 8 br/min ‐ arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) < 90% ‐ Apnea ³ 15 seconds ‐ Airway manipulation Physicians were permitted to intervene and provide any supportive/resuscitative measures at there discretion despite the pre‐specified respiratory depression markers. 1. Not satisfied 2. Somewhat satisfied 3. Satisfied Patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/Kg of ketamine or placebo (normal saline) delivered to the emergency room sedating physician in a 3 cc syringe containing a clear/colorless solution. This solution was delivered intravenously over a one minute infusion. On completion of this infusion all patients received propofol start ng at 1 mg/Kg over 2 minutes and supplemented with repeated boluses of 0.5 mg/Kg to maintain adequate sedation. Patients were felt to be adequately sedated once they received a Colorado Behavioral Numerical Pain Scale (CBNPS) score of 0 to 113(table 1.) Patients were monitored after the procedure until a normal level of consciousness was observed. All data were collected and recorded on standardized Hospital PSA forms. Data was collected for the entire time frame of the individual procedural sedations. Following the completion of the procedural sedation a second form was filled out by both the sedating physician and monitoring nurse recording specifically any respiratory events/rescue interventions and overall satisfaction with the procedural sedation. The overall quality of the PSA was evaluated by the physician/nurse performing the sedation as one of the following: 4. Very satisfied 5. Excellent All data was recorded on a secure computer in spreadsheet form (Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for later analysis. Outcome Measures Four endpoints were defined prior to study initiation: Respiratory Depression. A difference in evidence of respiratory depression between the groups. Respiratory depression was defined as the occurrence of any of the 5 markers. Satisfaction with PSA. A difference in the evaluation of the quality of the sedation by the providers. Quality of PSA. Number of patients with a CBNPS of 0. Propofol usage. Did the addition of ketamine significantly reduce the amount of propofol needed to produce adequate PSA. Data analysis We plan to enroll 100 patients in each group. This is based on an estimate of a 40% incidence of respiratory depression with propofol alone, a reduction to 20% with the combination of ketamine/propofol, an a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.14‐16. An interim analysis was conducted at enrollment of 100 patients using a significance of 0.025 for difference in respiratory depression. Respiratory depression and CBNPS were compared using a chi‐squared test and Satisfaction with PSA and Quality of PSA were compared using a t‐test. Tests were done with Primer of Biostatistics (Version 6.0, Stanton A. Glantz, 2005)."

The objective of this study was to investigate abuse conditions of new-type drugs for users who are seeking treatment, gender differences, and differences between the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) users and mixed amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine (ATS. +. K) poly-drug users. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with a final diagnosis of the substance use disorder according to the Diagnoses and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) who underwent treatment for exposure to new-type drugs at the mental health center of the West China Hospital from March 2009 to May 2011. A questionnaire was used to collect information about socio-demographics, drug abuse conditions and psychiatric co-morbidities. Male subjects were older (p=0.026), had low level education (p=0.003), were less previously married (p<0.001), were more likely to be employed and to hold higher status jobs (p=0.007); 77.1% of subjects had a psychotic disorder, 28.0% of subjects had a mood disorder, 39.7% had an anxiety disorder, and 45.0% had a cognitive impairment disorder. More men used methamphetamine MA (p<0.001), tobacco (p=0.014) and more than one drug substance (p=0.004) compared to women; women were more vulnerable to mood disorders (p=0.034) than men. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA (p<0.001) and develop more psychotic disorders (p=0.04) than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (p=0.002), alcohol (p=0.014) and develop more cognitive impairment disorder (p=0.034). The present study found that the new-type drug patients have a high degree of psychiatric morbidities; more men were using MA, tobacco and multi-substance and more women patients experience mood disorder in the gender differences. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and develop more psychotic disorders than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA, alcohol and develop more cognitive impairment disorder. These results suggested that the psychiatrists should focus on the mood disorder among females, psychotic disorders among males who abuse ATS and ketamine, and cognitive impairment disorder for the females who abuse ATS and ketamine. © 2012."
"809","1","Long-Term Efficacy of Combination Therapy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Ketamine for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). METHODS: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2‐4.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10‐30 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up. RESULTS: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test (a=0.01, t=22.81, p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."
"5513","1","The effectiveness of repeated intravenous ketamine on depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and functional disability in adults with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^
BACKGROUND: The effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) receiving care in real-word settings is insufficiently characterized. Herein, results from a naturalistic, retrospective study are presented from a Canadian outpatient IV ketamine clinic. METHODS: Adults (N = 213; M(age) = 45) with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, with a minimum of Stage 2 antidepressant resistance, received IV ketamine at a community-based multi-disciplinary clinic. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to post-infusion 4 on the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16); n = 190). Secondary measures included QIDS-SR(16)-measured response and remission rates, changes from baseline to endpoint in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7; n = 188) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; n = 168). RESULTS: Significant improvement in total depressive symptoms severity (p < 0.0001) was observed after four infusions of IV ketamine 0.5-0.75 mg/kg. Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score change ≥ 50%) was 27% and remission (QIDS-SR(16) total score ≤5) rate was 13%. Patients receiving IV ketamine exhibited anxiolytic effects (p < 0.0001,), improved overall psychosocial function (p < 0.0001), and reduced suicidal ideation (p < 0.0001). Compared to the baseline infusion, dissociation severity significantly reduced in subsequent infusions. LIMITATIONS: This was a naturalistic, retrospective study, without a control group. CONCLUSIONS: IV ketamine was safe, well-tolerated, and effective at improving depressive, anxiety, and functional impairment symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of adults with TRD."
"4294","1","Ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders: systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is an effective short-term treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. A key question is whether the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment improves outcomes or delays relapse. AIM: To identify all studies combining psychotherapy with ketamine for the treatment of psychiatric disorders to summarise their effects and make recommendations for future research. METHOD: The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022318120). Potential studies were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, the Cochrane library and Google Scholar. Eligible studies combined ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and did not use case reports or qualitative designs. Key findings relating to psychotherapy type, diagnosis, ketamine protocol, sequencing of psychotherapy and study design are reported. Risk of bias was assessed using modified Joanna Briggs critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Nineteen studies evaluating 1006 patients were included in the systematic review. A variety of supportive individual and group, manualised and non-manualised psychotherapies were used. The majority of studies evaluated substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine protocols and sequencing of ketamine/psychotherapy treatment varied substantially between studies. Outcomes were largely positive for the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of psychotherapy and ketamine offers promise for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but study heterogeneity prevents definitive recommendations for their integration. Larger randomised controlled trials using manualised psychotherapies and standardised ketamine protocols are recommended to clarify the extent to which the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine improves outcomes over ketamine treatment alone."
"782","1","Spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional face processing modulations induced by the serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin.^
Emotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control."
"6419","1","Psychedelic therapy for smoking cessation: Qualitative analysis of participant accounts.^
BACKGROUND: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications."
"8864","0","Antidepressants for the treatment of depression in people with cancer.^
BACKGROUND: Major depression and other depressive conditions are common in people with cancer. These conditions are not easily detectable in clinical practice, due to the overlap between medical and psychiatric symptoms, as described by diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anticancer treatment, suicide risk and possibly the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage). SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was November 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants, in adults (aged 18 years or above) with any primary diagnosis of cancer and depression (including major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder or depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal diagnosis). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. efficacy as a continuous outcome. Our secondary outcomes were 2. efficacy as a dichotomous outcome, 3. Social adjustment, 4. health-related quality of life and 5. dropouts. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 14 studies (1364 participants), 10 of which contributed to the meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Six of these compared antidepressants and placebo, three compared two antidepressants, and one three-armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update, we included four additional studies, three of which contributed data for the primary outcome. For acute-phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks), antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, even though the evidence is very uncertain. This was true when depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to -0.12; 7 studies, 511 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and when measured as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96; 5 studies, 662 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported data on follow-up response (more than 12 weeks). In head-to-head comparisons, we retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and for mirtazapine versus TCAs. There was no difference between the various classes of antidepressants (continuous outcome: SSRI versus TCA: SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.18; 3 studies, 237 participants; very low-certainty evidence; mirtazapine versus TCA: SMD -4.80, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.10; 1 study, 25 participants). There was a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants versus placebo for the secondary efficacy outcomes (continuous outcome, response at one to four weeks; very low-certainty evidence). There were no differences for these outcomes when comparing two different classes of antidepressants, even though the evidence was very uncertain. In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 9 studies, 889 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and TCAs (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.22; 3 studies, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the heterogeneous quality of the studies, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide CIs, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were few and of low quality. This review found a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants against placebo in depressed participants with cancer. However, the certainty of evidence is very low and, on the basis of these results, it is difficult to draw clear implications for practice. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head-to-head data, the choice of which drug to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of people with major depression, also taking into account that data on people with other serious medical conditions suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. Furthermore, this update shows that the usage of the newly US Food and Drug Administration-approved antidepressant esketamine in its intravenous formulation might represent a potential treatment for this specific population of people, since it can be used both as an anaesthetic and an antidepressant. However, data are too inconclusive and further studies are needed. We conclude that to better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder."
"4349","1","Decreases in State and Trait Anxiety Post-psilocybin: A Naturalistic, Observational Study Among Retreat Attendees.^
Anxiety disorders are the most common type of psychiatric disorders among Western countries. Evidence-based treatment modalities including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy result in deficient treatment responses. Historical and recent research suggests psychedelic drugs may be efficacious in alleviating anxiety-related symptoms among healthy and clinical populations. The main aim of the present study was investigation of the effects of psilocybin-containing truffles, when taken in a supportive group setting, on ratings of state and trait anxiety across self-reported healthy volunteers. Attendees of psilocybin ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: before the ceremony (baseline), the morning after, and 1 week after the ceremony. The test battery included questionnaires assessing state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), mindfulness capacities (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory). Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire and the Ego Dissolution Inventory. The total amount of psilocybin-containing truffles consumed by each participant was recorded, and a sample of the truffles was analyzed to determine psilocin concentrations. Fifty-two attendees (males = 25; females = 25; others = 2) completed parts of the baseline assessment, 46 (males = 21; females = 24; others = 1) completed assessments the morning after the ceremony, and 23 (males = 10; females = 13) completed assessments at the 1-week follow-up. Average psilocin consumption across individuals was 27.1 mg. The morning after the ceremony, we observed medium reductions in anxiety measures (both state and trait) compared to baseline ( d¯ = 6.4; p < 0.001 and d¯ = 6; p = 0.014, respectively), which persisted over a 1-week period post-ceremony ( d¯ = 6.7; p = 0.001 and d¯ = 8.6; p = 0.004, respectively). At 1 week post-ceremony, the non-judging facet of the mindfulness scale was increased ( d¯ = 1.5; p = 0.03), while the personality trait neuroticism decreased ( d¯ = 5.2; p = 0.005), when compared to baseline. Additionally, we found ratings of ego dissolution (mean: 59.7, SD: 28.3) and changes in neuroticism to be the strongest predictors of reductions in state and trait anxiety, respectively. In sum, results suggest rapid and persisting (up to 1 week) anxiolytic effects in individuals with sub-clinical anxiety symptoms, which are related to the acute experience of ego dissolution, as well as lasting changes in trait neuroticism. Results also add support to the feasibility and potential efficacy of group sessions with psychedelics. To understand whether these effects extend to wider populations suffering from heightened anxiety, and the mechanisms involved, further experimental research is needed."

The objective of this study was to determine the clinical effects of party pills containing benzylpiperazine (BZP) and trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP) when taken alone and in combination with alcohol. The study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a hospital-based clinic in Wellington, New Zealand. Thirty-five volunteers who had previously used party pills containing BZP were included in this trial. Participants received one of the following four treatments: 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and placebo, 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol, placebo and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol and double placebo. The primary outcome variable was a measure of driving performance, the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) measured at 6.5 h. Secondary measures included adverse events, cardiovascular effects, psychological function and delayed effects on sleep. The study was stopped early, after 35 of the planned 64 subjects had undertaken testing, because of severe adverse events that occurred in four of 10 BZP/TFMPP-only subjects, three of seven combined BZP/TFMPP and alcohol subjects, none of the 6 placebo subjects, and none of the 12 alcohol-only subjects. The overall rate of severe adverse events (defined as causing considerable interference with usual activity and/or rated by subject as severe) in those receiving BZP/TFMPP was seven of 17 (41.2%, 95% CI 18.4-67.1). The severe events included agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, vomiting, insomnia and migraine. BZP/TFMPP significantly improved the driving performance, decreasing SDLP at -4.2 cm (95% CI-6.8 to -1.6, P = 0.002). The effect of alcohol was to increase SDLP: 2.3 cm (95% CI-0.3 to 4.9, P = 0.08). BZP/TFMPP also resulted in increased heart rate and blood pressure and in difficulty in getting to sleep. BZP/TFMPP alone or with alcohol carries a significant risk of severe adverse events when taken in similar doses to those recommended by manufacturers."
"4009","0","The Role of Ketamine in the Treatment of Bipolar Depression: A Scoping Review.^
Bipolar depression remains a clinical challenge with a quarter of patients failing to respond to initial conventional treatments. Although ketamine has been extensively studied in unipolar depression, its role in bipolar disorder remains inconclusive. The aim of our scoping review was to comprehensively synthesize the current clinical literature around ketamine use in bipolar depression. A total of 10 clinical studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 5 open label studies) were selected. The preliminary evidence, albeit weak, suggests that ketamine is a promising treatment and calls for further interest from the research community. Overall, ketamine treatment appeared to be tolerable with minimal risk for manic/hypomanic switching and showed some effectiveness across parameters of depression and suicidality. Moreover, ketamine is a potential treatment agent in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression with promising data extracted from extant controlled trials and real-world effectiveness studies. Future studies are needed to identify ketamine's role in acute and maintenance treatment phases of bipolar depression. Moreover, future researchers should study the recurrence prevention and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine in the treatment of bipolar depression."

All participants will receive 5 sessions of MET, starting at 24hrs post‐dosing. Heavy drinking will be assessed as percent heavy drinking days using the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) at baseline and 1‐, 4‐, and 12‐weeks post‐dosing. A total of 128 male and female patients between the ages of 22‐65 with a moderate to severe AUD diagnosis will be recruited from the community. Participants will undergo a thorough screening procedure and eligible participants will be randomly allocated to the high (N=64) or low (N=64) psilocybin doses. All participants will complete a baseline session consisting of clinical, behavioral, and neuroimaging measures. Following the single dosing session, participants will complete 5 weekly MET sessions. Neuroimaging measures will be assessed again at 1‐week post‐doing. Clinical and behavioral outcomes will be measured at 1‐, 4‐, and 12‐weeks post‐dosing"
"8513","0","Recent developments pertaining to treatment‐resistant depression: A 40‐year perspective.^
Comments on an article by R. S. McIntyre et al. (see record [rid]2024-11189-009[/rid]). The concept of TRD is nearly as old as the first generation of effective treatments for depression, namely electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The first papers using that concept were published in the 1970s. In that era, an almost intuitive hierarchy emerged on the basis of the clinical effort needed to implement the treatment: TCAs were generally used first, MAOIs second and ECT third for most patients. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRD in that era, though clinical wisdom taught that MAOIs worked in about one half of the cases in which TCAs failed, and ECT was expected to benefit at least 80% of antidepressant non-responders. As a result, clinicians might have predicted that 70-90% of depressed patients could be treated effectively with this three-step proto- algorithm. While it remains to be seen whether intravenous ketamine or intranasal esketamine –the first FDA-approved therapy to result from these observations –will continue to be widely used a decade from now, it is a fact that the paradigm for drug discovery for TRD has changed for the foreseeable future. In this respect, the path for studying the therapeutic potential of neurosteroid drugs such as zuranolone, which is thought to in- directly affect glutamatergic neurotransmission through GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulation, has been much less arduous than previously possible. Likewise, the paradigm change determined by the proven efficacy of intravenous ketamine, a con- trolled substance with abuse liability and characteristic dissociative effects, has prepared the field for a new wave of studies examining the therapeutic benefit of psilocybin and related psychedelic compounds that were once considered essentially off limits for therapeutic research. Finally, descendants of transcranial magnetic stimulation, including intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and an accelerated high-dose iTBS protocol utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to guide or target functional connectivity, have given hope for the possibility of viable alternate neuromodulation strategies for patients with more advanced levels of TRD. McIntyre et al’s outline of the evidence concerning TRD, therefore, is timely and provides a thought-provoking overview of an exciting new era in the therapeutics of depression.

"1166","1","Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults.^
BACKGROUND: Considering the ample evidence of involvement of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of depression, pre-clinical and clinical studies have been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate inhibition, and glutamate receptor modulators in particular. This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.All included studies administered ketamine intravenously, which can pose practical problems in clinical practice. Very few trials were included in the meta-analyses for each comparison; the majority of comparisons contained only one study. Further RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine with longer follow-up, which test the comparative efficacy of ketamine and the efficacy of repeated administrations."
"4985","0","Changes in Stimulant Drug Use Over Time in the MACS: Evidence for Resilience Against Stimulant Drug Use Among Men Who Have Sex with Men.^
Stimulant drug use is associated with numerous health problems among men who have sex with men (MSM). This paper describes how stimulant drug use changes over a four and one-half year period from 2003 until 2008. Participants were 2,389 men (17,222 person-visits) from The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)-an ongoing, prospective study of HIV infection among MSM. Group-based trajectory analyses of data from these men over the study period yielded a four groups solution: consistent users (9.8%), men whose use increased (5.4%), men whose use declined (6.9%), and abstinent or rarely-using men (77.9%). There were significant differences between groups in terms of demographic, behavioral risk and HIV serostatus. Men who increased or decreased stimulant drug use over time reported congruent changes in sexual risk taking. The fact that sexual risk levels parallel stimulant drug use over time suggests that finding ways to lower rates of stimulant drug use among MSM could be a tool in HIV prevention."
"3416","0","Rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine, its metabolites and other candidates: A historical overview and future perspective.^
Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Approximately one-third of the patients with MDD are treatment resistant to the current antidepressants. There is also a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. Furthermore, depression in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) is typically poorly responsive to antidepressants. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for rapidly acting antidepressants with beneficial effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Because (S)-ketamine has higher affinity for NMDAR than (R)-ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. On 5 March 2019, esketamine nasal spray was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, preclinical data suggest that (R)-ketamine exerts greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression and that (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side-effects than (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine. In this article, the author reviews the historical overview of the antidepressant actions of enantiomers of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine and hydroxynorketamine. Furthermore, the author discusses the other potential rapid-acting antidepressant candidates (i.e., NMDAR antagonists and modulators, low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channel inhibitor, potassium channel Kir4.1 inhibitor, negative modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid, and type A [GABA(A)] receptors) to compare them with ketamine. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine's antidepressant effects are discussed."
"5385","0","Five-year monitoring of 19 illicit and legal substances of abuse at the inlet of a wastewater treatment plant in Barcelona (NE Spain) and estimation of drug consumption patterns and trends.^
Illicit and legal drugs of abuse, including alcohol, continue to be in the focus of many governmental national and international studies due to the important consequences of their consumption at both individual and social level. Estimation of drug use at the community level from the concentrations of the drugs themselves or their major metabolites measured in wastewater has become an increasingly accepted and extended tool, complementary to the methods traditionally used for this purpose. The present work describes the application of this approach, generally known as wastewater epidemiology, to investigate the latest drug consumption patterns and trends in the European city of Barcelona. To this end, a total of 19 selected drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored at the inlet of one of the main wastewater treatment plants of Barcelona every day during one week in March between 2011 and 2015. Analysis of the selected drugs and metabolites in the wastewater samples was performed by means of two methodologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the concentrations obtained were translated into consumption data. In agreement with official records, alcohol, followed by cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds, and methadone were the most consumed drugs. Alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine consumption were on average 18 mL(14 g)/day/inhabitant (> 15), 38 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, and 2.4 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, respectively. As for drug use trends, consumption increased over the 5 years monitored for all drugs, but for heroin and diazepam. Weekly profiles characterized by higher consumption over the weekend as compared to weekdays were observed only for alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA. Extrapolation of the data obtained for the area under study to the national Spanish territory yields consumption figures of 142 t of illicit drugs per year and > 2500 million euro turnover per year in the black market."
"690","1","Effects of GRIN2B , GRIA1 , and BDNF Polymorphisms on the Therapeutic Action of Ketamine and Esketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression Patients: Secondary Analysis From a Randomized Clinical Trial.^
OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic variants in glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl- d -aspartate type subunit 2B ( GRIN2B ), glutamate ionotropic receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid type subunit 1 ( GRIA1 ), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) genes on therapeutic response, remission, and total Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores after treatment with ketamine or esketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients. METHODS: Participants (N = 60) are from a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial comparing single-dose intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) to esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) for TRD. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale was applied at baseline, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days postinfusion to assess depressive symptoms. Blood samples were collected to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1805502 ( GRIN2B ), rs1994862 ( GRIA1 ), and rs6265 ( BDNF ). RESULTS: There was no association between rs1805502, rs1994862, or rs6265 polymorphisms and antidepressant response ( P = 0.909, P = 0.776, and P = 0.482, respectively), remission P = 0.790, P = 0.086, and P = 0.669), or Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores at each time point ( P = 0.907, P = 0.552, and P = 0.778). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6265, rs1805502, and rs1994862) and ketamine's therapeutic action in TRD patients. Further studies with larger samples are needed to clarify the utility of these genes of interest as predictors for antidepressant treatment."
"5026","0","AZD8529, a positive allosteric modulator at the MGGLUR2 receptor, does not improve symptoms in schizophrenia: a proof of principle study.^
Introduction: Aberrant cortical connectivity and hypofunction of NMDA receptor signaling may underlie schizophrenia symptoms. Direct activation of mGluR2/3 receptors has been shown to reduce NMDA hypofunction, reverse the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists, and in some studies, to produce an antipsychotic effect in acute schizophrenia. We have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of AZD8529 ((C25H28F3N5O6S), a selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at the mGluR2 receptor, in symptomatic patients with schizophrenia. Methods: This was a double blind, double‐dummy, placebo controlled, risperidone referenced, parallel groups, proof of concept clinical trial conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki at 3 US sites. Following 7 days washout, patients were randomized to receive either AZD8529 40 mg (n = 58), risperidone 4 mg (n = 31), or placebo (n = 55). Treatment lasted for 28 days, and clinical efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale and Improvement Scales (CGI‐S/CGI‐I) as primary outcome measures. Change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) was analyzed by ANCOVA. Results: Out of 151 patients randomized, 8 were screen failed patients who were allocated a randomization number but never received study drug, 137 were considered evaluable and included in the efficacy analysis, and 144 were used for analysis of safety and tolerability. Overall, 104 patients (75.9%) completed the 4‐week treatment trial with highest completion rate seen for patients receiving placebo, and the lowest for patients receiving risperidone. The most common reason for withdrawal was lack of efficacy; the highest rate of withdrawal for this reason was in patients treated with placebo (15.1%) and the lowest rate was for patients receiving risperidone, where all patients completed the treatment trial. Baseline PANSS did not differ between groups (AZD8529‐92.9, Placebo ‐ 93.6, risperidone ‐ 91.0). After 28 days of treatment there was no significant difference between the AZD8529 and placebo groups in the PANSS total score change from baseline (D 4.3 and 2.9 respectively p = 0.491) Risperidone was significantly different from placebo (D ‐8.6 p <0.001) in PANSS total score change from baseline. Similarly CGI and secondary measures were not different between the AZD8529 and placebo groups. Of 15 patients who discontinued early due to lack of therapeutic response, 8 were on placebo and 7 were on AZD8529; none were randomized to risperidone Conclusion: In symptomatic schizophrenia patients, AZD8529 was no more efficacious than placebo treatment as measured by PANSS total scale, the CGI, and PANSS positive and negative symptoms subscales. This single dose study does not support a role for positive modulation of mGluR2 receptors as a mechanism for monotherapy to treat acute schizophrenia. These results are also inconsistent with experimental evidence to date supporting a role for mGluR2 receptor activation in antipsychotic therapy. It remains to be determined whether different treatment regimens or adjunct treatment would provide benefit."

"3216","1","Ketamine for Rapid Reduction of Suicidal Thoughts in Major Depression: A Midazolam-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial.^
OBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy to rapidly relieve suicidal ideation in depression may reduce suicide risk. Rapid reduction in suicidal thoughts after ketamine treatment has mostly been studied in patients with low levels of suicidal ideation. The authors tested the acute effect of adjunctive subanesthetic intravenous ketamine on clinically significant suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder. METHOD: In a randomized clinical trial, adults (N=80) with current major depressive disorder and a score ≥4 on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), of whom 54% (N=43) were taking antidepressant medication, were randomly assigned to receive ketamine or midazolam infusion. The primary outcome measure was SSI score 24 hours after infusion (at day 1). RESULTS: The reduction in SSI score at day 1 was 4.96 points greater for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (95% CI=2.33, 7.59; Cohen's d=0.75). The proportion of responders (defined as having a reduction ≥50% in SSI score) at day 1 was 55% for the ketamine group and 30% for the midazolam group (odds ratio=2.85, 95% CI=1.14, 7.15; number needed to treat=4.0). Improvement in the Profile of Mood States depression subscale was greater at day 1 for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (estimate=7.65, 95% CI=1.36, 13.94), and this effect mediated 33.6% of ketamine's effect on SSI score. Side effects were short-lived, and clinical improvement was maintained for up to 6 weeks with additional optimized standard pharmacotherapy in an uncontrolled follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive ketamine demonstrated a greater reduction in clinically significant suicidal ideation in depressed patients within 24 hours compared with midazolam, partially independently of antidepressant effect."
"4241","1","10.4 COMPARISON OF IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT MEASURES OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AFTER KETAMINE TREATMENT IN ADOLESCENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER.^
Objectives: MDD is a significant pediatric health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. Prior studies have shown that ketamine is an effective treatment for adults with MDD, but little research has been conducted with pediatric MDD populations. In adults, implicit association tests (IATs) have demonstrated sensitivity to mental health changes as correlated with explicit measures on psychiatric scales. Comparing explicit and implicit measures following ketamine treatment in adolescents may illuminate the breadth of treatment response. Methods: A double blind, midazolam‐controlled, crossover study was performed (n = 17) in which subjects received 1 infusion of either ketamine or midazolam, given in random order, spaced 2 weeks apart. Participants completed the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Children’s Depression Rating Scale‐Revised (CDRS‐R), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children Second Edition (MASC 2) at 1 day following treatment. A subset of participants (n = 12) took IATs at baseline and 1‐day postinfusion. Four measurements were evaluated using IATs: 1) depression; 2) suicide/death; 3) self‐harm; and 4) anxiety. D scores from the 1‐day postinfusion IATs for all 4 IAT measurements were compared with explicit rating scales and subscales. Results: Significant changes were found from both the implicit and explicit measures after ketamine infusion. Ketamine treatment reduced D scores compared to midazolam treatment for the depression IAT (p = 0.053) with an effect size of 0.65. There was also a trend toward a reduced D score for the suicide/death IAT, with an effect size of 0.50. Ketamine significantly reduced the MADRS scores (15.44 ± 10.07; 95% CI, 10.51 to 20.37) compared to midazolam (24.13 ± 12.08; 95% CI, 18.21 to 30.04), with a mean difference of –8.69 ± 15.08 (95% CI, –16.72 to –0.65; df = 15; p = 0.036). Correlation analysis between implicit measures (IATs) and explicit measures (MADRS, CDRS‐R, MASC 2, and MADRS item 10) are ongoing. Conclusions: We have demonstrated significant movement on both the implicit and explicit measures. It is critical to assess the relationship between implicit and explicit measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinking as clinical trials seek to improve upon sole reliance on subjective reports.

"285","0","Are there sex differences associated with the effects of ecstasy/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)?.^
Sex has been identified as an important factor in moderating the effects of several drugs of abuse. Given the increasing popularity of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) use, it is important for researchers and clinicians to understand the factors that may influence its pharmacological actions to improve education, harm reduction and treatment efforts. This review focuses on preclinical and clinical research that examines the role of sex as an independent variable in the effects of ecstasy/MDMA. A systematic search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE electronic databases from 1966 to April 2006 was conducted. Both preclinical and clinical studies show a sexually dimorphic pattern in the acute, subacute and possibly long-term effects of ecstasy/MDMA. Specifically, adult females are more sensitive than males to the acute and subacute physical and psychological effects of ecstasy/MDMA and long-term alterations in aspects of 5-HT functioning. Conversely, males are more sensitive to the acute physiological effects of ecstasy/MDMA. These findings are consistent with research outcomes reported for other substances such as amphetamines and cocaine. Potential reasons for these sex differences and directions for future research are discussed."
"3719","1","Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^
BACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data."

METHOD: In a proposed double-blind crossover study of 30 adults with treatment-resistant depression, the authors performed a planned interim analysis after studying 14 participants, 12 of whom completed both conditions in randomized order: placebo or 50 mg of naltrexone preceding intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Response was defined as a reduction ≥50% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score on postinfusion day 1. RESULTS: In the interim analysis, seven of 12 adults with treatment-resistant depression met the response criterion during the ketamine plus placebo condition. Reductions in 6-item and 17-item HAM-D scores among participants in the ketamine plus naltrexone condition were significantly lower than those of participants in the ketamine plus placebo condition on postinfusion days 1 and 3. Secondary analysis of all participants who completed the placebo and naltrexone conditions, regardless of the robustness of response to ketamine, showed similar results. There were no differences in ketamine-induced dissociation between conditions. Because naltrexone dramatically blocked the antidepressant but not the dissociative effects of ketamine, the trial was halted at the interim analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ketamine's acute antidepressant effect requires opioid system activation. The dissociative effects of ketamine are not mediated by the opioid system, and they do not appear sufficient without the opioid effect to produce the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression."
"869","1","Procedural and declarative memory task performance, and the memory consolidation function of sleep, in recent and abstinent ecstasy/MDMA users.^
Ecstasy/MDMA use has been associated with various memory deficits. This study assessed declarative and procedural memory in ecstasy/MDMA users. Participants were tested in two sessions, 24 h apart, so that the memory consolidation function of sleep on both types of memory could also be assessed. Groups were: drug-naive controls (n = 24); recent ecstasy/MDMA users, who had taken ecstasy/MDMA 2-3 days before the first testing session (n = 25), and abstinent users, who had not taken ecstasy/MDMA for at least 8 days before testing (n = 17). Procedural memory did not differ between groups, but greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy was associated with poorer procedural memory. Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory. These results suggest that procedural, as well as declarative, memory deficits are associated with the extent of past ecstasy use. However, ecstasy/MDMA did not affect the memory consolidation function of sleep for either the declarative or the procedural memory task. © The Author(s) 2010."
"7130","1","Experience integrating ketamine into the healthcare system: outpatient and inpatient treatment of post-partum depression, suicidal ideation and comorbid chronic pain-mood disorders.^
Background: Ketamine is increasingly being used in clinical settings in an off‐label fashion for treatment of major depression and chronic pain. Recent studies showing improvement in suicidal ideation has further increased the interest in its clinical use because when it works, it does so within hours, possibly reducing the risk of suicidal behavior. However, many issues need to be addressed before widespread clinical use can be recommended and definitive controlled trials can be designed. This includes the need for: a) a better developed conceptual framework for the mechanisms underlying Ketamine's antidepressant and nocioceptive properties; b) a clinical algorithm guiding appropriate selection of patients (e.g., first episode vs. treatment resistant depressed patients; presence of suicidal ideation; or patients with co‐occurring chronic pain); c) the identification of dosing strategies or adjunct agents that can extend the therapeutic effect; d) optimization of Ketamine administration protocols (i.e., intramuscular vs. intravenous route of administration and bolus vs. infusion, maximally effective dose, and consequences of concurrent benzodiazepines administration); e) larger placebo‐controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Ketamine in the treatment of suicidal ideation; f) knowledge regarding the psychiatric medications that patients can be taking prior to receiving the treatment; and g) identification of predictive biomarkers and/or illness subtypes more likely to benefit from Ketamine treatment. Methods: Clinical cases of Ketamine administration for depression, suicidal ideation, and pain at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio are being reviewed for this presentation. Clinical chart data and available rating scales will be summarized. When used for treatment of depression, Ketamine is largely administered as in the previously published depression trials (0.5 mg/kg) in 40‐ minute IV infusion. For the treatment of chronic pain and in few cases of depression, much higher doses of Ketamine (up to 2 mg/ kg) are administered as IV bolus along with concurrent benzodiazepines (most often midazolam). Ketamine administration is largely conducted in outpatient settings under direct physician supervision by an anesthesiologist with constant monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation). Full psychiatric evaluations were conducted before the treatment and psychiatric follow was done within 1‐3 days after Ketamine administration. For most depressed patients, mood ratings were collected using the HAMD‐17, HAMD‐7, QIDS‐SR16 and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). Assessment of pain severity was based on ratings severity from 0=No pain to 10=Extreme pain. Results: In agreement with published literature a single Ketamine infusion rapidly alleviated depressive symptomatology (response) in more than half of our patients. The treatment is well tolerated without major side effects. In some patients with comorbid pain, pain also decreased. Most patients first noticed improvement in mood the day after infusion. Although in a patient with severe MDD and residual suicidal ideation after a suicide attempt of high lethality, a sustained clinical response (including resolution of suicidality) was noted as soon as 120 minutes after the infusion began. In one case of severe post‐partum depression, a single bolus infusion of Ketamine (with concurrent use of midazolam) led to a sustained complete remission of symptoms (leading to patient discontinuing her SSRI) that was maintained for 2 months (date of last follow up). Conclusions: A growing body of clinical and research data suggest Ketamine may have clinical utility in some cases of depression and chronic pain. Clinical trials are required to identify the conditions that would maximize Ketamine acute effectiveness, possibly sustain its benefit and ensure the safety of long‐term, regular use."
"7473","1","Patterns of Ecstasy-Associated Hyponatremia in California.^
Study objective: We describe the clinical characteristics of patients with ecstasy- (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) associated hyponatremia (serum sodium level <130 mmol/L) reported to the California Poison Control System during a 5-year period and determine whether a sex difference exists among patients with ecstasy-associated hyponatremia and hyponatremia-associated adverse outcomes. Methods: We performed a retrospective review of cases involving ecstasy intoxication reported to the California Poison Control System and recorded in its computerized database from January 1, 2000, through October 9, 2005. We excluded cases that did not involve MDMA exposure or in which there were no symptoms or were minimal effects only. Confirmation of exposure to MDMA was based on history of use and, when available, urine toxicology testing results positive for MDMA or amphetamine derivatives. Hyponatremia was defined as a measured serum sodium level less than 130 mmol/L. Results: A total of 1,436 cases potentially involving ecstasy were reported to the California Poison Control System during the 5-year study period, of which 891 were excluded according to the criteria described above. Of the 545 cases that met inclusion criteria, 296 (54.3%) were women and 249 (45.7%) were men. There were 188 cases (34.5%) with a documented serum sodium level, of which 73 (38.8%) reported hyponatremia (Na <130 mmol/L). Of the 73 subjects with hyponatremia, 55 (75.3%) were women and 18 (24.7%) men; of the 115 nonhyponatremic subjects, 50 (43.5%) were women and 65 (56.5%) were men. Among patients with a documented serum sodium level, female sex was associated with increased odds of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR] 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1 to 7.6). Among women, those with hyponatremia demonstrated increased odds of coma (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 12.9), whereas among men, no increased odds of hyponatremia-associated coma were observed (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.15 to 4.0). Conclusion: Female sex was associated with increased odds of hyponatremia and increased odds of hyponatremia-associated coma among persons with ecstasy intoxication and a documented serum sodium level reported to the California Poison Control System from 2000 to 2005. Multiple potential confounders, including spectrum bias, incomplete laboratory data, and individual differences in study subject characteristics, prevent determination of causality about sex differences in the incidence of ecstasy-associated hyponatremia and its complications. © 2007 American College of Emergency Physicians."
"2509","0","Interactions between alcohol and mephedrone in humans.^
Aims: Mephedrone is a synthetic cathinone derivative included in the class of “New‐Novel Psychoactive Substances” and marketed as “bath salt”. Mephedrone is commonly consumed simultaneously with alcohol as other psychostimulants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interactions between mephedrone and ethanol in humans. Methods: Twelve healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants participated as outpatients in four experimental sessions. They received a single oral dose of mephedrone (200 mg) and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone placebo and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone (200 mg) and placebo alcohol, and both placebos. Design was double‐blind, double‐dummy, randomized, cross‐over and controlled with placebo. Study variables included: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and pupil diameter), subjective effects (visual analogue scales‐VAS, ARCI‐49 item short form, and VESSPA questionnaire). Results: The combination produced a significant increase in the cardiovascular effects of mephedrone and induced more intense feeling of euphoria and well‐being in comparison to mephedrone and alcohol. Mephedrone reduced the drunkenness and sedation produced by alcohol. Conclusions: These results are similar to those obtained with the combination of other psychostimulants as amphetamines and MDMA. Abuse liability of the combination is greater that induced by mephedrone."
"6708","0","The psychotherapeutic potential of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) : An evidence-based review.^
Aims and rationale: The purpose of this study was to review whether methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has the appropriate pharmacodynamic profile to be a therapeutic agent. Materials and methods: Empirical descriptions of MDMA's subjective effects in humans will be reviewed to evaluate the proposal that MDMA has psychotherapeutic properties. The focus will be published evidence on its functional effects in therapeutic, medical, and other situations. Results: MDMA is a powerful central nervous system (CNS) stimulant which affects several neurotransmitter systems and intensifies a range of psychobiological functions. Its acute mood effects can be very positive and life enhancing, and the affirmative cognitions engendered during MDMA therapy may well endure afterwards. However, MDMA also has a number of potential anti-therapeutic characteristics. Acutely, it can also intensify negative cognitions, and these may similarly endure over time. Psychotherapists have found that setting, intention, and expectancy are crucial for a positive outcome, but these factors cannot be guaranteed. Post-MDMA, there is a period of neurotransmitter recovery when low moods predominate, and these may exacerbate psychiatric distress. The explanations proposed for MDMA-assisted therapy are all psychodynamic, and a neurochemical model needs to be outlined. It has been suggested that enduring therapeutic gains can follow a single session, but again, this lacks a clear psychopharmacological rationale. Finally, diathesis-stress models suggest that psychiatric individuals are more prone to acute and chronic abreactions to CNS stimulants such as MDMA. Conclusions: There are a number of issues which need to be addressed before it can be argued that MDMA might be clinically useful for psychotherapy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."
"4061","0","The abuse potential of medical psilocybin according to the 8 factors of the Controlled Substances Act.^
This review assesses the abuse potential of medically-administered psilocybin, following the structure of the 8 factors of the US Controlled Substances Act (CSA). Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. Conclusions: (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved.

"3192","1","6.3 CURRENT RESEARCH ON PSILOCYBIN TREATMENT ON END-OF-LIFE ANXIETY AND MDMA TREATMENT OF SOCIAL ANXIETY IN AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER.^
Objectives: Over the past 15 years, funding and implementation of research projects exploring the range of effects and therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs have notably increased. This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters. With the psilocybin investigation, statistically significant reductions in anxiety were identified at various points over the 6‐month follow‐up period, along with a notable reduction in depression scores at the 6‐month data point. The MDMA study demonstrated a drug effect size of 1.4 for reduction of social anxiety. Conclusions: Both the psilocybin and MDMA studies demonstrated trends toward therapeutic efficacy, with amelioration of identified target symptoms. Each of these pilot investigations succeeded in obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, requisite funding, and outcome measures consistent with therapeutic outcome. Both studies support further clinical explorations of the treatment potential of these novel psychoactive compounds. AD, ASD, PPC"

Aim. To examine the prevalence and possible interconnections among the frequencies of consuming various psychoactive substances in Zagreb adolescents. Also, to assess risk factors associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Method. We applied an anonymous, multi-dimensional, self-reporting questionnaire on a representative sample of 2,404 elementary and high school students (total age range, 13-23 years) from Zagreb, Croatia. The questionnaire was designed to explore the extent to which examinees consumed various psychoactive substances, as well as to assess their attitudes and knowledge about the substances. The socio-demographic data were collected on all examinees, their hierarchy of values, family relations, adjustment to school, relationships with peers, and high-risk and delinquent behavior. We analyzed the interconnections among the frequencies of consuming various psychoactive substances, and assessed the factors possibly predictive of substance use. Results. Almost 90% of all examinees experimented with alcohol at least once, 80% with tobacco, 39% with marijuana, and 9% with Ecstasy. Thirty-six percent consumed alcohol and 11% marijuana several times a month, whereas 28% smoked tobacco daily. Although there was no statistically significant difference according to sex in experimenting with psychoactive substances, day-to-day abuse was significantly more frequent among young men than women. About 43% of our examinees believed consuming marijuana should become legally permitted, 37% were against this policy, and 21% were undecided on this issue. Our results showed a high degree of interconnection among the frequencies of consuming tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. We also found that the best predictive factors for consummation of these three substances were a history of high-risk and delinquent behavior, troubled adjustment to school, domination of hedonistic values, and poor family relations. Regression analysis and pondering for ratios of particular predictors of psychoactive substances use gave values for coefficients of multiple regression as follows: R=0.548 (R2 =0.300; p < 0.001) for tobacco, R = 0.575 (R2 = 0.330; p < 0.001) for alcohol, and R = 0.608 (R2 = 0.370; p < 0.001) for marijuana. Knowledge about the consequences of consuming psychoactive substances positively correlated with the frequency of consuming tobacco (r = 0.213, p < 0.001), alcohol (r = 0.226, p < 0.001), and marijuana (r = 0.320, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Most adolescents had personal experience with psychoactive substance abuse, mostly alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, but only a smaller proportion became regular consumers. The frequency of substance consummation implied a generalized tendency towards substance abuse among Zagreb adolescents. Our findings could serve as empirical basis for the re-evaluation of the current drug prevention programs and programs aimed at preventing other forms of risk behavior among children and adolescents."
"8434","1","Persistent nigrostriatal dopaminergic abnormalities in ex-users of MDMA (ecstasy): An 18F-dopa PET Study.^
Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a popular recreational drug with known serotonergic neurotoxicity. Its long-term effects on dopaminergic function are less certain. Studying the long-term effects of ecstasy is often confounded by concomitant polydrug use and the short duration of abstinence. We used 18F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the long-term effects of ecstasy on nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in a group of male ex-recreational users of ecstasy who had been abstinent for a mean of 3.22 years. We studied 14 ex-ecstasy users (EEs), 14 polydrug-using controls (PCs) (matched to the ex-users for other recreational drug use), and 12 drug-naive controls (DCs). Each participant underwent one 18F-dopa PET, cognitive assessments, and hair and urinary analyses to corroborate drug-use history. The putamen 18F-dopa uptake of EEs was 9% higher than that of DCs (p=0.021). The putamen uptake rate of PCs fell between the other two groups, suggesting that the hyperdopaminergic state in EEs may be due to the combined effects of ecstasy and polydrug use. There was no relationship between the amount of ecstasy used and striatal 18 F-dopa uptake. Increased putaminal 18 F-dopa uptake in EEs after an abstinence of 3 years (mean) suggests that the effects are long lasting. Our findings suggest potential long-term effects of ecstasy use, in conjunction with other recreational drugs, on nigrostriatal dopaminergic functions. Further longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the significance of these findings as they may have important public health implications. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"1424","0","Effect of different doses of esketamine compared with fentanyl combined with propofol on hypotension in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial.^
BACKGROUND: Opioids analgesics commonly used in abortion procedures are associated with respiratory and circulatory depression. Esketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist and a common analgesic. The drug has several advantages including rapid onset and offset and it causes minimal cardiorespiratory depression. However, studies have not explored the effects of esketamine in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery. Therefore, the present study sought to evaluate the effect of different doses of esketamine compared with the effect of fentanyl on incidence of perioperative hypotension in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery and to explore the optimal esketamine dose for this population. METHODS: A total of 178 female patients undergoing painless abortion surgery were enrolled to the current study. The patients were aged 18-45 years, had a body mass index (BMI) of 18-28 kg m(- 2) and a class I or II physical status as determined using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) system. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups as follows: group F (n = 45) in which patients underwent intravenous (IV) administration of 1 μg kg(- 1) fentanyl followed by IV administration of 2 mg kg(- 1) propofol, and group EL, group EM and group EH (n = 45, 44, 44) with patients receiving IV administration of 0.2 mg kg(- 1), 0.25 mg kg(- 1), 0.3 mg kg(- 1) esketamine, respectively, followed by IV administration of 2 mg kg(- 1) propofol. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of hypotension whereas secondary outcomes included incidence of adverse events, perioperative changes of vital signs, anesthesia induction time, recovery time and dischargeable time, propofol addition, as well as patient, surgeon and anesthesiologist satisfaction levels. RESULTS: The findings showed that the incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH (0, 0, 0%) relative to the incidence in patients in group F (20%) (χ(2) = 19.648; P = 0.000). In this study, the incidence of hypoxia of subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH (0, 2.3, 2.3%) was significantly lower compared with that of patients in group F (11.1%) (χ(2) = 8.622; P = 0.035). The findings indicated that the incidence of somatic motor reactions was significantly lower in participants in group EM and group EH (9.1, 4.5%) relative to that of patients in group F and group EL (26.7, 15.6%) (χ(2) = 10.254; P = 0.016). The results showed that the incidence of nausea and vomiting and potential psychiatric symptoms were significantly higher in patients in group EH (15.9, 11.4%) compared with that of participants in group F (2.2, 0%), group EL (4.4, 0%) and group EM (2.3, 2.3%) (χ(2) = 7.493; P = 0.038 and χ(2) = 8.248; P = 0.003). In this study, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH were more stable compared with that of patients in group F. Frequency of the additional propofol dose was markedly less in group EM and EH (26.7%, 17,8%) compared with that in group F and EL (9.1, 4.5%) (χ(2) = 10.254; P = 0.016). The findings indicated that the dischargeable time was significantly shorter for patients in group EM compared with that of subjects in group F, group EL and group EH. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study showed that single-dose esketamine (0.25 mg kg(- 1)) effectively decreased incidence of hypotension and total adverse events and reduced the frequency of additional propofol dose required for patients undergoing painless abortion with preservation of physician-patient satisfaction."
"6085","1","Ibogaine in the Treatment of Alcoholism: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Escalating-dose, Phase 2 Trial.^
Approximately 5% of the world's adult population has some alcohol‐related disorder, which in addition is associated with 3% of all deaths in the world. In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12 alcoholic patients. Each patient will be hospitalized for 20 days and receive 3 increasing doses of ibogaine. The first 3 patients will receive oral doses of 20 to 400 mg of ibogaine in an open‐label design. If the 3 higher doses (240, 320 and 400 mg) are well tolerated, the next 9 volunteers will receive these doses or placebo randomly. The volunteers will also be evaluated 7, 14 and 21 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after leaving the hospital to monitor the consumption of alcohol and other drugs."

There is evidence for ketamine use in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Several safety concerns arise regarding adverse drug reactions in specific subpopulations. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of intravenous ketamine treatment in relation to dissociative and psychotic measures in TRD inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar depression (BP) with comorbidities. In total, 49 inpatients with MDD or BP were treated with ketamine following the registered naturalistic observational protocol in a tertiary reference unit for mood disorders (NCT04226963). This dataset represents an intermittent analysis of an observational study performed for interim modeling of observational learning. The observations were applied to the inhomogeneous TRD population in a single site with no blinding and were limited to acute administration. The presence of epilepsy was significantly associated with an elevation in the BPRS over time (p = 0.008). Psychotic symptomatology with BPRS scores for comorbid conditions excluding epilepsy turned out to be insignificant (p = 0.198) regardless of the diagnosis. However, for a subgroup of patients with epilepsy (n = 6), a substantial fluctuation was seen across all administrations in the time course of the study. The study results contribute to the literature on the safety and tolerability profile of CNS adverse drug reactions in short-term treatment with intravenous ketamine as an add-on intervention to current standard-of-care psychotropic medication in TRD-MDD and TRD-BP inpatients with comorbidities. The careful consideration of comorbidities and concomitant medication is needed with ketamine administration along with close-clinical supervision at every visit."

Recent research suggests that psychedelic drugs can be powerful agents of change when utilized in conjunction with psychotherapy. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy has been studied as a means of helping people overcome posttraumatic stress disorder, believed to work by reducing fear of traumatic memories and increasing feelings of trust and compassion toward others, without inhibiting access to difficult emotions. However,research studies for psychedelic psychotherapies have largely excluded people of color, leaving important questions unaddressed for these populations. At the University of Connecticut, we participated as a study site in a MAPS-sponsored, FDA-reviewed Phase 2 open-label multi site study, with a focus on providing culturally informed care to people of color. We discuss the development of a study site focused on the ethnic minority trauma experience,including assessment of racial trauma, design of informed consent documents to improve understanding and acceptability to people of color, diversification of the treatment team, ongoing training for team members, validation of participant experiences of racial oppression at a cultural and individual level, examination of the setting and music used during sessions for cultural congruence, training for the independent rater pool, community outreach, and institutional resistance. We also discuss next steps in ensuring that access to culturally informed care is prioritized as MDMA and other psychedelics move into late phase trials, including the importance of diverse sites and training focused on therapy providers of color.

This article describes the teenage vision of the founder of the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) that humanity's future would be aided by the therapeutic and spiritual potential of psychedelic substances. The article traces the trajectory of MAPS from inception in 1986 to its present, noting future goals with respect to research, outreach, and harm reduction. MAPS was created as a non-profit psychedelic pharmaceutical company in response to the 1985 scheduling of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). Overcoming many hurdles, MAPS developed the first double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and plans for FDA prescription approval in 2021. MAPS' program of research expanded to include a trial of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-assisted psychotherapy for anxiety when facing life-threatening illness, observational studies of ibogaine in the treatment of addiction, and studies of MDMA for social anxiety in people with autism spectrum disorders. MAPS meets the challenges of drug development through a clinical research team led by a former Novartis drug development professional experienced in the conduct, monitoring, and analysis of clinical trials. MAPS' harm-reduction efforts are intended to avoid backlash and build a post-prohibition world by assisting non-medical users to transform difficult psychedelic experiences into opportunities for growth."

This paper presents original research on prevalence, user characteristics and effect profile of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a potent hallucinogenic which acts primarily through the serotonergic system. Data were obtained from the Global Drug Survey (an anonymous online survey of people, many of whom have used drugs) conducted between November and December 2012 with 22,289 responses. Lifetime prevalence of DMT use was 8.9% (n=1980) and past year prevalence use was 5.0% (n=1123). We explored the effect profile of DMT in 472 participants who identified DMT as the last new drug they had tried for the first time and compared it with ratings provided by other respondents on psilocybin (magic mushrooms), LSD and ketamine. DMT was most often smoked and offered a strong, intense, short-lived psychedelic high with relatively few negative effects or ""come down"". It had a larger proportion of new users compared with the other substances (24%), suggesting its popularity may increase. Overall, DMT seems to have a very desirable effect profile indicating a high abuse liability that maybe offset by a low urge to use more. © The Author(s) 2013."

(R,S)-MDMA (40 mg) was administered to eight normally hydrated healthy male volunteers (22-32 years) and blood samples were collected up to 24 h. Plasma was assayed for AVP and cortisol by radioimmunoassays, and for MDMA and the N-demethylated metabolite, MDA, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sodium concentrations and osmolality were also determined. Plasma AVP increased in all subjects after MDMA administration and a significant negative correlation was observed between concentrations of AVP and both single and total enantiomer MDMA at 1 h (r < -0.91, P < 0.01). This had disappeared by 2 h (P > 0.7). Compared with basal values, no significant change was observed for osmolality or cortisol at 1 h after drug administration. In conclusion, plasma AVP concentrations increase after MDMA administration, but the increase is not part of a generalized stress response since cortisol did not increase concurrently. A significant negative correlation between plasma MDMA and AVP was observed soon after administration. The possibility that a pharmacological effect of MDMA is primarily mediated via one or more metabolites, rather than by the parent drug, should be considered."

The effects of stimulant drugs on risk-taking behavior vary across individuals, even in healthy samples. These differences could relate to personality, which may share common mechanisms with drug effects or impulsive, risk-taking behavior. The current study investigated the role of temperament and gender in the effects of amphetamine on risk taking. Forty healthy men and women, aged 18 to 35, completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) with three reward values after ingesting placebo or d-amphetamine (10, 20 mg). They completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF; Patrick et al., 2002), with three main scales: Trait reward sensitivity (Agentic Positive Emotionality; AgPEM), impulsivity (Constraint; CON), and negative affect (Negative Emotionality; NEM). d-Amphetamine (20 mg) decreased risk behavior in low AgPEM males, but increased risk behavior in high AgPEM males, producing positive correlations with AgPEM in men (r >= +.55, p <.05). The drug did not affect risk-taking in women. There was evidence of discriminant validity between the AgPEM, NEM, and CON dimensions and behavioral responses to amphetamine. Implications for treatment and addiction are discussed."
"5375","1","Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of depressive symptoms after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is a general anaesthetic with anti-depressant effects at subanaesthetic doses. We hypothesised that intraoperative administration of ketamine would prevent or mitigate postoperative depressive symptoms in surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomised clinical trial testing the effects of intraoperative administration of ketamine [0.5 mg kg(-1) (Lo-K) or 1.0 mg kg(-1) (Hi-K)] vs control [saline placebo (P)] in patients ≥60 yr old undergoing major surgery with general anaesthesia. We administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 before the operation, on postoperative day (POD) 3 (primary outcome), and on POD30 to assess depressive symptoms, a secondary outcome of the original trial. RESULTS: There was no significant difference on POD3 in the proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of depression between the placebo [23/156 (14.7%)] and combined ketamine (Lo-K plus Hi-K) [61/349 (17.5%)] groups [difference = -2.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0% to -9.4%; P=0.446]. Of the total cohort, 9.6% (64/670; 95% CI, 7.6-12.0%) had symptoms suggestive of depression before operation, which increased to 16.6% (84/505; 95% CI, 13.6-20.1%) on POD3, and decreased to 11.9% (47/395; 95% CI, 9.1-15.5%) on POD30. Of the patients with depressive symptoms on POD3 and POD30, 51% and 49%, respectively, had no prior history of depression or depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Major surgery is associated with new-onset symptoms suggestive of depression in patients ≥60 yr old. Intraoperative administration of subanaesthetic ketamine does not appear to prevent or improve depressive symptoms. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01690988."
"51","1","Severe Neurological Sequelae after a Recreational Dose of LSD.^
A young man with an unremarkable medical history suffered a seizure with subsequent cardiorespiratory arrest and severe neurological sequelae after ingesting a blotter. Analysis of a similar blotter and a serum sample obtained 3 h after the event detected lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at an amount of 300 μg in the blotter and at a concentration of 4.0 ng/mL (12.4 nmol/L) in the serum. No other drugs were present in concentrations which may confer significant effects. In addition, no individual traits which would make the patient particularly susceptible to adverse LSD effects have subsequently been identified. This suggests that LSD may confer toxic effects in previously healthy individuals."
"4564","1","Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KPT) of alcoholism.^
Ketamine is a drug for general anesthesia, but in subanesthetic doses it induces profound psychedelic experiences and hallucinations. This property of ketamine was exploited in our use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for alcoholism. The results of the clinical trial testify to a considerable increase in the efficacy of alcoholism treatment owing to ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT): a total abstinence for more than one year was observed in 73 out of 111 (65.8%) alcoholic patients of the KPT group, compared to 24% (24 out of 100 patients) of the conventional treatment control group (p < 0.01). The studies of the underlying psychological mechanisms of KPT have demonstrated that the ketamine-assisted psychedelic therapy of alcoholic patients induces a harmonization of the MMPI personality profile, positive transformation of non-verbalized (mostly unrealized) self-concept and emotional attitudes to various aspects of self and to other people, positive changes of life values and purposes, important insights into the meaning of life and a rise in the level of spiritual development. These psychological changes favored sober life. The data of biochemical investigations showed that the pharmacological action of KPT affects both monoaminergic and opiodergic neurotransmitter metabolism i.e., those neurochemical systems which are involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. The data of EEG computer-assisted analysis have shown that ketamine increases theta-activity in brain cortical regions of alcoholic patients. This is evidence of the reinforcement of limbic-cortex interaction during the KPT session."
"8100","1","Characterization and prediction of acute and sustained response to psychedelic psilocybin in a mindfulness group retreat.^
Meditation and psychedelics have played key roles in humankind's search for self-transcendence and personal change. However, neither their possible synergistic effects, nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied. To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315 μg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n = 39) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes. A better comprehension of mechanisms underlying most beneficial psychedelic experiences may guide therapeutic interventions across numerous mental conditions in the form of psychedelic-assisted applications."
"1770","1","Glycine transporter inhibitor attenuates the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in healthy males: preliminary evidence.^
Enhancing glutamate function by stimulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with glycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings provide preliminary support for further study of the antipsychotic potential of GlyT1 inhibitors."
"7300","1","Determination of Ketamine and Norketamine in Hair and Evaluation of Polydrug Use in Ketamine Abusers Using Hair Analysis in Korea.^
This study evaluated hair samples from 28 subjects who tested positive for ketamine at Seoul Institute National Forensic Service in Korea between 2016 and 2017. Ketamine in the hair was extracted using a solution of 1% hydrochloric acid in methanol for 16 h. Extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The LC-MS-MS method was validated by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, intra- and inter-accuracy, precision and matrix effect. In 59 ketamine-positive hair or hair segments from 28 ketamine abusers, the ketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.011-335.8 ng/mg (mean, 13.6; median, 1.8), and the norketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.001-35.7 ng/mg (mean, 7.5; median, 0.44). The ratio of norketamine to ketamine concentrations in hair was in the range of 0.01-1.46 (mean, 0.34; median, 0.26). The distribution of ketamine concentration in hair samples was as follows: 0.01-0.1 ng/mg in 11 samples (18.6%), 0.1-5 ng/mg in 33 samples (55.9%), 5-10 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 10-15 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 15-20 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 40-45 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 45-50 ng/mg in 1 sample (1.7%) and >100 ng/mg in only 2 samples (3.4%). In the hair of ketamine abusers, 26 of 28 subjects were detected simultaneously ketamine with other drugs, including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; n = 9), methamphetamine (MA; n = 3), MDMA/MA (n = 3), MDMA/para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA; n = 3), MDMA/PMA/MA (n = 2), cocaine (n = 1) and other drugs (n = 5, propofol, zolpidem or benzodiazepines). Along with ketamine, other controlled drugs were detected in most of the hair samples: MDMA (60.7%), MA (28.6%), PMA (17.9%), zolpidem (17.9%) and propofol (14.3%) in the frequency of abuse. In conclusion, most of the ketamine abusers (92.9%) were polydrug abusers, who were concomitantly abusing other controlled substances."

The aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE (3,4-methylene dioxyethamphetamine) on cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers and to correlate neurometabolism with acute psychopathology. In a randomized double-blind trial, 15 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 110-120 min after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). Two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, constant cognitive stimulation was started and maintained for 32 min using a word repetition paradigm to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral glucose uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using Tl-weighted 3D flash magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by manual regionalization into 108 regions of interest and PET/MRI overlay. After absolute quantification of rMRGlu and normalization to global metabolism, normalized rMRGlu under MDE was compared to placebo using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Acute psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and rMRGlu was correlated to PANSS scores according to Spearman. MDE subjects showed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, P < 0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, P < 0.05). On the other hand, rMRGlu was significantly increased in the bilateral cerebellum (right: +10.1%, P < 0.05; left: +7.6%, P < 0.05) and in the right putamen (+6.2%, P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity (r = 0.87, P < 0.05), both the right amygdala (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) and the left posterior cingulate (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) to difficulties in abstract thinking, and the right frontal inferior (r = 0.85, P < 0.05), right anterior cingulate (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), and left anterior cingulate (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) to attentional deficits. A negative correlation was found between the left frontal operculum (Broca's area) and attentional deficits (r = -0.85, P < 0.05). The present study revealed acute neurometabolic changes under the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE, indicating a frontostriatocerebellar imbalance paralleling other psychotropic substances or various psychiatric disorders."
"7956","1","Side-effects associated with ketamine use in depression: a systematic review.^
This is the first systematic review of the safety of ketamine in the treatment of depression after single and repeated doses. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases and identified 288 articles, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. After acute dosing, psychiatric, psychotomimetic, cardiovascular, neurological, and other side-effects were more frequently reported after ketamine treatment than after placebo in patients with depresssion. Our findings suggest a selective reporting bias with limited assessment of long-term use and safety and after repeated dosing, despite these being reported in other patient groups exposed to ketamine (eg, those with chronic pain) and in recreational users. We recommend large-scale clinical trials that include multiple doses of ketamine and long-term follow up to assess the safety of long-term regular use."
"7253","1","Ketamine as a potential treatment for suicidal ideation: a systematic review of the literature.^
OBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of suicidal ideation (SI). METHODS: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched up to January 2015 for clinical trials and case reports describing therapeutic ketamine administration to patients presenting with SI/suicidality. Searches were also conducted for relevant background material regarding the pharmacological function of ketamine. RESULTS: Nine publications (six studies and three case reports) met the search criteria for assessing SI after administration of subanesthetic ketamine. There were no studies examining the effect on suicide attempts or death by suicide. Each study demonstrated a rapid and clinically significant reduction in SI, with results similar to previously described data on ketamine and treatment-resistant depression. A total of 137 patients with SI have been reported in the literature as receiving therapeutic ketamine. Seven studies delivered a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenously over 40 min, while one study administered a 0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and another study administered a liquid suspension. The earliest significant results were seen after 40 min, and the longest results were observed up to 10 days postinfusion. CONCLUSION: Consistent with clinical research on ketamine as a rapid and effective treatment for depression, ketamine has shown early preliminary evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms, as well as reducing SI, with minimal short-term side effects. Additional studies are needed to further investigate its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, and long-term adverse effects (including abuse) and benefits. In addition, ketamine could potentially be used as a prototype for further development of rapid-acting antisuicidal medication with a practical route of administration and the most favorable risk/benefit ratio."
"4204","0","The Effect of MDMA-Induced Anxiety on Neuronal Apoptosis in Adult Male Rats' Hippocampus.^
Ecstasy or MDMA as a psychoactive drug and hallucinogen is considered one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. This psychotropic substance is discussed both as sexually stimulating and reducing fear and anxiety. Amphetamines also destroy neurons in some brain areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of MDMA on anxiety and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Forty-two male Wistar rats of mean weight 200-220 g were used and distributed into six groups [control, control-saline, and experimental groups (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg)]. Rats in experimental groups received MDMA at different doses for seven days by intraperitoneal injection and the control-saline group received saline (1 ml/kg); anxiety was then investigated by plus-maze test. Forty-eight hours after behavioural testing brains were taken from animals and fixed, and after tissue processing, slices were stained with TUNEL kit for apoptotic cells. The area densities of apoptotic neurons were measured throughout the hippocampus and compared in all groups (P < 0.05). Physiological studies showed that 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg doses caused anti-anxiety behaviour and 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of MDMA caused anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, our histological study showed that ecstasy increased apoptotic cell numbers and the highest increase was observed with the 10 mg/kg dose of MDMA. We concluded that MDMA can cause different responses of anxiety-like behaviour in different doses. This phenomenon causes a different ratio of apoptosis in hippocampal formation. Reduction of anxiety-like behaviour induced by the 2.5 mg/kg dose of MDMA can control apoptosis."
"1485","0","Adding ketamine in a multimodal patient-controlled epidural regimen reduces postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.^
We designed this double-blind study to evaluate the effect of adding small-dose ketamine in a multimodal regimen of postoperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Ninety-one patients, ASA physical status I-III, undergoing major surgery, received a standardized general anesthesia and epidural catheterization in an appropriate intervertebral space after surgery. A PCEA device was programmed to deliver a regimen of morphine 0.02 mg/mL, bupivacaine 0.8 mg/mL, and epinephrine 4 microg/mL, with the addition of ketamine 0.4 mg/mL (ketamine, n = 45) or without (control, n = 46). The mean visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores during cough or movement for the first 3 days after surgery were higher in the control group than in the ketamine group (P < 0.05), whereas the mean VAS score at rest for the first 2 days were higher in the control group than in the ketamine group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients in the control group consumed more multimodal analgesics than patients in the ketamine group for the first 2 days (P < 0.05). The sedation scores and the incidence of side effects (pruritus, nausea, emesis, sleep deprivation, motor block, and respiration depression) were similar between the two groups. We conclude that adding ketamine 0.4 mg/mL in a multimodal PCEA regimen provides better postoperative pain relief and decreases consumption of analgesics. IMPLICATIONS: Many studies have evaluated one or a combination of two analgesics for postoperative pain control, but few have examined a multimodal approach using three or four different epidural analgesics. This study demonstrates an additive analgesic effect when ketamine is added to a multimodal analgesic treatment."
"1135","1","Subacute effects of a single dose of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans: An open-label preliminary investigation.^
RATIONALE: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic that has gained prominent attention recently as a potential therapeutic for neuropsychiatric disorders including Major Depressive Disorder. Pre-clinical and initial studies in humans suggest that serotonin 2A receptor agonists, including serotonergic psychedelics, have anti-inflammatory effects. This may contribute to its therapeutic effects as previous studies indicate a link between neuropsychiatric disorders and inflammatory processes. However, the effect of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation has not been evaluated in humans. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on peripheral biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 16 healthy participants before and one day after the administration of a single oral dose of psilocybin (mean dose: 0.22 mg/kg) and subsequently analyzed for concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Change in inflammatory markers was evaluated using a paired t-test where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significant changes in any of the above biomarkers of inflammation (all Cohen's d ≤ 0.31; all p ≥ 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support that a single dose of psilocybin reduces biomarkers of inflammation in healthy individuals one day after administration. Nevertheless, we suggest that future studies consider additional markers of inflammation, including markers of neuroinflammation, and evaluate potential anti-inflammatory effects of psilocybin therapy in clinical cohorts where more prominent effects may be observable."
"6870","1","Intranasal ketamine for acute Cluster headache attacks-Results from a proof-of-concept open label trial.^
Background and objective: Acute treatment options for Cluster headache patients who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited. Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a Cluster headache attack but never systematically tested. Methods: We conducted an open‐label pilot study in which 20 chronic Cluster headache patients according to International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd were treated during one cluster headache attack with intranasal ketamine. Under in‐hospital observation patients received 15 mg ketamine by intranasal spray every six minutes a maximum of five times. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction of pain intensity within 15 minutes after initiating treatment. Results: The primary endpoint was not met. However, 30 minutes after first application the pain intensity was reduced by 59% from 7.25 ± 1.24 to 2.94 ± 3.40 on a 1 1 points numeric rating scale (mean, SD, p = 0.0002) and 11 out of 16 (69%) scored four or below on the numeric rating scale. Exactly, half the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection and complete relief was self‐reported by 8 out of 20 patients (40%). No serious advense events were identified during the trial. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment of cluster headache within 30 minutes but should be tested in a larger controlled design. Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine."
"4354","1","Prosocial effects of MDMA: A measure of generosity.^
BACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces ""prosocial"" effects that contribute to its recreational use. Few studies have examined the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms by which MDMA produces these effects. Here we examined the effect of MDMA on a specific prosocial effect, i.e. generosity, using a task in which participants make decisions about whether they or another person will receive money (Welfare Trade-Off Task; WTT). METHODS: The project included one study without drug administration and one with MDMA. In Study 1, we administered the WTT to healthy adults (N = 361) and examined their performance in relation to measures of personality and socioeconomic status. In Study 2, healthy volunteers with MDMA experience (N = 32) completed the WTT after MDMA administration (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg). RESULTS: As expected, in both studies participants were more generous with a close friend than an acquaintance or stranger. In Study 1, WTT generosity was related to household income and trait Agreeableness. In Study 2, MDMA (1.0 mg/kg) increased generosity toward a friend but not a stranger, whereas MDMA (0.5 mg/kg) slightly increased generosity toward a stranger, especially among female participants. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the WTT is a valuable, novel tool to assess a component of prosocial behavior, i.e. generosity to others. The findings support growing evidence that MDMA produces prosocial effects, but, as with oxytocin, these appear to depend on the social proximity of the relationships. The brain mechanisms underlying the construct of generosity, or the effects of MDMA on this measure, remain to be determined."
"2871","0","The Montreal model: an integrative biomedical-psychedelic approach to ketamine for severe treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Subanesthetic ketamine has accumulated meta-analytic evidence for rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), resulting in both excitement and debate. Many unanswered questions surround ketamine's mechanisms of action and its integration into real-world psychiatric care, resulting in diverse utilizations that variously resemble electroconvulsive therapy, conventional antidepressants, or serotonergic psychedelics. There is thus an unmet need for clinical approaches to ketamine that are tailored to its unique therapeutic properties. METHODS: This article presents the Montreal model, a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to ketamine for severe TRD refined over 6 years in public healthcare settings. To contextualize its development, we review the evidence for ketamine as a biomedical and as a psychedelic treatment of depression, emphasizing each perspectives' strengths, weaknesses, and distinct methods of utilization. We then describe the key clinical experiences and research findings that shaped the model's various components, which are presented in detail. RESULTS: The Montreal model, as implemented in a recent randomized clinical trial, aims to synergistically pair ketamine infusions with conventional and psychedelic biopsychosocial care. Ketamine is broadly conceptualized as a brief intervention that can produce windows of opportunity for enhanced psychiatric care, as well as powerful occasions for psychological growth. The model combines structured psychiatric care and concomitant psychotherapy with six ketamine infusions, administered with psychedelic-inspired nonpharmacological adjuncts including rolling preparative and integrative psychological support. DISCUSSION: Our integrative model aims to bridge the biomedical-psychedelic divide to offer a feasible, flexible, and standardized approach to ketamine for TRD. Our learnings from developing and implementing this psychedelic-inspired model for severe, real-world patients in two academic hospitals may offer valuable insights for the ongoing roll-out of a range of psychedelic therapies. Further research is needed to assess the Montreal model's effectiveness and hypothesized psychological mechanisms."

Recent studies have hypothesized that peripheral glutamate receptors could be implicated in deep craniofacial pain conditions. In this study 18 temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia patients received intra-articular injections of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine, or normal saline to study in a cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled manner the effect on TMJ pain and somatosensory function. Spontaneous pain and pain on jaw function was scored by patients on 0–10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) for up to 24 h. Quantitative sensory tests (QST): tactile, pin-prick, pressure pain threshold and pressure pain tolerance were used for assessment of somatosensory function at baseline and up to 15 min after injections. There were no significant effects of intra-articular ketamine over time on spontaneous VAS pain measures (ANOVA: P = 0.532), pain on jaw opening (ANOVA: P = 0.384), or any of the somatosensory measures (ANOVA: P > 0.188). The poor effect of ketamine could be due to involvement of non-NMDA receptors in the pain mechanism and/or ongoing pain and central sensitization independent of peripheral nociceptive input. In conclusion, there appears to be no rationale to use intra-articular ketamine injections in TMJ arthralgia patients, and peripheral NMDA receptors may play a minor role in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

A gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used for the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) metabolites in plasma and urine samples after the administration of 100 mg MDMA to healthy volunteers. Samples were hydrolyzed prior to a solid-phase extraction with Bond Elut Certify columns. Analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate (2% ammonium hydroxide) and analyzed as their trifluoroacyl derivatives. Linear calibration curves were obtained at plasma and urine concentration ranges of 25-400 ng/mL and 250-2000 ng/mL for MDMA and HMMA, and of 2.5-40 ng/mL and 100-1000 ng/mL for MDA and HMA. Following the same urine preparation procedure but without the derivatization step, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for enantiomerical resolution of compounds was developed using (2-hydroxy)propyl-beta-cyclodextrin at two different concentrations (10 and 50mM in 50mM H3PO4, pH 2.5) as chiral selector. Calibration curves for the CE method were prepared with the corresponding racemic mixture and were linear between 125 and 2000 ng/mL, 50 and 1000 ng/mL, and 125 and 1500 ng/mL for each enantiomer of MDMA, MDA, and HMMA, respectively. Stereoselective disposition of MDMA and MDA was confirmed. HMMA disposition seems to be in apparent contradiction with MDMA findings as the enantiomer ratio is close to 1 and constant over the time."

"1766","0","Effects of haloperidol on the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, motor, and neuroendocrine effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol in humans.^
INTRODUCTION: Cannabinoids produce a spectrum of effects in humans including euphoria, cognitive impairments, psychotomimetic effects, and perceptual alterations. The extent to which dopaminergic systems contribute to the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) remains unclear. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist altered the effects of Delta-9-THC in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 2-test-day double-blind study, 28 subjects including healthy subjects (n = 17) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 11) were administered active (0.057 mg/kg) or placebo oral haloperidol in random order followed 90 and 215 min later by fixed order intravenous administration of placebo (vehicle) and active (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta-9-THC, respectively. RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports, intravenous Delta-9-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects including ""high."" Delta-9-THC also impaired verbal recall and attention. Haloperidol pretreatment did not reduce any of the behavioral effects of Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol worsened the immediate free and delayed free and cued recall deficits produced by Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol and Delta-9-THC worsened distractibility and vigilance. Neither drug impaired performance on a motor screening task, the Stockings of Cambridge task, or the delayed match to sample task. Frequent users had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels and blunted Delta-9-THC induced memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious effects of haloperidol pretreatment on the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC are consistent with the preclinical literature in suggesting crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems. However, it is unlikely that DA D(2) receptor mechanisms play a major role in mediating the psychotomimetic and perceptual altering effects of Delta-9-THC. Further investigation is warranted to understand the basis of the psychotomimetic effects of Delta-9-THC and to better understand the crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems."
"7192","1","Dose-related behavioral, subjective, endocrine, and psychophysiological effects of the κ opioid agonist Salvinorin A in humans.^
BACKGROUND: Salvia divinorum (Salvia) is an increasingly popular recreational drug amongst adolescents and young adults. Its primary active ingredient, Salvinorin A (SA)-a highly selective agonist at the κ opiate receptor-is believed to be one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. However, there is little experimental data on the effects of SA in humans. METHODS: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy individuals who had previously used Salvia. RESULTS: SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations, including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood. SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects. The perceptual altering effects and lack of euphoric effects would explain its intermittent use pattern. Such a profile would also suggest a low addictive potential similar to other hallucinogens and consistent with κ opiate receptor agonism. Further work is warranted to carefully characterize a full spectrum of its effects in humans, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved, and to explore the basis for individual variability in its effects."
"3549","0","Depression, Mindfulness, and Psilocybin: Possible Complementary Effects of Mindfulness Meditation and Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression. A Review.^
Depression is a major public health problem that affects approximately 4.4% of the global population. Since conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are only partially effective, as demonstrated by the number of patients failing to achieve remission, alternative treatments are needed. Mindfulness meditation (MM) and psilocybin represent two promising novel treatments that might even have complementary therapeutic effects when combined. Since the current literature is limited to theoretical and empirical underpinnings of either treatment alone, the present review aimed to identify possible complementary effects that may be relevant to the treatment of depression. To that end, the individual effects of MM and psilocybin, and their underlying working mechanisms, were compared on a non-exhaustive selection of six prominent psychological and biological processes that are well known to show impairments in patients suffering from major depression disorder, that is mood, executive functioning, social skills, neuroplasticity, core neural networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological levels. Based on predefined search strings used in two online databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) 1129 articles were identified. After screening title and abstract for relevance related to the question, 82 articles were retained and 11 were added after reference list search, resulting in 93 articles included in the review. Findings show that MM and psilocybin exert similar effects on mood, social skills, and neuroplasticity; different effects were found on executive functioning, neural core networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmune system markers. Potential mechanisms of MM's effects are enhanced affective self-regulation through mental strategies, optimization of stress reactivity, and structural and functional adjustments of prefrontal and limbic areas; psilocybin's effects might be established via attenuation of cognitive associations through deep personal insights, cognitive disinhibition, and global neural network disintegration. It is suggested that, when used in combination, MM and psilocybin could exert complementary effects by potentiating or prolonging mutual positive effects, for example, MM potentially facilitating psilocybin-induced peak experiences. Future placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trials focusing on psilocybin-assisted mindfulness-based therapy will provide knowledge about whether the proposed combination of therapies maximizes their efficacy in the treatment of depression or depressive symptomatology."

"5584","1","Ketamine vs Electroconvulsive Therapy for Major Depressive Episode: A Systematic Review and Meta-analysis.^
IMPORTANCE: The relative efficacy of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with major depressive episode (MDE) needs clarification. OBJECTIVE: To compare depression rating outcomes with ketamine vs ECT in adults with MDE and to compare response and remission rates, number of sessions to response and remission, and adverse effects. DATA SOURCES: Two investigators independently systematically searched MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases using a combination of relevant Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text keywords from database inception through May 15, 2022, to identify relevant English-language trials. STUDY SELECTION: Parallel-group randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. One-week posttreatment outcomes were pooled as standardized mean difference (SMD; Hedges g) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for categorical outcomes in random-effects meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy outcomes were 1-week (or nearest) posttreatment depression ratings, 1-week (or nearest) study-defined response and remission rates, and number of sessions to treatment response and remission. Safety outcomes were reported adverse effects. RESULTS: Five trials (ketamine group: n = 141; ECT group: n = 137) were meta-analyzed. The overall pooled SMD for posttreatment depression ratings was -0.39 (95% CI, -0.81 to 0.02; I2 = 45%; 5 RCTs). For this efficacy outcome, in a sensitivity analysis of methodologically stronger trials, ECT was superior to ketamine (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.14; I2 = 6%; 2 RCTs). ECT was also superior to ketamine for study-defined response (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs) and remission (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.82; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs) rates. No significant differences were noted between groups for number of sessions to response and remission and for cognitive outcomes. Key limitations were small number of studies, limited sample size, and high risk of bias in all trials. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest an efficacy advantage for ECT over ketamine in adults with MDE. These conclusions are tempered by the small number and size of existing trials."
"9122","0","Psilocybin in Palliative Care: An Update.^
PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes clinically and socially relevant developments over the past five years in the therapeutic use of the classical tryptamine psychedelic substance psilocybin, with respect to the common challenges faced by palliative care patients and their care teams. Psilocybin is available in whole fungal and isolated forms but is not yet approved for therapeutic use in the United States. Using targeted database and gray literature searches, and author recall, key sources were identified, reviewed, and synthesized as to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in palliative care. RECENT FINDINGS: Life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses and faced by palliative care patients are comorbid with emotional and spiritual distress. Research and field reports reviewed suggest that psilocybin has significant and in some cases, sustained anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects with a favorable safety profile. Limitations of the research include the risk for selection bias toward healthy, white, financially privileged individuals, and in general, follow-up timelines too short to appropriately evaluate durability of outcomes in psychospiritual benefits and quality of life. SUMMARY: While more research is needed for palliative care populations specifically, reasonable inferences can be made regarding the potential for benefit to palliative care patients from psilocybin's demonstrated anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects. However, major legal, ethical and financial barriers to access exist for the general population; obstacles which are likely worsened for geriatric and palliative care patients. Empiric treatment and large-scale controlled trials of psilocybin should be conducted to further investigate the findings of the smaller studies reviewed here across a variety of populations, for a greater understanding of therapeutic benefit and clinically relevant safety criteria, and to support thoughtful legalization and medical access."
"6062","1","Intrathecal Ketamine, Dexmedetomidine and Both With Bupivacaine for Postoperative Abdominal Cancer Surgery Pain.^
This study was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I‐II patients aged 30‐50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 ‐10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16‐gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2 saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a 25‐gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2‐3 or L3‐4 interspaces. Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30 patients each: ‐ The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. ‐ The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally. ‐ Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5‐2 µg/kg, propofol 2‐3 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis‐atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1‐ 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis‐atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative. VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS ≥ 3) followed by 1 mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient‐care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required. Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine 0.01 mg/kg."
"1510","1","Safety, tolerability, and clinical and neural effects of single-dose psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover trial.^
BACKGROUND: Psilocybin may help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To date, only one open-label study of psilocybin for OCD exists, necessitating further investigation with a randomized controlled design. The neural correlates of psilocybin's effects on OCD have also not been studied. OBJECTIVES: This first-of-its-kind trial aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of psilocybin in the treatment of OCD, provide preliminary evidence on the effects of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, and elucidate neural mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's effects on OCD. DESIGN: We use a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover design to examine the clinical and neural effects of either a single dose of oral psilocybin (0.25 mg/kg) or active placebo-control agent (250 mg of niacin) on OCD symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are enrolling 30 adult participants at a single site in Connecticut, USA who have failed at least one trial of standard care treatment (medication/psychotherapy) for OCD. All participants will also receive unstructured, non-directive psychological support during visits. Aside from safety, primary outcomes include OCD symptoms over the past 24 h, assessed by the Acute Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and Visual Analog Scale ratings. These are collected by blinded, independent raters at baseline and the primary endpoint of 48 h post-dosing. Total follow-up is 12 weeks post-dosing. Resting state neuroimaging data will be collected at baseline and primary endpoint. Participants randomized to placebo will be offered the chance to return for an open-label dose of 0.25 mg/kg. ETHICS STATEMENT: All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The trial (protocol v. 5.2) was approved by the institutional review board (HIC #2000020355) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03356483). DISCUSSION: This study may represent an advance in our ability to treat refractory OCD, and pave the way for future studies of neurobiological mechanisms of OCD that may respond to psilocybin."

This integrative review was conducted to summarize the knowledge pertaining to the effects that serotonergic psychedelics can have on creativity, a multi-dimensional construct referring to the ability to produce original and valuable artifacts. Psychedelics, which have long been hailed as substances that can enhance the creative process in their users, have experienced a recent resurgence in research, allowing the opportunity to better understand this relationship. To this end, I reviewed literature which attempted to study the effects of serotonergic psychedelics on creativity through psychometric methods. A total of eleven studies were reviewed, with four psychedelic compounds represented. Every study assessed components and subcomponents of divergent and convergent thinking, with only one instance of product assessment. Results suggest that convergent thinking may increase during the post-acute phases of the drugs' intake, fostering the capacity for development of previously generated ideas. However, this evidence may be circumstantial based on the low number of studies available, small sample sizes, overall lack of randomized controlled trials, and significant methodological limitations throughout most studies. Potential mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, along with the current state of the research and implications for future studies."

The aim of the present chapter is to shed light on different aspects related to synaptic dopamine and clinical effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). MDMA is a psychoactive stimulant abused by young people worldwide. Numerous studies demonstrated circulating catecholamine concentrations increase after MDMA administration, indicating sympathetic system activation modulating psychomotor and neuroendocrine function. Its mechanism of action at synaptic terminals of the dopaminergic system is strongly similar to a cocaine-like effect attributable to an inhibition of the plasma membrane transporters for dopamine (DAT) and to an increased extracellular concentration of serotonin (5-HT). Clinical and preclinical studies have investigated the effects of repeated MDMA exposure. It produces neuroadaptive responses at both serotoninergic and dopaminergic level coherently with the development and maintenance of MDMA self-administration in some experimental animals and the development of a substance misuse in some humans. More systematic investigation in humans should be assessed, focusing on interindividual variables in MDMA pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics to better understand its acute specific pharmacological effects and toxicity. Despite its misuse, there is a great enthusiasm from clinicians who see the potential role of MDMA as a powerful addition to psychotherapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as a potential primary treatment for social dysfunction occurring in a wide range of other neuropsychiatric disorders (social anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorders). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

This study aimed to analyze the prevalence, risk factors and relation to the acculturation of psychoactive substance abuse in adults living in North Cyprus (NC). Method: Data was collected from 1064 people who were living in NC using multiple stepped stratified random sampling method between April–May 2018. Socio-demographic information form, Model Europe Survey and Acculturation Attitudes Scale were used as study instruments. 2018 data were compared with 2003, 2008, 2013, 2015 and 2017 studies in which the same survey and method were used. Results: Five hundred and forty five participants were male and 519 female. Also, 33.6% of the participants were between the ages of 18–29, 58% of participants were born in Cyprus, 38.2% were university graduate or above and 48.2% of the participants were living with their spouses. According to the study, the prevalence of cigarette usage at least once in a lifetime was 64.9%, alcohol 74.5%, other psychoactive substance (OPS) 11.4% and illicit substance (IS) 9.0%. Being under 25 years of age, Turkey-born, not religious, using alcohol and cigarettes and experiencing drunkenness constituted the risk factors of IS users. Marginalization scores were lower both for drug users born in Turkey and NC. Discussion: It was observed that both OPS and IS usage have increased in the last 15 years. Cannabis, synthetic cannabinoid and ecstasy are more widely used. It was also observed that OPS is more used among those who cannot create a marginal response to acculturation stress. In prevention programs and treatments, sociocultural characteristics should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"

In a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew's disease, Parkinson's disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice."
"4243","0","A developmental approach to delineate components of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.^
Two developmentally based tests were devised to study the nature of schizophrenic cognitive dysfunction within a psychopharmacological framework and to relate the data to developmental and psychophysiological models. The Colour Form Preference Test was designed to evaluate cognitive style in terms of early maturational stages and provided a subscale for assessing arousal related cognitive disturbance. The Egocentricity of Thought Test, adapted from Piaget's developmental study of right-left positional concepts, enabled investigation in terms of the later stages of cognitive growth. These and other clinical measures were taken of schizophrenic patients at various points of treatment and also administered to a non psychotic comparison group. Test results supported their validity, reliability, longitudinal sensitivity and capacity for nosological and prognostic discriminations. The data also suggested a distinction between two components of schizophrenic cognitive dysfunction, viz. one drug sensitive, which could be considered as arousal related, and the other drug resistant, which might best be described as developmental. A two factor model encompassing the psychophysiological and developmental hypotheses is thus offered as a more comprehensive representation of the cognitive disorder."

Background: Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main intoxicating component of cannabis, can cause cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Whether this impairment is still present many hours or even days after THC use requires clarification. Possible ""next day"" effects are of major significance in safety-sensitive workplaces. We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the ""next day"" effects of THC. Methods: Studies that measured performance on safety-sensitive tasks (e.g., driving, flying) and/or neuropsychological tests >8 h after THC (or cannabis) use using interventional designs were identified by searching two online databases from inception until March 28, 2022. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the relevant Cochrane tools. Results were described in terms of whether THC had a significant effect on performance relative to the primary comparator (i.e., placebo or baseline, as appropriate). Results: Twenty studies (n=458) involving 345 performance tests were reviewed. Most studies administered a single dose of THC (median [interquartile range]: 16 [11-26] mg) and assessed performance between >12 and 24 h post-treatment. N=209/345 tests conducted across 16 published studies showed no ""next day"" effects of THC. Nine of these 16 studies used randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. Half (N=8) had ""some"" RoB, and half (N=8) had a ""high"" RoB. Notably, N=88 of these 209 tests failed to demonstrate ""acute"" (i.e., <8 h post-treatment) THC-induced impairment. N=12/345 tests conducted across five published studies indicated negative (i.e., impairing) ""next day"" effects of THC. None of these five studies used randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs and all were published >18 years ago (four, >30 years ago). Three had ""some"" RoB, and two had a ""high"" RoB. A further N=121/345 tests indicated ""unclear"" ""next day"" effects of THC with insufficient information provided to assess outcomes. The remaining N=3/345 tests indicated positive (i.e., enhancing) ""next day"" effects of THC. Conclusions: Some lower quality studies have reported ""next day"" effects of THC on cognitive function and safety-sensitive tasks. However, most studies, including some of higher quality, have found no such effect. Overall, it appears that there is limited scientific evidence to support the assertion that cannabis use impairs ""next day"" performance. Further studies involving improved methodologies are required to better address this issue."
"937","0","Analgesic potential of macrodoses and microdoses of classical psychedelics in chronic pain sufferers: a population survey.^
Although several studies and reports have shown the potential analgesic use of serotonergic psychedelics in cancer pain, phantom limb pain and cluster headache, evidence supporting their use for chronic pain is still limited. The past years have seen a considerable renewal of interest toward the therapeutic use of these compounds for mood disorders, resulting in a marked increase in the number of people turning to psychedelics in an attempt to self-medicate a health condition or improve their wellbeing. In western countries particularly, this population of users overlaps substantially with chronic pain sufferers, representing a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects these compounds have on pain and wellbeing. Here, we report results from an online survey conducted between August 2020 and July 2021 in a population of 250 chronic pain sufferers who had experience with psychedelics, either in microdoses (small sub-hallucinogenic doses), macrodoses (hallucinogenic doses), or both. Macrodoses, while less often used for analgesic purposes than microdoses, were reported to induce a higher level of pain relief than both microdoses and conventional pain medications (including opioids and cannabis). Although the effects were weaker and potentially more prone to expectation bias than with macrodoses, our results also suggested some benefits of psychedelics in microdoses for pain management. The reported analgesic effect appeared unrelated to mood improvements associated with psychedelic use, or the advocacy of psychedelic use. Taken together, our findings indicate interesting potential analgesic applications for psychedelics that warrant further clinical research."
"4463","0","Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy as a Potential Treatment for Eating Disorders: a Narrative Review of Preliminary Evidence.^
Eating disorders (ED) are a group of potentially severe mental disorders characterized by abnormal energy balance, cognitive dysfunction and emotional distress. Cognitive inflexibility is a major challenge to successful ED treatment and dysregulated serotonergic function has been implicated in this symptomatic dimension. Moreover, there are few effective treatment options and long-term remission of ED symptoms is difficult to achieve. There is emerging evidence for the use of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for a range of mental disorders. Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic which has demonstrated therapeutic benefit to a variety of psychiatric illnesses characterized by rigid thought patterns and treatment resistance. The current paper presents a narrative review of the hypothesis that psilocybin may be an effective adjunctive treatment for individuals with EDs, based on biological plausibility, transdiagnostic evidence and preliminary results. Limitations of the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy model and proposed future directions for the application to eating behavior are also discussed. Although the literature to date is not sufficient to propose the incorporation of psilocybin in the treatment of disordered eating behaviors, preliminary evidence supports the need for more rigorous clinical trials as an important avenue for future investigation."
"2208","1","Psilocybin Induces Aberrant Prediction Error Processing of Tactile Mismatch Responses - A Simultaneous EEG-FMRI Study.^
As source of sensory information, the body provides a sense of agency and self/non-self-discrimination. The integration of bodily states and sensory inputs with prior beliefs has been linked to the generation of bodily self-consciousness. The ability to detect surprising tactile stimuli is essential for the survival of an organism and for the formation of mental body representations. Despite the relevance for a variety of psychiatric disorders characterized by altered body and self-perception, the neurobiology of these processes is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effect of psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self-experience, on tactile mismatch responses by combining pharmacological manipulations with simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recording. Psi reduced activity in response to tactile surprising stimuli in frontal regions, the visual cortex, and the cerebellum. Furthermore, Psi reduced tactile mismatch negativity EEG responses at frontal electrodes, associated with alterations of body- and self-experience. This study provides first evidence that Psi alters the integration of tactile sensory inputs through aberrant prediction error processing and highlights the importance of the 5-HT2A system in tactile deviancy processing as well as in the integration of bodily and self-related stimuli. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant bodily self-awareness."
"3406","1","Psychedelic Microdosing, Mindfulness, and Anxiety: A Cross-Sectional Mediation Study.^
While anecdotal reports claim that psychedelic microdosing reduces anxiety and mood symptoms, evidence supporting these claims is scarce. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between microdosing and trait anxiety. Furthermore, it was investigated if trait mindfulness mediated this association. Participants completed anonymous online questionnaires and were divided into three groups: current microdosers (n = 186), former microdosers (n = 77) and microdosing-naïve controls (n = 234). Trait anxiety and trait mindfulness were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory–Trait subscale (STAI-T) and the 15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15) respectively. Current and former microdosers reported lower STAI-T scores compared to microdosing-naïve controls. Furthermore, associations of current and former microdosing with trait anxiety were mediated by trait mindfulness, with small effects of FFMQ-15 Total, Non-judging and Non-reactivity scores. However, in an exploratory analysis, all associations between microdosing and STAI-T scores became non-significant when participants with previous macrodose experience (n = 386) were excluded. Our findings suggest that RCT<apos;>s are warranted to test causal hypotheses concerning the effects of microdosing and the role of trait mindfulness in the effects of microdosing, while controlling for previous macrodose experience."
"4996","0","Subjective effects in humans following administration of party pill drugs BZP and TFMPP alone and in combination.^
The use of piperazine derivatives, colloquially named 'party pills', has been escalating in New Zealand and worldwide since their introduction in the 1990s. Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is often used alone, or can be combined with trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). Taken together as an oral dose, they have been reported to produce effects similar to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). While the pharmacokinetic data have recently been published, little research has been conducted on the subjective effects of these piperazines on humans. This paper outlines the subjective effects observed following oral doses of BZP (200 mg) and TFMPP (60 mg) alone, or in combination (100/30 mg) compared to placebo. Participants were asked to comment on the subjective effects of each drug using three subjective rating scales-the Addiction Center Research Inventory (ARCI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Visual Analog Scales (VAS)-before and approximately 120 min after a single dose. BZP showed significant dexamphetamine-like stimulant effects, inducing euphoria, sociability, and drug liking, whereas TFMPP induced fewer stimulant-like effects and increased anxiety, via its serotonergic effects. The combination of BZP and TFMPP induced similar subjective effects, along with well-characterized dexamphetamine- and MDMA-like effects. These subjective data allow for obvious comparisons to be made between party pill drugs and other commonly known stimulants. However, despite estimates of over 20 million doses sold in New Zealand alone and increasing seizures by the Drug Enforcement Administration in the USA, there are no published cases of dependence worldwide. The long-term effects of regular party pill use are also unknown, and create the potential for future research."
"9274","0","Development of a rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of amphetamines in human plasma and oral fluid by LC-MS-MS.^
Target analysis of amphetamines in biological samples is of great importance for clinical and forensic toxicologists alike. At present, most laboratories analyze such samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, this procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly as a preliminary extraction and derivatization are usually unavoidable. Here we describe the development of an alternative method. Amphetamines were isolated from human plasma and oral fluid using a simple methanol precipitation step and subsequently analyzed using reversed-phase liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. Quantitation of the drugs was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The developed method, which requires only 50 μL of biological sample, has a total analysis time of less than 20 min (including sample preparation) and enables the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ephedrine in a single chromatographic run. Limits of detection of 2 μg/L or better were obtained. The method has been validated and subsequently applied to the analysis of plasma and oral fluid samples collected from current drug users."
"5804","1","Greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine in males.^
RATIONALE: Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function."
"4084","1","Active mechanisms of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy: A systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and substance use disorders (SUD). METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of KAP and discussing mechanisms of action, identified on PubMed and PsycInfo. RESULTS: Five randomized-controlled trials reported on the efficacy of KAP treatment and discussed active mechanisms. Four of the studies treated adults with SUD and a single study treated adults with TRD. Overall, KAP had a significant positive effect on primary outcome measures compared to controls, however, the data is mixed. The study examining KAP for TRD found no benefit. LIMITATIONS: Lack of large, replicated clinical trials. No studies actively examining mechanisms of action. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that temporary neural changes caused by ketamine such as n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition and increase of synaptic neuroplasticity affect treatment outcomes of KAP. Based on reports of preliminary findings, we speculate that adjunct psychotherapy, changes in perspective, and spirituality may also play a role."
"3682","1","Pharmacological-assisted Psychotherapy for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder: a systematic review and meta-analysis.^
Background: Pharmacological-assisted psychotherapies, using conventional and novel drug agents, are increasingly being used both in clinical and experimental research settings, respectively. Objective: To determine the efficacy of conventional and novel pharmacological-assisted psychotherapies in reducing PTSD symptom severity. Method: A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised-controlled trials were undertaken; 21 studies were included. Results: MDMA-assisted therapy was found to statistically superior to active and inactive placebo-assisted therapy in reduction of PTSD symptoms (standardised mean difference -1.09, 95% CI -1.60 to -0.58). There was no evidence of superiority over placebo for any other intervention. Conclusions: MDMA-assisted therapy demonstrated an impressive effect size; however, it is difficult to have confidence at this stage in this intervention due to the small numbers of participants included, and more research in this area is needed. There was no evidence to support the efficacy of any other drug-assisted interventions."

A gas chromatography-mass spectrometric (GC-MS) method was developed and validated for the determination of five psychotropic phenylalkylamine derivatives (amphetamine, AP; methamphetamine, MA; 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, MDA; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA; norketamine, NKT) in human hair. Hair samples (10 mg) were washed with distilled water and acetone, mechanically pulverized for 1.5 min with a bead mill, and then incubated in 1 mL of methanol under ultrasonication at 50 °C for 1 h. The resulting solutions were evaporated to dryness, derivatized using heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA) at 50 °C for 30 min, and analyzed by GC-MS. The linear ranges were 0.1-20.0 ng/mg for AP and MA and 0.05-20.0 ng/mg for MDA, MDMA, and NKT, with the coefficients of determination (r2 > 0.9982). The intra-day and inter-day precisions were within 11.5% and 12.8%, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day accuracies were -4.1% to 5.8% and -6.6% to 4.2%, respectively. The limits of detections (LODs) for each compound were lower than 0.028 ng/mg. The recoveries were in the range of 78.9-101.2%. Based on these results, the method proved to be effective for the rapid and simple determination of phenylalkylamine derivatives in hair specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"3009","0","Predictors of outcomes in drug abuse treatment - A prospective study about 257 patients of the Cassini center in Paris.^
Assessing the effectiveness of treatment is one of the main conceens of any medical process. The different ways proposed for assuming the responsibility of drug addicts and their efficacy are greatly heterogeneous since drug-abusing takes on diverse forms. Thus, in order to closely target the request of drug addicts and adjust their follow-up, we undertook to study prospectively, for 3 months, a population of drug addicts taking medical advice for the first time at the Cassini center in Paris, with the assumption that some predictors may forecast outcomes. Method : Data were obtained at the admission with a structured interview about socio-economic and demographic status, psychiatric disorders (assessed clinically according to DSM III-R and with HAD and MADRS scales), substance use and prior treatment history, environmental data (as well as familial substance use or support lending). Medical and paramedical referents have been interviewed after their first contact with the patient about his expectations and his motivation. Familial attendance at this first contact was noted as well as its implication in the programm. At the end of the study, we noted length of stay, regularity of follow up and clinical changes with a last interview of the staff. Results : Half the time, patients' follow up doesn't last a month, drug abuse doesn't change in 6 out of 10 cases, and we only note 14% of durable abstinence. Polydrug abuse (over 80%) is not linked, here, with pejorative outcomes, in opposition to the usual literature. Heroin is the main substance used by our population (over 80%), other opiates, sedatives and alcohol are associated by more than 30% of these patients ; cocain is associated in a quarter of the cases. More than 10% of the patients are concerned by ecstasy and LSD. Cannabis use is common. Medical complaint (mainly viral diseases) at the begining, of the programm, concerns one of two patients. Only a few are initialy known as being HIV positive, suggesting a great lack of information. Over forty percent of the patients are given a DSM III-R diagnosis at the end of the first medical advice, when a doubt subsists for a third of the other patients. Major depressive disorder for the first axis and borderline personality disorder for the second axis are the main disorders we founded. We also noted a large ratio (n = 13, 5%) of schizophrenic disorders. Univariate analysis: Length and regularity of the programms are key factors of their efficacy. A long follow-up is also required to improve patients' socio-economical status. Initial psychiatric disorders are linked, in our study as well as in literature, with longer stays in therapeutic programms. By revenge, psychiatric disorders at the third month (over 10%) are linked with poorer outcomes. We noted with interest that, in our sample, neither imprisonment in the past (over 40%, but we noted several imprisonments in a case out of two), or intraveinous route at any moment of the patient's life time (40%), or else a programm caused by a court (a quarter of the patients) are of wrong prognosis. Relatives' implication in the programm is linked with favorable outcomes. Multivariate analysis draws 3 independant clusters about the length of stay. One concerns patient's motivation as assessed by medical staff. An other one concerns patient's relatives' implication in the care. A third one is about the begining of the treatment: an initial medical prescrition and a psychological help are linked with favorable outcomes. About the efficacy, multivariate analysis isolates 4 independant clusters. Prior drug abuse programms (one out of three patients) are associated with poorer outcomes, when, by revenge, familial relationship initialy seen by the patient as (very) satisfaying, patient's motivation, and, again, an initial medical prescription are linked with better outcomes. The study of those of the patients whose programm lasted more then 3 months but without any appreciable benefit shows that a long follow-up is successfull when iris regular, when it provides a socio-economical status improvement and when the patient is given access to insight. For these patients, the (old) age is associated with better outcomes. By revenge, such a 3 months follow-up is not able to reduce drug abuse when a psychiatric disorder exists at the third month. Patients whose treatment was refered by a court don't differ from the others: their length of stay and outcomes are the same. Discussion: Our study confirms our initial hypothesis according to witch subgroups in our population of drug abusers should be isolated and that some predictors of outcomes should be described. Three points seem important to be discussed. First, a medical presciption appears to be important to initiate the relationship between the patient and his practicioner. We have never see any report about this particular point. Second, our study proves the importance of the patient's relatives' implication in the programm. Finaly, a programm ordered by a court is not pejorative per se. According to the literature, the other results we obtained corroborate some factors detected by other studies, and emphasize the priority of subjective contingents, especially psychopathological ones, over socio-demographical elements. The main limit of this study holds in the fact that our sample only concerns 78% of the population we could include in the study, according to the well known difficulties of such studies. It should be of interest to complete this study, especially to confirm these predictors on a longer term, in other centers and cities. Conclusion: According to the literature, this study accounts for the necessary global and sustained work with drug abusers. We have to answer to these patients' multiple requests, that don't just concern drug abuse, but also (and sometimes merely) psychiatric suffering, social isolation, or medical disease."
"8098","0","Neural mechanisms underlying psilocybin's therapeutic potential - the need for preclinical in vivo electrophysiology.^
Psilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound with profound perception-, emotion- and cognition-altering properties and great potential for treating brain disorders. However, the neural mechanisms mediating its effects require in-depth investigation as there is still much to learn about how psychedelic drugs produce their profound and long-lasting effects. In this review, we outline the current understanding of the neurophysiology of psilocybin's psychoactive properties, highlighting the need for additional preclinical studies to determine its effect on neural network dynamics. We first describe how psilocybin's effect on brain regions associated with the default-mode network (DMN), particularly the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, likely plays a key role in mediating its consciousness-altering properties. We then outline the specific receptor and cell types involved and discuss contradictory evidence from neuroimaging studies regarding psilocybin's net effect on activity within these regions. We go on to argue that in vivo electrophysiology is ideally suited to provide a more holistic, neural network analysis approach to understand psilocybin's mode of action. Thus, we integrate information about the neural bases for oscillatory activity generation with the accumulating evidence about psychedelic drug effects on neural synchrony within DMN-associated areas. This approach will help to generate important questions for future preclinical and clinical studies. Answers to these questions are vital for determining the neural mechanisms mediating psilocybin's psychotherapeutic potential, which promises to improve outcomes for patients with severe depression and other difficulty to treat conditions."

The main aim of the study is to investigate the possible long‐term therapeutic effects of psilocybin on the symptoms of severe depression, as well as the brain mechanisms underlying these changes. Depression severity is assessed before and after (i.e., 1 week, 3 months and 6 months after) a single dose of psilocybin and compared to respective scores of a group receiving an active placebo, ketamine. Brain activity (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) is measured before and one week after drug administration in order to determine whether changes in brain networks related to emotional and self‐referential processing correlate with any observed changes in depression scores. Further, blood samples will be obtained from the participants and analyzed in order to reveal gene expression and molecular level correlates underlying rapid antidepressant effects, and to identify biomarkers that predict treatment outcome."

Depression is the most common psychological disease in our society, significantly impeding the quality of life of patients and their relatives. Since available antidepressants take multiple weeks to provide full mood-enhancing activities and often show only insufficient efficacy, current research investigates new drug classes with different modes of action to accelerate antidepressant efficiency particularly for suicidal emergencies and to overcome the therapeutic gap that exists for therapy resistance in the treatment of depression. In this context, psychedelics are in the focus of current clinical investigations because of their quick onset of action and promising efficacy in treatment of resistant depression. Simultaneously, further applications are discussed, e. g. adjunct treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The already approved esketamine as well as the hallucinogenic psilocybin, which is under experimental clinical investigation, are promising psychedelic drugs for the treatment of acute and therapy resistant major depression. Enhanced neurotrophin release and activity thereby enhancing neuronal plasticity that seems to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of action of these substances. Apart from ketamine and psilocybin there are also clinical trials on cannabis, LSD and MDMA for treatment of various psychiatric diseases, including major depression."
"2659","0","The concept and management of acute episodes of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.^
BACKGROUND: The definitions of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (TRBD) have varied across studies. Additionally, its management is clinically challenging. An updated synthesis and appraisal of the available evidence is needed. METHODS: A systematic search of major electronic databases from inception up to May 25th, 2020, was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the management of TRBD. When sufficient evidence was available, a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (n = 928 patients) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Fourteen studies (n = 803) assessed treatment-resistant acute bipolar depression (TRBD-De), including five neuromodulatory and nine pharmacological trials. Rapid- vs. standard up-titration of clozapine showed promising efficacy for TRBD mania, without significant adverse events. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was confirmed to be similarly effective for TRBD-De as for treatment-resistant unipolar depression: odd ratio, OR = 0.919 (95%C.I. = 0.44-1.917), I(2) = 13.98, p = .822. TRBD-De patients exposed to ketamine at day one post-infusion had high odds of response: OR = 10.682 (95%C.I. = 2.142-53.272), I(2) = 0, p = <.005. The pooled drop-out rate in the ketamine trials was 21.2%. Additional evidence is warranted to confirm the potential efficacy of pramipexole or stimulants for TRBD-De. LIMITATIONS: Publication/measurement bias; exploratory nature of the meta-analyses for interventions that included participants solely with TRBD-De. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a few interventions are available for TRBD, including pramipexole, ECT, and clozapine, among others. Larger and better-designed trials for TRBD are warranted and should be based on more uniform operational definitions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018114567."
"1239","1","Esketamine Nasal Spray for the Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder With Acute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior.^
PURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Numerous health authority approvals of esketamine nasal spray, combined with oral antidepressant, to treat depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder and acute suicidal ideation or behavior were based on 2 identically designed, double-blind, phase 3 studies. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Across both ASPIRE studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133), patients (N = 456) were randomized to esketamine 84 mg or placebo nasal spray twice weekly for 4 weeks plus comprehensive standard of care, including hospitalization and newly initiated or optimized antidepressant(s). In post hoc analyses of pooled data, changes from baseline at 24 hours after the first dose in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised, in the full cohort and in subgroups, were analyzed using analysis of covariance. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Esketamine plus standard of care demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score versus placebo plus standard of care at 24 hours (least square mean difference [95% confidence interval], -3.8 [-5.75 to -1.89]) and at earlier (4 hours: -3.4 [-5.05 to -1.71]) and later time points (day 25: -3.4 [-5.36 to -1.36]). The between-group difference (95% confidence interval) for change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised at 24 hours was -0.20 (-0.43 to 0.04) for all patients and -0.31 (-0.61 to -0.01) for those with a history of suicide attempt. Common adverse events (≥20%) during esketamine treatment were dizziness, dissociation, nausea, somnolence, and headache. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine plus comprehensive standard of care rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have acute suicidal ideation or behavior, especially in those with a history of suicide attempt, providing a new treatment option for this particularly ill and vulnerable population."
"4030","1","A randomised study of intranasal dexmedetomidine and oral ketamine for premedication in children.^
We studied the effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with oral ketamine for premedication in children. One hundred and sixty children aged between 2 and 6 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 1); 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 2); 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 3); and 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 4). Sedation levels 10, 20 and 30 min after premedication were evaluated using a 5-point sedation scale. A 4-point emotional state score was used to evaluate patients when they were separated from their parents and their response to intravenous cannulation or facemask application. Approximately 90% of patients readily accepted premedication and onset times of acceptable sedation were similar in all four groups. Patients in Group 4 were significantly more sedated than those in Group 1 after 30 min (p = 0.036). A significantly higher proportion of patients in Group 3 (84%) and Group 4 (87%) accepted intravenous cannulation compared with those in Group 1 (40%) and Group 2 (54%) (p = 0.001). We conclude that the administration of 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine and 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine was the optimal combination, with children being easily separated from their parent, accepting intravenous cannulation and without causing excessive side-effects or postoperative complications."

QUESTIONS UNDER STUDY / PRINCIPLES: The main aim of this study was to investigate profiles of drug users, with a particular focus on illicit drugs other than cannabis, and to explore the effect of early-onset intensive use (drunkenness, daily smoking, high on cannabis) on profiles of illicit drug use. METHODS: Baseline data from a representative sample of 5,831 young Swiss men in the ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors were used. Substance use (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and 15 types of other illicit drug) and age of onset of intensive use were assessed. The Item Response Theory (IRT) and prevalence rates at different ages of onset were used to reveal different profiles of illicit drug use. RESULTS: In addition to cannabis, there were two profiles of other illicit drug use: (a) ""softer"" drug users (uppers, hallucinogens and inhaled drugs), among which ecstasy had the highest discriminatory potential (IRT slope = 4.68, standard error (SE) = 0.48; p <0.001); and (b) ""harder"" drug users (heroin, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate/gamma- hydroxylactone, research chemicals, crystal meth and spice), among which ketamine had the highest discriminatory potential (slope = 4.05; SE = 0.63; p <0.001). Onset of intensive use at the age of 12 years or younger also discriminated between these two profiles. CONCLUSION: Both the IRT model and the effect of onset of intensive use enabled two groups of illicit drugs to be identified. In particular, very early onset (at 12 years or younger) intensive use of any substance was a marker for later use of the second group of drugs."
"993","0","Ayahuasca and the treatment of drug addiction.^
The public health impact of addiction, with its high relapse rates and the limited efficacy of available treatments, has prompted the search for alternative therapeutic approaches. In recent times, there has been renewed interest in the anti-addictive potential of psychedelics. Consumption of ayahuasca, the N,Ndimethyltryptamine- containing Amazonian plant tea, is experiencing unprecedented expansion. The ritual use of this brew, obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, in shamanistic and religious contexts is now popular in Europe and North America. Studies of long-term ayahuasca-church members in Brazil have recorded discontinuation of drug use after starting ayahuasca use. Furthermore, several centers that offer therapies based on ayahuasca as a means to treat addictive behavior claim higher success rates than more traditional approaches. In this chapter, we review the pharmacology of ayahuasca and the data available concerning its efficacy in the treatment of drug addiction. Although the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, based on the evidence examined, is promising, the lack of systematic studies precludes firm conclusions. Ideally, research methodology should be improved, with future studies implementing well-planned clinical protocols with adequate controls, end-points, and follow-up. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

"5538","0","Pharmacokinetic profile of single and repeated oral doses of MDMA in squirrel monkeys: Relationship to lasting effects on brain serotonin neurons.^
A large body of data indicates that (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA, 'ecstasy') can damage brain serotonin neurons in animals. However, the relevance of these preclinical data to humans is uncertain, because doses and routes of administration used in animals have generally differed from those used by humans. Here, we examined the pharmacokinetic profile of MDMA in squirrel monkeys after different routes of administration, and explored the relationship between acute plasma MDMA concentrations after repeated oral dosing and subsequent brain serotonin deficits. Oral MDMA administration engendered a plasma profile of MDMA in squirrel monkeys resembling that seen in humans, although the half-life of MDMA in monkeys is shorter ( 3 vs 6 - 9 h). MDMA was biotransformed into MDA, and the plasma ratio of MDA to MDMA was 3 - 5/100, similar to that in humans. MDMA accumulation in squirrel monkeys was nonlinear, and plasma levels were highly correlated with regional brain serotonin deficits observed 2 weeks later. The present results indicate that plasma concentrations of MDMA shown here to produce lasting serotonergic deficits in squirrel monkeys overlap those reported by other laboratories in some recreational 'ecstasy' consumers, and are two to three times higher than those found in humans administered a single 100 - 150 mg dose of MDMA in a controlled setting. Additional studies are needed on the relative sensitivity of brain serotonin neurons to MDMA toxicity in humans and non-human primates, the pharmacokinetic parameter(s) of MDMA most closely linked to the neurotoxic process, and metabolites other than MDA that may play a role."
"2549","0","Breakthrough for Trauma Treatment: Safety and Efficacy of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy Compared to Paroxetine and Sertraline.^
Unsuccessfully treated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and life-threatening disorder. Two medications, paroxetine hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride, are approved treatments for PTSD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Analyses of pharmacotherapies for PTSD found only small to moderate effects when compared with placebo. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the FDA for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD on the basis of pooled analyses showing a large effect size for this treatment. This review covers data supporting BTD. In this treatment, MDMA is administered with psychotherapy in up to three monthly 8-h sessions. Participants are prepared for these sessions beforehand, and process material arising from the sessions in follow-up integrative psychotherapy sessions. Comparing data used for the approval of paroxetine and sertraline and pooled data from Phase 2 studies, MAPS demonstrated that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy constitutes a substantial improvement over available pharmacotherapies in terms of safety and efficacy. Studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy had lower dropout rates compared to sertraline and paroxetine trials. As MDMA is only administered under direct observation during a limited number of sessions, there is little chance of diversion, accidental or intentional overdose, or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. BTD status has expedited the development of MAPS phase 3 trials occurring worldwide, leading up to a planned submission seeking FDA approval in 2021.

Salvinorin A is a kappa opioid agonist and the principal psychoactive constituent of the Salvia divinorum plant, which has been used for hallucinogenic effects. Previous research on salvinorin A pharmacokinetics likely underestimated plasma levels typically resulting from the doses administered due to inefficient vaporization and not collecting samples during peak drug effects. Six healthy adults inhaled a single high dose of vaporized salvinorin A (n = 4, 21 mcg/kg; n = 2, 18 mcg/kg). Participant- and monitor-rated effects were assessed every 2 min for 60 min post-inhalation. Blood samples were collected at 13 time points up to 90 min post-inhalation. Drug levels peaked at 2 min and then rapidly decreased. Drug levels were significantly, positively correlated with participant and monitor drug effect ratings. Significant elevations in prolactin were observed beginning 5 min post-inhalation and peaking at 15 min post-inhalation. Cortisol showed inconsistent increases across participants. Hormonal responses were not well correlated with drug levels. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct relationship between changes in plasma levels of salvinorin A and drug effects in humans. The results confirm the efficacy of an inhalation technique for salvinorin A."
"3111","1","Ketamine as a mental health treatment: Are acute psychoactive effects associated with outcomes? A systematic review.^
Esketamine was recently licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Drug Agency (EDA) for use in treatment resistant depression (TRD), and further research indicates ketamine as a possible treatment in other mental health conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesised that ketamine's acute psychoactive effects may be associated with psychiatric treatment efficacy. We systematically reviewed the evidence for this association. The databases Medline, Embase and Psychlnfo were searched up to June 2019. Studies were included if they enrolled adults with a psychiatric diagnosis, assessed acute psychoactive effects using a quantitative measure, and reported on the relationship between acute effects and treatment outcome. We included 21 studies, involving 891 patients. Seventeen studies assessed patients with depression (TRD [k = 14]), three assessed substance use disorders, and one assessed social anxiety disorder. Overall, 41 associations were assessed, of which 26 % were significant. The studies reviewed displayed great variability in terms of methodology and quality of reporting. The most commonly assessed effect was dissociation, measured by the CADSS. Our results suggest that the CADSS total is not consistently associated with antidepressant outcomes. Apart from this, the current literature is too limited to draw definite conclusions on the presence of an association between acute psychoactive effects and mental health outcomes. The field would benefit from consistently employing a priori hypotheses, more transparent reporting and sufficiently powered statistical analyses. Furthermore, the use of a broader range of assessments tools of acute psychoactive effects during ketamine administration would be beneficial."
"6212","1","Clinical Predictors of Intravenous Ketamine Response in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^
Study Design: This will be a randomized, double‐blinded, midazolam‐controlled crossover trial. There is no perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent for participation, the day before infusion (Day ‐1), participants will complete a set of rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID; 30μg/kg over 40 minutes). We will randomize infusion sequences in a 1‐to‐1 ratio: KET followed by MID (K→M) or vice versa (M→K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and Day 21, separated by a 20‐day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. We will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Days ‐1, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41. Patients will provide daily self‐ratings of depressive symptoms (using the quick inventory of depressive symptoms 16‐item self‐rated version; QIDS 16‐SR). Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following the second infusion. Study Groups: Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30μg/kg of MID diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter reduces the response to ketamine."
"1777","0","Acute effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression.^
OBJECTIVE: The incidence rate of major depression in adolescents reaches approximately 14%. This disorder is usually recurrent, without remission of symptoms even after pharmacological treatment, and persists throughout adult life. Since the effects of antidepressants take approximately 2 weeks to begin, new pharmacological therapies are under continuous exploration. Recent evidence suggests that psychedelics could produce rapid antidepressant effects. In this study, we evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression. METHODS: While living with their families, juvenile marmosets (8 males; 7 females) were observed on alternate days for four weeks during a baseline phase. This was followed by 8 weeks of an induced depressive state protocol, the social isolated context (IC), in which the animals were monitored in the first and last weeks. Subsequently, five males and four females were randomly selected for treatment, first with a single administration of saline vehicle (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage), followed by a single dose of ayahuasca (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage). Both phases lasted 1 week and the animals were monitored daily. A third week of sampling was called the tardive-pharmacological effects phase. In all phases the marmosets were assessed for behavior, fecal cortisol levels, and body weight. RESULTS: After IC, the animals presented typical hypocortisolemia, but cortisol recovered to baseline levels 24 h after an acute dose of ayahuasca; this recovery was not observed in vehicle-treated animals. Additionally, in males, ayahuasca, but not the vehicle, reduced scratching, a stereotypic behavior, and increased feeding. Ayahuasca treatment also improved body weight to baseline levels in both sexes. The ayahuasca-induced behavioral response had long-term effects (14 days). Thus, in this translational juvenile animal model of depression, ayahuasca presented beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results can contribute to the validation of ayahuasca as an antidepressant drug and encourage new studies on psychedelic drugs as a tool for treating mood disorders, including for adolescents with early-onset depression."
"4644","1","Memory and mood during the night and in the morning after repeated evening doses of MDMA.^
Previously it has been shown that MDMA causes memory impairment during daytime testing. However, MDMA is usually taken in the evening or during the night. In addition, it is known that sleep deprivation also causes memory impairment. The present study aimed to assess whether evening doses of MDMA added to, or interacted with the memory impairment due to sleep deprivation. Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 75 and 50 mg divided over the evening or double placebo. Memory tests and subjective measures of mood were conducted at baseline and three times post dosing that is at 6.30 pm, 9.30 pm, 1.30 am and 7 am, respectively -1.5, 1.5, 5.5 and 11 h relative to drug intake (first dose). Memory performance detoriated progessively over time as a function of sleep loss, independent of treatment. MDMA added to this impairment as indicated by a significant main effect of MDMA on verbal and spatial memory performance. Mood ratings and response speed revealed an MDMA by Time interaction. After administration of MDMA response speed improved and feelings of vigor, friendliness, elation, anxiety, confusion, arousal and positive mood increased in magnitude during the night, while all these parameters returned to placebo-like levels on the final morning session. It is concluded that evening doses of MDMA selectively impair memory performance, and that this impairment is additional to the effect of sleep deprivation on memory performance."
"5403","0","Glutamate modulators as novel interventions for mood disorders.^
Recent evidence suggests that critical molecules in neurotrophic signaling cascades are long-term targets for currently available monoaminergic antidepressants. As chronic and severe mood disorders are characterized by impairments in neuronal resilience, pharmacological strategies that subserve a neuroprotective function might alter disorder pathophysiology and modify disease progression. Several promising approaches involve modulation of the glutamate neurotransmitter system, via post-synaptic receptor blockade or potentiation and presynaptic vesicular release inhibition. A focused review of the extant scientific literature was conducted, with a discussion of 3 compounds or classes of drugs currently undergoing clinical investigation: ketamine, riluzole, and AMPA receptor potentiators. Recent investigations in mood disordered patients suggest that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine might demonstrate rapid antidepressant properties. Riluzole has been shown to reverse glutamate-mediated impairments in neuronal plasticity and to stimulate the synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor. Open-label trials in treatment-resistant depression have yielded promising results. Likewise, AMPA receptor potentiators favorably impact neurotrophic factors as well as enhance cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological approaches that modulate components of the glutamate system offer novel targets for severe, recurrent mood disorders. Controlled studies are necessary."

About 40% of the people with the obsessive-compulsive-disorder do not experience the desired outcome after the existing treatment, and its several side effects were reported. This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of alternative drugs and assess the possibility of their use as treatment options for obsessive-compulsive-disorder. The Scientific databases PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Directory of Open Access Journals, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, were searched from inception to March 2022, using appropriate search strategies for each drug and following the Prisma guidelines 2020. Studies were selected according to the already set criteria and assessed for bias. Data were extracted, and descriptive and continuous data were analyzed and presented as frequency/percentage and mean. A total of 16 observational and interventional studies were included for data extraction. The studies focused on four drugs, Psilocybin (n=4), Cannabis (n=7), Nicotine (n=3), and Morphine (n=2), that were used to test out their effect on OCD symptoms. Overall, the majority of the studies showed promising results by documenting a reduction in Y-BOCS scores. However, few subjects, specifically those using nicotine or Cannabis, did not affect their condition or self-reported worsening symptoms. Few side effects were also noticed. This systematic review found that the drugs mostly showed a positive response. All Psilocybin and morphine users, 88.2% and 74.1% of the nicotine and Cannabis users, respectively, reported experiencing the positive effect of these drugs, indicating that these drugs have the potential to be used in the management of OCD. However, further research is required in this arena to thoroughly understand the mechanism of action by which these drugs produce their therapeutic effect. Policies to destigmatize and encourage clinical trials with these drugs are crucial for exploring the use of these drugs as a treatment option for OCD."
"5105","0","Psychedelic Experiences After Bereavement Improve Symptoms of Grief: The Influence of Emotional Breakthroughs and Challenging Experiences.^
Grief, a common reaction to loss, can frequently become problematic or impairing. Available treatments for prolonged grief disorder are promising but leave room for considerable improvement. Qualitative accounts of psychedelic experiences after bereavement reveal themes that parallel core components of prolonged grief disorder therapy. However, few studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for symptoms of grief. The present study surveyed recreational psychedelic users (N = 363) who had suffered a bereavement event. They reported retrospective grief symptoms before and after the psychedelic experience as well as subjective reactions to the psychedelic, including emotional breakthroughs and challenging experiences. Results indicate improvements in grief symptoms after a psychedelic experience, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.83). The occurrence of emotional breakthroughs was positively associated with improvements in symptoms of grief, while the converse relation was observed for challenging experiences. Findings provide preliminary evidence that support the development of a psychedelic-assisted therapy protocol to target symptoms of grief. Psychedelic-assisted therapy might offer an alternative to current grief treatment options."
"5381","1","Psilocybin induces acute and persisting alterations in immune status in healthy volunteers: An experimental, placebo-controlled study.^
Patients characterized by stress-related disorders such as depression display elevated circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a hyperactive HPA axis. Psychedelics are demonstrating promising results in treatment of such disorders, however the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects are still unknown. To date the evidence of acute and persisting effects of psychedelics on immune functioning, HPA axis activity in response to stress, and associated psychological outcomes is preliminary. To address this, we conducted a placebo-controlled, parallel group design comprising of 60 healthy participants who received either placebo (n = 30) or 0.17 mg/kg psilocybin (n = 30). Blood samples were taken to assess acute and persisting (7 day) changes in immune status. Seven days' post-administration, participants in each treatment group were further subdivided: 15 underwent a stress induction protocol, and 15 underwent a control protocol. Ultra-high field (7-Tesla) magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess whether acute changes in glutamate or glial activity were associated with changes in immune functioning. Finally, questionnaires assessed persisting self-report changes in mood and social behavior. Psilocybin immediately reduced concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), while other inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)- 1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)) remained unchanged. Seven days later, TNF-α concentrations returned to baseline, while IL-6 and CRP concentrations were persistently reduced in the psilocybin group. Changes in the immune profile were related to acute neurometabolic activity as acute reductions in TNF-α were linked to lower concentrations of glutamate in the hippocampus. Additionally, the more of a reduction in IL-6 and CRP seven days after psilocybin, the more persisting positive mood and social effects participants reported. Regarding the stress response, after a psychosocial stressor, psilocybin did not significantly alter the stress response. Results are discussed in regards to the psychological and therapeutic effects of psilocybin demonstrated in ongoing patient trials."

Patients who agree to participate in this study will be enrolled within 24 hours of being admitted to the UMMC inpatient psychiatric service with suicidal ideations. After a member of the study team ensures that the patient understands the risks and benefits of participating versus not participating, the patient will be assigned, by chance, to one of the following groups: ‐ Group A: receives ketamine intravenous (IV) infusion over 45 minutes ‐ Group B: receives saline (salt solution) over 45 minutes The infusion will be administered in either the Post‐Anesthesia Care Unit (PACU) or Short Stay Procedure Area (SSPA). After receiving the infusion, the patient will be monitored for an additional 30 minutes by medical personnel in either the PACU or SSPA. This study will be a randomized, double blind cohort study, so neither the patient nor the study doctor will know which infusion is being administered. While receiving the infusion, the patient's vital signs (including heart rate, heart rhythm, blood pressure, respiratory rate, and temperature) will be monitored on an anesthesia paper chart. After the patient is discharged from the hospital, the treatment team will analyze the patient's medical record and compare the length of hospital stay between the control and treatment groups. The only information about the patient's hospital stay that will be analyzed will be the length of hospital stay. If a patient is a woman of childbearing age, a urine pregnancy test will be performed after you agree to enroll in the study. The cost of this test will be covered by the University of Mississippi Departments of Anesthesiology and Psychiatry. If you are found to be pregnant, you will not be able to participate in the study. Patients admitted after suicidal attempt may be enrolled in the study. Those who attempted suicide by medication overdose may participate in the study, but must be cleared by a medical toxicology specialist prior to enrollment. Due to cardiovascular adverse effects of ketamine, all participants will receive a 12‐lead EKG to screen for cardiac arrhythmias. Any rhythm other than sinus rhythm will result in exclusion from the study. The patient's length of hospital stay will be recorded. Patients will be called at three and six months post‐discharge to assess for any adverse events or medication reactions. Readmission rates will be assessed at six months post‐discharge."

The profound economic burden of schizophrenia is due, in part, to the negative symptoms of the disease, which can severely limit daily functioning. There is much debate in the field regarding their measurement and classification and there are no FDA-approved treatments for negative symptoms despite an abundance of research. 3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) is a schedule I substance that has emerged as a novel therapeutic given its ability to enhance social interactions, generate empathy, and induce a state of metaplasticity in the brain. This review provides a rationale for the use of MDMA in the treatment of negative symptoms by reviewing the literature on negative symptoms, their treatment, MDMA, and MDMA-assisted therapy. It reviews recent evidence that supports the safe and potentially effective use of MDMA to treat negative symptoms and concludes with considerations regarding safety and possible mechanisms of action."
"8838","0","Effect of intermittent exposure to ethanol and MDMA during adolescence on learning and memory in adult mice.^
Background: Heavy binge drinking is increasingly frequent among adolescents, and consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is often combined with ethanol (EtOH). The long-lasting effects of intermittent exposure to EtOH and MDMA during adolescence on learning and memory were evaluated in adult mice using the Hebb-Williams maze. Methods: Adolescent OF1 mice were exposed to EtOH (1.25 g/kg) on two consecutive days at 48-h intervals over a 14-day period (from PD 29 to 42). MDMA (10 or 20 mg/kg) was injected twice daily at 4-h intervals over two consecutive days, and this schedule was repeated six days later (PD 33, 34, 41 and 42), resulting in a total of eight injections. Animals were initiated in the Hebb-Williams maze on PND 64. The concentration of brain monoamines in the striatum and hippocampus was then measured. Results: At the doses employed, both EtOH and MDMA, administered alone or together, impaired learning in the Hebb-Williams maze, as treated animals required more time to reach the goal than their saline-treated counterparts. The groups treated during adolescence with EtOH, alone or plus MDMA, also presented longer latency scores and needed more trials to reach the acquisition criterion score. MDMA induced a decrease in striatal DA concentration, an effect that was augmented by the co-administration of EtOH. All the treatment groups displayed an imbalance in the interaction DA/serotonin. Conclusions: The present findings indicate that the developing brain is highly vulnerable to the damaging effects of EtOH and/or MDMA, since mice receiving these drugs in a binge pattern during adolescence exhibit impaired learning and memory in adulthood."
"1811","1","Ayahuasca and tobacco smoking cessation: results from an online survey in Brazil.^
Rationale: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples’ experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00–1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00–4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85–0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience. Given the current burden of smoking-related disease and the limited treatment options, studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in smoking cessation."

"4848","1","Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^
An unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period. This study suggests that high potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be more effective than low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD."
"7530","0","Classic psychedelics do not affect T cell and monocyte immune responses.^
Introduction: Classic psychedelics have been shown to exert therapeutic potential for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, neuropsychiatric diseases, and neuronal damage. Besides their psychopharmacological activity, psychedelics have been reported to modulate immune functions. There has thus far been a sparse exploration of the direct immune-modulating effect of psychedelics on human immune cells in vitro. Since T cells are key mediators of several immune functions, inhibition of their function would increase the risk of infections. Methods: We investigated the effect of the classic psychedelics lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline on the proliferation and stimulated cytokine release of primary human T lymphocytes and on the stimulated NF-κB induction of monocytes. Results: We did not observe any relevant direct immune-modulatory effects of the tested classic psychedelics in either cell line. Discussion: We concluded that LSD, psilocin, DMT, or mescaline did not directly stimulate the proliferation or cytokine secretion of primary human T lymphocytes or stimulate NF-κB induction of monocytes. Our findings support the future safe use of classic psychedelics in assisted psychotherapy in patients with life-threatening diseases where immune suppression and diminished immune function would be detrimental."

BACKGROUND: Psilocybin, the primary psychoactive component of psychedelic 'magic mushrooms', may have potential for treating depressive symptoms, and consequent applications for bipolar disorder (BD). Knowledge of the risks and benefits of psilocybin in BD is limited to case studies. AIM: To support the design of clinical trials, we surveyed experiences of psilocybin use in people with BD. METHODS: An international web-based survey was used to explore experiences of psilocybin use in people with a self-reported diagnosis of BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses, with a focus on positive experiences of psilocybin use. RESULTS: A total of 541 people completed the survey (46.4% female, mean 34.1 years old). One-third (32.2%; n = 174) of respondents described new/increasing symptoms after psilocybin trips, prominently manic symptoms, difficulties sleeping and anxiety. No differences in rates of adverse events overall were observed between individuals with BD I compared to BD II. Use of emergency medical services was rare (n = 18; 3.3%), and respondents (even those who experienced adverse effects) indicated that psilocybin use was more helpful than harmful. Quantitative findings elaborated on perceived benefits, as well as the potential for psilocybin trips to contain both positively and negatively received elements. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective benefits of psilocybin use for mental health symptoms reported by survey participants encourage further investigation of psilocybin-based treatments for BD. Clinical trials should incorporate careful monitoring of symptoms, as data suggest that BD symptoms may emerge or intensify following psilocybin use."
"6516","0","Dose-Response Pharmacological Study of Mephedrone and Its Metabolites: Pharmacokinetics, Serotoninergic Effects, and Impact of <i>CYP2D6</i> Genetic Variation.^
Mephedrone (MEPH), the most widely consumed synthetic cathinone, has been associated with acute toxicity episodes. The aim of this report was to study its metabolic disposition and the impact of genetic variation of CYP2D6 on MEPH metabolism, in a dose range compatible with its recreational use. A randomized, crossover, phase I clinical trial was performed. Subjects received 50 and 100 mg (n = 3) and 150 and 200 mg (n = 6) of mephedrone and were genetically and phenotypically characterized for the CYP2D6 allelic variation. Our results showed a linear kinetics of mephedrone at the dose range assayed: plasma concentrations, cardiovascular and subjective effects, and blood serotonin concentrations all correlated in a dose-dependent manner. Mephedrone metabolic disposition is mediated by CYP2D6. Mephedrone pharmacology presented a linear dose-dependence within the range of doses tested. The metabolism of mephedrone by CYP2D6 implies that recreational users with no or low CYP2D6 functionality are exposed to unwanted acute toxicity episodes."

3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; ecstasy] evokes a multifaceted subjective experience in human users which includes stimulation, feelings of well-being, mood elevation, empathy towards others as well as distortions in time, sensation and perception. Aspects of this unique psychopharmacology of MDMA are thought to be related to its potent actions to release serotonin (5-HT) and indirectly stimulate the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). In the present studies, we examined the interrelationship between down-regulation of 5-HT2AR expression and the behaviorally stimulatory effects generated by acute administration of (+)-MDMA, the most potent enantiomer of (±)-MDMA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated with the preferential 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4- iodoamphetamine (DOI) which has been shown to down-regulate expression of the 5-HT2AR, but not the closely related 5-HT2CR. While chronic DOI treatment did not alter the functional sensitivity of either the 5-HT2AR or 5-HT2CR, this regimen enhanced (+)-MDMA-evoked hyperactivity. Subsequent analysis of c-Fos and 5-HT2AR immunoreactivity in brain sections demonstrated that DOI treatment decreased the number of (+)-MDMA-induced c-Fos immunopositive nuclei and 5-HT2AR immunostaining in select cortical and striatal areas. These results indicate that chronic DOI exposure results in an enhanced behavioral response to (+)-MDMA and in a pattern of neuronal activation which resembles that seen in psychostimulant sensitization. These data also suggest that expression of the 5-HT2AR in the NAc and PFC may play a role in the sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects of (+)-MDMA and in the processes of neural regulation upon repeated psychostimulant administration. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"8566","0","Screening for drugs of abuse in oral fluid - Correlation of analysis results with serum in forensic cases.^
The testing of saliva or oral fluid at the roadside could be a powerful tool to detect drivers under the influence of drugs and has several advantages over urine screening. In 177 cases of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, oral fluid was collected at the roadside and analyzed in parallel to serum samples. The study was performed to investigate the variability of oral fluid analysis results in relation to blood/serum. In 45% of the cases single-drug use was found, and in 50% poly-drug use was found. Cannabis was most prevalent (78%), and 70% of these individuals were also positive for tetrahydrocannabinol in serum. Overall, 97% of oral fluid samples positive for any substance were also positive in serum. Comparing data of oral fluid and serum for amphetamine, MDMA, morphine, benzoylecgonine, and tetrahydrocannabinol, the sensitivities were 100%, 97%, 87%, 87%, and 92%, respectively. Overall specificity and accuracy were in the range of 91-98%. Discrepancies between a negative oral fluid sample and a positive serum sample could be explained by analytical insensitivity in the lower volume of oral fluid analyzed (estimated for 0.1 mL confirmation vs. 1 mL of serum) or a shorter detection window in oral fluid. The low prevalence of discrepancies with positive oral fluid and negative serum results (2-9% of the cases) may be explained by persistent oral contamination especially for orally consumed drugs, like MDMA and cannabis. It is concluded that the detection of a psychoactive substance in oral fluid taken at the roadside is highly predictive for the detection of the corresponding drug or its metabolite in serum. Oral fluid testing is therefore suitable for the efficient confirmation of drug use of drivers suspected of being under the influence of drugs."
"7815","1","Depressive and anxiety symptomatology in ecstasy users: The relative contribution of genes, trauma, life stress and drug use.^
Rationale: Previous research has identified elevated rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms amongst ecstasy users; however, few studies have examined which factors increase the likelihood of experiencing such symptoms. Objectives: The current study aimed to determine the relationship between ecstasy use and depressive/anxiety symptomatology after controlling for known environmental and genetic (polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene) risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Timeline methods were used to collect information on lifetime and recent ecstasy use, as well as recent other drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Results: Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These results highlight the need to consider the role of environmental factors when examining the relationship between ecstasy use and mood symptoms. Whether ecstasy exacerbates such symptoms in vulnerable individuals requires further investigation using prospective designs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
"2087","0","Report on psychoactive drug use among adolescents using ayahuasca within a religious context.^
Ritual use of ayahuasca within the context of the Brazilian ayahuasca churches often starts during late childhood or early adolescence. Premature access to psychoactive drugs may represent a risk factor for drug misuse. Conversely, religious affiliation seems to play a protective role in terms of substance abuse. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of drug use in a sample of adolescents using ayahuasca within a religious setting. Forty-one adolescents from a Brazilian ayahuasca sect were compared with 43 adolescents who never drank ayahuasca. No significant differences were identified in terms of lifetime substance consumption. Throughout the previous year period, ayahuasca adolescents used less alcohol (46.31%) than the comparison group (74.4%). Recent use of alcohol was also more frequent among the latter group (65.1%) than among ayahuasca drinkers (32.5%). Although not statistically significant, slight differences in terms of patterns of drug use were definitely observed among groups. Despite their early exposure to a hallucinogenic substance, adolescents using ayahuasca in a controlled setting were mostly comparable to controls except for a considerably smaller proportion of alcohol users. Religious affiliation may have played a central role as a possible protective factor for alcohol use. Thus, ayahuasca seems to be a relatively safe substance as far as drug misuse is concerned."
"3689","1","Intraoperative ketamine administration to prevent delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive complications are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Ketamine has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects in various settings. This systematic review evaluates the effects of intraoperative ketamine administration on postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). METHODS: Medline, Embase and Central were searched to 4 March 2018 without date or language restrictions. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intraoperative ketamine administration versus no intervention in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD. Non-cognitive adverse events, mortality and length of stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence (GRADE approach) was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration. Risk ratios were calculated for binary outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. We planned to explore the effects of age, specific anaesthesia regimen, depth of anaesthesia and intraoperative haemodynamic events through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included. The incidence of postoperative delirium did not differ between groups (4 trials, 557 patients, RR 0.83, 95% CI [0.25, 2.80]), but patients receiving ketamine seemed at lower risk of POCD (3 trials, 163 patients, RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15, 0.73]). However, both analyses presented limitations. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was deemed low (postoperative delirium) and very low (POCD). CONCLUSION: The effect of ketamine on postoperative delirium remains unclear but its administration may offer some protection towards POCD. Large, well-designed randomised trials are urgently needed to further clarify the efficacy of ketamine on neurocognitive outcomes."

BACKGROUND: New Mexico was the first state to list post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as a condition for the use of medical cannabis. There are no published studies, other than case reports, of the effects of cannabis on PTSD symptoms. The purpose of the study was to report and statistically analyze psychometric data on PTSD symptoms collected during 80 psychiatric evaluations of patients applying to the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program from 2009 to 2011. METHODS: The Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) was administered retrospectively and symptom scores were then collected and compared in a retrospective chart review of the first 80 patients evaluated. RESULTS: Greater than 75% reduction in CAPS symptom scores were reported when patients were using cannabis compared to when they were not. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis is associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms in some patients, and prospective, placebo-controlled study is needed to determine efficacy of cannabis and its constituents in treating PTSD."
"9172","0","Leveraging Neuroplasticity to Enhance Adaptive Learning: The Potential for Synergistic Somatic-Behavioral Treatment Combinations to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Depression.^
Until recently, therapeutic development in psychiatry was targeted solely toward symptom reduction. While this is a worthwhile goal, it has yielded little progress in improved therapeutics in the last several decades in the field of mood disorders. Recent advancements in our understanding of pathophysiology suggests that an impairment of neuroplasticity may be a critical part of the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interventions that enhance or modulate neuroplasticity often reduce depressive symptoms when applied as stand-alone treatments. Unfortunately, when treatments are discontinued, the disease state often returns as patients relapse. However, treatments that enhance or modulate plasticity not only reduce symptom burden, but also may provide an opportune window wherein cognitive or behavioral interventions could be introduced to harness a state of enhanced neuroplasticity and lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Here, we review the potential of synergistically combining plasticity-enhancing and behavioral therapies to develop novel translational treatment approaches for depression. After reviewing relevant neuroplasticity deficits in depression, we survey biological treatments that appear to reverse such deficits in humans, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (ketamine, D-cycloserine), electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial brain stimulation. We then review evidence that either directly or indirectly supports the hypothesis that a robust enhancement of neuroplasticity through these methods might promote the uptake of cognitive and behavioral interventions to enhance longer-term treatment outcomes through a synergistic effect. We identify key missing pieces of evidence and discuss future directions to enhance this emerging line of research."
"8498","1","AUD Readmission Risk Lower With Pre-Discharge Ketamine Infusion or Naltrexone Injection.^
Introduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans [1], leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million inpatient admissions [2]. Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to initiate addiction recovery, and two single‐dose, adherenceindependent, pharmacologic interventions ‐ intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone ‐ are well‐suited to administer before discharge. However, their feasibility and effectiveness at reducing re‐admissions among AUD inpatients are not well established. Methods: Our open‐label pilot trial randomized participants to 1) IM naltrexone injection, 2) IV ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced‐linkage alone. Adult (age 18‐65), hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past‐year hospital encounter were recruited through an addiction consultation service at an urban, safety‐net hospital. Exclusion criteria included psychiatric instability, severe hepatic or cardiac disease, chronic or planned opioid use, and other severe substance use disorders. The primary aim was to test feasibility, and the primary clinical outcome was 30‐day, all‐cause re‐admission rate. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30‐day emergency department (ED) visit rate and 14‐day outpatient addiction clinic follow‐up rate. Results: Participants (n = 44) were mean 45.1 years‐old, 20.5% female, 56.8% white/Caucasian, 34.1% Hispanic, 61.4% stably housed. All interventions were feasible, with approximately 3.8 participants recruited per month, no serious adverse events reported, and 90.9% with complete inpatient protocol adherence. For the linkage‐alone (LA), naltrexone (NTX), and ketamine (KET) arms, the thirty‐day readmission rates were 41.2, 21.4, and 15.4% respectively. Thirty‐day emergency department rates were 70.6, 57.1, and 53.9% respectively. Fourteen‐day follow up rates were 41.2, 50.0, and 61.5% respectively. Comparing the KET arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission was 0.37 (P = 0.17). Comparing the NTX arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission 0.52 (P = 0.27) DISCUSSION: A single ketamine infusion or naltrexone injection given pre‐discharge, combined with enhanced treatment linkage, are feasible and may reduce readmission rates among medically hospitalized patients with AUD, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with Dakwar et al. [3] who demonstrated beneficial effects with a single ketamine infusion compared to their active control, midazolam, among a lower‐acuity AUD population. IM naltrexone ‐ representing an aspirational standard of care ‐ also demonstrated favorable outcomes compared to the LA arm. A lack of blinding may have introduced expectancy effects for the two pharmacologic interventions. Moreover, despite randomization, the linkage alone arm appeared to be more housing insecure, male, and predisposed to care utilization than the other arms. The ketamine arm had a lower baseline daily quantity of alcohol than the other arms. Next steps include further dissemination of results and planning a larger, blinded trial. If effective in recovery initiation, IV ketamine and/or IM naltrexone could represent a novel addition to the inpatient standard of care for AUD. Conclusions: In this randomized pilot trial among hospitalized AUD patients, both the ketamine infusion and naltrexone injection arms showed lower readmission rates and higher outpatient follow‐up rates compared to the linkage alone arm, though results were not statistically significant."

RATIONALE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that has wide-ranging negative effects on an individual's health and interpersonal relationships. Treatments with long-term benefits are needed to promote the safety and well-being of those suffering from PTSD. OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term change in PTSD symptoms and additional benefits/harms after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD. METHODS: Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2 months after the last active MDMA session (treatment exit), and at least 12 months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was summarized at each time point. Participants completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in CAPS-IV total severity scores from baseline to treatment exit (LS mean (SE) = - 44.8 (2.82), p < .0001), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.91). CAPS-IV scores continued to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE) = - 5.2 (2.29), p < .05), with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.04, 0.43). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study participation. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2 months after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12 months post-treatment. Phase 3 trials are investigating this novel treatment approach in a larger sample of participants with chronic PTSD.

A cross-sectional study, was conducted among the 163 adolescents in Kermanshah County, were randomly selected to participate voluntarily in the study. Participants filled out a self-administered questionnaire. Data were analyzed by SPSS-16 using bivariate correlations and logistic regression statistical tests. Almost 6.8% of the participants had used ecstasy. The TPB variables accounted for 21% of the variation in the outcome measure of the intention to ecstasy use. The best predictor for ecstasy use was subjective norms with odds ratio estimate of 1.679 [95% CI: 1.203, 2.342]. Based on our result, it seems that designing and implementation of educational programs to reduce subjective norm toward ecstasy use could be usefulness of the results in order to prevent of ecstasy use."
"1003","1","A comparison between experimental and authentic blood/serum ratios of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine.^
This paper compares the blood-to-serum distribution (B/S ratio) of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its major metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). B/S ratios were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis following liquid-liquid extraction as a function of the hematocrit value (experimental specimens) and in blood and corresponding serum samples (n = 63) from 16 healthy volunteers participating in a controlled driving experiment (authentic specimens). A regression analysis to calculate the B/S ratio was performed followed by an analysis of covariances (ANCOVA). A linear relationship between the hematocrit value and the B/S ratio of both MDMA and MDA could be established from the experimental data. For MDMA, the regressions provided mean B/S ratios of 1.22 and 1.26 for the experimental setting and the authentic samples, respectively. For MDA, the analysis determined slopes of 1.15 and 1.27 for the experimental setting and field study, respectively. ANCOVA revealed that the method of determination (experimental vs. authentic specimens) did not influence the resulting slopes. A conversion factor of 0.80 may give an adequate estimate to derive the serum concentration for MDMA if only the concentration in whole blood is known, whereas such a definitive factor could not be established for MDA because of its very low levels in authentic samples."
"2162","1","Effect of Esketamine Nasal Spray on Olfactory Function and Nasal Tolerability in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results from Four Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Studies.^
BACKGROUND: Intranasal drug delivery offers a non-invasive and convenient dosing option for patients and physicians, especially for conditions requiring chronic/repeated-treatment administration. However, in some cases such delivery may be harmful to nasal and olfactory epithelia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of long-term intermittent treatment with esketamine nasal spray, taken in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (AD), on olfactory function and nasal tolerability in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: A total of 1142 patients with TRD participated from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III studies: three short-term studies (two in patients aged 18-64 years, one in patients ≥65 years), and one long-term maintenance study of esketamine nasal spray + AD versus placebo nasal spray + AD. Across the four studies, assessments were performed at 208 sites in 21 countries. Olfactory function was measured using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT(®)) and the single-staircase Snap & Sniff(®) Odor Detection Threshold Test (S&S-T). Nasal tolerability, including nasal examinations and a quantitative, self-administered nasal symptom questionnaire (NSQ), was also assessed. Data were analyzed using analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Of 1142 participants, 734 were women (64.3%). The mean age of all participants ranged from 45.7 to 70.0 years across the studies. Overall, 855 patients received esketamine nasal spray + AD and 432 received placebo nasal spray + AD. Objective evaluation of nasal function showed no evidence of an adverse impact following esketamine administration. Based on the UPSIT(®) and S&S-T results, intranasal administration of esketamine had no effect on the odor identification or threshold test scores compared with placebo nasal spray + oral AD. Similarly, repeated administration with esketamine nasal spray had no meaningful impact on assessments of nasal function. No dose-response relationship was observed between esketamine doses and the olfactory test scores. Esketamine nasal spray was well tolerated, as indicated by responses on the NSQ and negative nasal examination findings. CONCLUSION: Findings from this analysis indicate that there was no evidence of adverse effect on either olfactory or nasal health measures with repeated intermittent administration of esketamine nasal spray at any dose over the course of short-term (4 weeks) or long-term (16-100 weeks) studies.

"1616","1","Psychosocial determinants of ecstasy use in young people in the UK.^
Objectives. The present research aimed to examine the psychosocial determinants of ecstasy use in young people in the UK. Design. Two studies applied the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to understanding ecstasy use. In Study 1, students completed questionnaires measuring components of the TPB. In Study 2, a random sample of members of a nightclub completed measures of attitudinal ambivalence and components of the TPB in relation to taking ecstasy in the next two months. Reported use of ecstasy was assessed two months later. Methods. Both studies employed self-completion questionnaires. In Study 1 a single questionnaire was completed by 186 students. In Study 2 a first questionnaire was completed by 203 members of a nightclub and a second questionnaire two months later by 123 respondents. Results. In Study 1, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control accounted for 50 per cent of the variance in intentions. In Study 2, TPB components explained 63 per cent of the variance in intentions. Intentions and perceived control explained 55 per cent of the variance in subsequent ecstasy use. Attitudinal ambivalence moderated the intention-behaviour relationship such that the impact of intentions on subsequent behaviour was significantly stronger for individuals with lower levels of ambivalence. Conclusions. The TPB provided a good basis for understanding intentions and actual use of ecstasy in young people in the UK. The different beliefs of users and non-users may form a useful basis for health education."
"2026","1","Ketamine, lidocaine and combination for postoperative analgesia in liver resection: a randomized controlled trial.^
Introduction: Abdominal wall incisions used for liver surgeries are associated with significant postoperative pain and disability. Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for major abdominal surgery and is shown to have superior analgesia when compared to systemic analgesia[i]. However, its use is controversial[ii]. Lidocaine and ketamine both are being used for perioperative analgesia. Perioperative lidocaine infusion has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption[iii]. Perioperative low dose Ketamine has shown improved postoperative pain and reduced opioid usage[iv]. , therefore,re tested the hypothesis that the combination would provide better analgesia in the milieu of intrathecal morphine. Methods: After institutional ethics approval and written informed consent, we randomized 124 adult ASA 1‐4 patients scheduled for open liver resection to one of four groups. Intraoperatively, group L received lidocaine infusion, group K received ketamine infusion, group LK received lidocaine and ketamine infusion and group P received saline infusion. All patients received 300 mics intrathecal morphine prior to induction of standardized anesthesia and all infusions were started immediately after the intubation and continued until the end of surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received hydromorphone via a PCA device and its consumption recorded for 3 days. Data regarding other side effects was also recorded. Primary outcome measurements included pain scores and opioid consumption at 24 hrs. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and opioid consumption at 48 and 72 hrs and side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headaches and signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Data analysis included 113 patients. There was no difference in pain scores within all 4 groups at rest or movement at 24 hrs. Mean 48 hrs rest pain scores were 3.1, 1.7, 2.3 and 1.7 in L, K, KL and P groups respectively (p<0.03 between groups, unadjusted for multiple testing procedures). Pain scores were not significantly different at all other time points. All opioids were converted to morphine equivalents. Opioid use was less in ketamine group at 48 hrs but did not reach statistical significance. The total 72 hr use was not significantly different across the groups. There was no difference in side effects between the groups at any time points. Conclusions: In this triple blind, parallel group four‐arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trial, lidocaine, ketamine or their combination did not add any benefit over single dose intrathecal morphine with patient controlled hydromorphone analgesia. There was a trend towards better analgesia at 48 hrs with ketamine alone but reduction in opioid use was not significant."
"2077","1","Pahnke's 'Good Friday experiment': A long-term follow-up and methodological critique.^
To investigate the potential of psychedelic drugs to facilitate mystical experience, W. Pahnke (1963) administered psilocybin or placebo to 20 White male Protestant divinity students before Good Friday services. The present study critiques the preparation phase of the experiment, Pahnke's questionnaire for measuring mystical experience, and completeness of his reporting. Between 1986 and 1989, the present author recorded personal interviews with 16 of the original Ss. All 16 were readministered the 100-item questionnaire used for 6-mo follow-up in the original experiment. The original experiment found that psilocybin Ss who experienced a mystical experience would, after 6 mo, report a substantial amount of positive, and virtually no negative, persisting changes in attitude and behavior. The present study further supports these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5158","1","Self-administration of Psilocybin in the Setting of Treatment-resistant Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who fail to respond to two or more antidepressants are often considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Many of the current options for TRD have significant side effect profiles, are expensive, and are difficult to access. There has been a revival of psychedelic research in recent years that shows promising results in the treatment of TRD. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, the case of a 43-year-old man with TRD is presented. TRD symptoms were greatly interfering with his life. He underwent psychological testing, lab work, adequate trials of numerous medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electroconvulsive therapy, all without adequate relief of his symptoms. The patient began self-administering a microdosing regimen of psilocybin and experienced significant improvement of MDD symptoms, as characterized by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). DISCUSSION: In recent years, multiple randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the benefit of psilocybin in the treatment of varying types of depression. One trial evaluated psilocybin and escitalopram as treatments for depression, and psilocybin was found to be superior. CONCLUSION: This case suggests the possible benefit of psilocybin in the setting of TRD, as outlined in recent research. Additional research is needed to confirm these observations."
"9036","1","Information processing speed in ecstasy (MDMA) users.^
Previous research draws parallels between ecstasy-related and age-related deficits in cognitive functioning. Age-related impairments in working memory have been attributed to a slow down in information processing speed. The present study compared 29 current ecstasy users, 10 previous users and 46 non-users on two tests measuring information processing speed and a computation span task measuring working memory. Results showed that ecstasy users performed worse than non-ecstasy users in the letter comparison task although the overall difference was not significant (p = 0.089). Results from the pattern recognition task showed that current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < 0.01). When results were combined for both the letter and pattern tasks, once again current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than non-ecstasy users (p < 0.01). Working memory deficits obtained were statistically significant with both ecstasy using groups performing significantly worse than non-users on the computation span measure (p < 0.01). Moreover, ANCOVA with measures of processing speed as covariates failed to eliminate the group difference in computation span (p < 0.01). Therefore, it is likely the mechanism responsible for impairments in the computation span measure is not the same as that in elderly adults where processing speed generally removes most of the age-related variance. Also of relevance is the fact that the ecstasy users reported here had used a range of other drugs making it difficult to unambiguously attribute the results obtained to ecstasy use.

"366","0","Oral Ketamine for Depression, 2: Practical Considerations.^
The oral route of administration is probably the least expensive and most convenient way to administer ketamine in indicated contexts in depressed patients. Because only 20%-25% of orally administered ketamine reaches systemic circulation, oral doses of about 2.0-2.5 mg/kg may need to be administered to achieve equivalence to intravenously administered ketamine. In case reports, case series, standard operating practice in ketamine facilities, and randomized controlled trials, oral ketamine has been administered through weight-based dosing and as fixed doses, and the dosing strategy has been one-size-fits-all or individualized through a dose discovery process. Administered doses have ranged from 0.25 to 7.0 mg/kg in weight-based dosing sessions and from 25 mg to 300 mg in fixed dosing sessions. This article reviews strategies for dosing with oral ketamine, dose discovery procedures, rates of dosing during a session, the frequency of dosing sessions and the duration of treatment, treatment in the clinic vs domiciliary treatment, adverse effects and risks, and safety issues. Finally, this article provides a detailed account of practices and experiences with oral ketamine so that readers may know what to expect when the treatment is orally administered. Whereas oral ketamine appears to be a safe and effective treatment and could make ketamine an accessible and affordable intervention in less privileged medical facilities, readers are warned that the literature on oral ketamine is thin and that there are many areas that need more investigation, especially matters related to pharmacokinetics, physiologic effects, abuse potential and strategies to mitigate illicit use, and adverse effects and efficacy relative to other routes of administration. Until studies of a sufficiently high quality become available, the use of oral ketamine to treat depression must be considered experimental."
"8976","1","Ketamine for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders: comprehensive systematic review.^
BACKGROUND: In the past two decades, subanaesthetic doses of ketamine have been demonstrated to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, and accumulating research has demonstrated ketamine's therapeutic effects for a range of psychiatric conditions. AIMS: In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. METHOD: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. RESULTS: We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further."

This trial is designed to evaluate efficacy and psychological mechanisms of single‐dose psilocybin‐assisted psychotherapy (PAP) to treat psychiatric (depression, anxiety) and existential distress (demoralization, death anxiety), and quality‐of‐life (QOL), in 200 outpatients with late‐stage (stage 3 or 4) cancer. The study will assess the strength and durability of therapeutic effects in a double‐blind, parallel‐design, placebo‐controlled, two‐center RCT comparing a single 25mg oral 'high' dose of psilocybin to a single 1mg 'very low' (clinically non‐therapeutic) dose active control psilocybin, both delivered in conjunction with a psychotherapy platform."
"4475","1","Adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking following the use of magic mushrooms.^
Background: Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used for recreational, spiritual, self-development and therapeutic purposes. However, physiologically relatively nontoxic, adverse reactions are occasionally reported. Aims: This study investigated the 12-month prevalence and nature of magic mushroom-related adverse reactions resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking in a global sample of people reporting magic mushroom use. Methods: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey – a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Results: Out of 9233 past year magic mushroom users, 19 (0.2%) reported having sought emergency medical treatment, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.06%. Young age was the only predictor associated with higher risk of emergency medical presentations. The most common symptoms were psychological, namely anxiety/panic and paranoia/suspiciousness. Poor ‘mindset’, poor ‘setting’ and mixing substances were most reported reasons for incidents. All but one respondent returned back to normality within 24 h. Conclusions: The results confirm psilocybin mushrooms are a relatively safe drug, with serious incidents rare and short lasting. Providing harm-reduction information likely plays a key role in preventing adverse effects. More research is needed to examine the detailed circumstances and predictors of adverse reactions including rarer physiological reactions."

Aims γ-Hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is used as a treatment for narcolepsy and alcohol withdrawal and as a recreational substance. Nevertheless, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of GHB in humans. We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile and exposure-psychotropic effect relationship of GHB in humans. Methods Two oral doses of GHB (25 and 35 mg kg-1) were administered to 32 healthy male subjects (16 for each dose) using a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Results Maximal concentrations of GHB were (geometric mean and 95% CI): 218 (176-270) nmol ml-1 and 453 (374-549) nmol ml-1 for the 25 and 35 mg kg-1 GHB doses, respectively. The elimination half-lives (mean ± SD) were 36 ± 9 and 39 ± 7 min and the AUC∞ values (geometric mean and 95% CI) were 15 747 (12 854-19 290) and 40 113 (33 093-48 622) nmol/min ml-1 for the 20 and 35 mg kg-1 GHB doses, respectively. Thus, plasma GHB exposure (AUC0-∞) rose disproportionally (+40%) with the higher dose. γ-Hydroxybutyrate produced mixed stimulant-sedative effects, with a dose-dependent increase in sedation and dizziness. It did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A close relationship between plasma GHB exposure and its psychotropic effects was found, with higher GHB concentrations associated with higher subjective stimulation, sedation, and dizziness. No clockwise hysteresis was observed in the GHB concentration effect plot over time (i.e., no acute pharmacological tolerance). Conclusion Evidence was found of a nonlinear dose-exposure relationship (i.e., no dose proportionality) at moderate doses of GHB. The effects of GHB on consciousness were closely linked to its plasma exposure and exhibited no acute tolerance."
"6074","1","Geriatric Ketamine for Pain Management Study.^
Elderly patients are making up a greater proportion of the New York State population every year as the nation's overall population continues to age at a rapid pace. Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non‐opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well‐being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an ""opioid‐free"" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double‐blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub‐dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 ‐ 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non‐traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on‐duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e‐mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition on all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research manager and statistician, who will be independent of any data collection."
"3006","1","Knowledge, Perceptions, and Use of Psychedelics among Individuals with Fibromyalgia.^
Fibromyalgia (FM) is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition for which there is strong interest in alternative treatments. There is growing interest in the potential of psychedelic substances (e.g., psilocybin) in conjunction with psychotherapy to treat chronic pain. Via a cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey, we aimed to characterize knowledge, perceptions, and past use of serotonergic (""classic"") and non-serotonergic psychedelics among a population of individuals with FM, and to investigate interest in psychedelic-based FM treatments. Among a North American population of 354 participants with FM, 29.9% reported past use of a psychedelic, with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms being most commonly used. Perceptions of benefit from psychedelic use were generally neutral (59.4%) or positive (36.8%), with <3% reporting negative impacts on overall health or pain symptoms. Among 12 participants who used psychedelics with intentions of treating chronic pain, 11 reported improved symptoms. Regardless of past use, the majority of participants believed that psychedelics have potential for chronic pain treatments and would be willing to participate in a psychedelic-based clinical trial for their pain. These findings support the need for additional studies to understand the potential and effectiveness of psychedelic substances in managing FM symptoms."
"5218","0","New Paradigms of Old Psychedelics in Schizophrenia.^
Psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and mescaline exhibit intense effects on the human brain and behaviour. In recent years, there has been a surge in studies investigating these drugs because clinical studies have shown that these once banned drugs are well tolerated and efficacious in medically supervised low doses called microdosing. Psychedelics have demonstrated efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric maladies such as difficult to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and also in treating substance use disorders. The primary mode of action of psychedelics is activation of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors affecting cognition and brain connectivity through the modulation of several downstream signalling pathways via complex molecular mechanisms. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) primarily exhibit pharmacological actions through 5-HT(2A) receptors, which are also the target of psychedelic drugs. Psychedelic drugs including the newer second generation along with the glutamatergic APDs are thought to mediate pharmacological actions through a common pathway, i.e., a complex serotonin-glutamate receptor interaction in cortical neurons of pyramidal origin. Furthermore, psychedelic drugs have been reported to act via a complex interplay between 5HT(2A), mGlu2/3, and NMDA receptors to mediate neurobehavioral and pharmacological actions. Findings from recent studies have suggested that serotoninergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions are very closely connected in producing pharmacological responses to psychedelics and antipsychotic medication. Emerging hypotheses suggest that psychedelics work through brain resetting mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to dig deeply into psychedelic neurobiology to uncover how psychedelics could best be used as scientific tools to benefit psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia."

"3722","1","Neural Correlates of the Shamanic State of Consciousness.^
Psychedelics have been recognized as model interventions for studying altered states of consciousness. However, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness, which is anecdotally similar to the psychedelic state, exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by an assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals in a previous study under the influence of psychedelics. Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered states of consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Furthermore, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenal traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state."

OBJECTIVE: Due to the presence of pain during nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion and related complications and lack of positive clinical response of nasopharyngeal anesthesia with lidocaine and the related side effects and limitations in ketamine and intravenous midazolam, this study aims to determine the efficacy of oral midazolam in relieving pain in the patients requiring NGT insertion. METHODS: A randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was performed on the patients in the Emergency Department of Zanjan Valiasr and Mousavi Hospitals in Iran, who were nominated for NGT. In each group, 100 patients were examined. Two milligram syrups of midazolam and placebo were administered 20 min before the procedure. In two groups, the pain based on the Visual Analog Scale and satisfaction rate of patients during the NGT insertion were compared. The data were analyzed through the SPSS software version 16.0. FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of two groups. Despite the effects of potential confounding variables, the cause of the referral and indication of NGT, as well as the use of midazolam syrup, had a significant relationship with the outcome, so that midazolam group experienced less pain. The mean and standard deviation of the examined outcomes (feeling of pain and satisfaction with NGT insertion) was statistically significantly different in the midazolam group as compared to the placebo group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Midazolam was effective in decreasing pain and increasing the satisfaction of patients after NGT insertion. This manuscript is registered in Irct. com with code IRCT20110629006922N4."
"6321","1","Psychotomimetic effects of single-dose ketamine in children: exploring effects of age and alpha-2 agonist pretreatment.^
Background: Sub‐anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonist drugs have been used for conscious sedation and treatment of pain and depression in humans, including clinical use in children for burn management and fracture reductions where ketamine offers less respiratory depression than a commonly used combination of midazolam‐fentanyl. However, NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent, transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children. Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade ‐along with limited clinical observations‐ suggest 1) that NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent (i.e., expressed postpuberty) and 2) that certain treatments ‐like alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists‐ may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity, with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha‐2 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects. We report on a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of the effect of the alpha‐2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single‐dose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department (ED) setting. The study hypothesized 1) ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects, and 2) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a) younger age and b) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine. Methods: Children ages 7‐17 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized (stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of <12 vs. >12 years‐of‐age children in each group) to co‐administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures. Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg), medical assessments, patient stabilization, and informed consent, participants were administered dexmedetomidine (0.7 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine. Adverse events were recorded using a clinician‐administered adverse events and side effects scale. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) was administered prior to ketamine dose, during ketamine treatment, and again prior to discharge from the emergency room, with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre‐ketamine to on‐ketamine condition. Cognitive testing was obtained following on‐ketamine BPRS ratings. Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA (ANCOVA when baseline values were non‐zero), using time as the repeated measure (pre‐ vs. during ketamine), and treatment condition (dexmedetomidine vs. saline) and age (<12 vs. >12) as independent variables. Results: Forty children (mean age: 11.0 years (SD = 2.3 years), 70.0% male, 22.5% black) were randomized to ketamine+saline (n =18) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine (n= 22). Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects, consistent with prior reports of dose‐dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans. BPRS positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, peculiar fantasies), absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment, were manifested during ketamine treatment, as indicated by a significant main effect of time (F[1,36] =19.98, p<0.0001). A trend‐level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed (F[1,36]=3.93, p =0.055), explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre‐treatment. Frequently reported (>5%, baseline‐corrected) side effects were sedation (56.3%), dizziness (50.0%), “pleasant” dreams (31.4%) and visual hallucinations (29.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that singledose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well‐controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures, with generally well‐tolerated adverse events, consistent with prior reports. However, ketamine treatment in children, as in adults, is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2) that pretreatment with alpha‐2 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain. Future studies are needed to better characterize these effects."

It should be emphasised that Table 1 in the Analysis1 combines data from Phase 2 trials (including open-label and placebo-controlled trial periods) and Phase 3 trials (placebo-controlled efficacy studies, a maintenance of effect study and a long-term open label safety study) submitted by Janssen to the FDA (as indicated by superscript 'b' in the Table), therefore the data does not represent a randomised comparison, and definitive causal inferences cannot be drawn. As indicated by the denominators for each entry there were more patients exposed to esketamine than placebo (and for longer periods) which may be one reason for the higher numbers of suicides in the esketamine group. However, it is worth noting other data that suggest that increased suicidality may be a feature of esketamine treatment. In the long-term safety study 14.5% of patients on esketamine (in a population selected for their lack of active suicidality) reported 'treatment-emergent' suicidal ideation (114/784), 6 patients attempted suicide in addition to the one completed suicide.2 Furthermore, a recent analysis of post-marketing surveillance data reported to the FDA for the 12 months since esketamine was licensed in the US there have already been 64 reports of suicidal ideation, 11 completed suicides, and 6 attempted suicides attributed to esketamine.3 This represents a 24-fold increased risk of report for suicidal ideation for esketamine compared with other drugs, and a 6-fold increased risk for completed suicide.3 The authors of this paper concluded that the safety of esketamine required ""urgent clarification.""3 It should also be clarified that although ketamine is not used routinely as an anaesthetic agent in high-income countries, like the UK, because of its unfavourable balance of risks and harms, it is used more frequently in low-income countries."
"3096","1","Impaired cognitive performance in drug free users of recreational ecstasy (MDMA).^
OBJECTIVES: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and related congerers: MDA, MDEA) is the name given to a group of popular recreational drugs. Animal data raise concern about neurotoxic effects of high doses of ecstasy on central serotonergic systems. The threshold dose for neurotoxicity in humans is not clear and serotonin is involved in several functions including cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate cognitive performance in a group of typical recreational ecstasy users. METHODS: A comprehensive cognitive test battery was administered to 28 abstinent ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only and to two equally sized matched groups of cannabis users and non-users. The sample consisted of ecstasy users with a typical recreational use pattern and did not include very heavy users. RESULTS: Ecstasy users were unimpaired in simple tests of attention (alertness). However, they performed worse than one or both control groups in the more complex tests of attention, in memory and learning tasks, and in tasks reflecting aspects of general intelligence. Heavier ecstasy and heavier cannabis use were associated with poorer performance in the group of ecstasy users. By contrast, the cannabis users did not differ significantly in their performance from the non-users. CONCLUSIONS: The present data raise concern that use of ecstasy possibly in conjunction with cannabis may lead to cognitive decline in otherwise healthy young people. Although the nature of the emerging cognitive disturbance is not yet clear, an impairment of working memory might be the common denominator underlying or contributing to declines of performance in various tasks. The cognitive disturbance is likely to be related to the well recognised neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. The data suggest that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause neurotoxicity in humans."

Cancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

"2094","1","The drug purity discounting task: Ecstasy use likelihood is reduced by probabilistic impurity according to harmfulness of adulterants.^
BACKGROUND: Ecstasy typically contains adulterants in addition to, or in lieu of, MDMA which may pose a greater risk to users than MDMA itself. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adulterant-related informational prompts in reducing Ecstasy use using a novel probability discounting task. METHODS: An online sample of past-month Ecstasy users (N = 278) were randomized to one of four different framing prompt conditions: no prompt; a prompt describing MDMA's effects; a prompt describing adulterants as inert ""filler""; or a prompt describing adulterants as pharmacologically-active, potentially-harmful compounds. Each prompt contained general, potential public-health information that was not specifically related to subsequent behavioral tasks. All participants then completed an identical Drug Purity Discounting Task, in which they indicated the likelihood of using a sample of Ecstasy across different probabilities of the sample being impure, and then completed a hypothetical Ecstasy purchasing task. RESULTS: Likelihood of Ecstasy use decreased as impurity probability increased across conditions. Ecstasy use likelihood was highest in the ""inert"" prompt condition, whereas pharmacologically-active adulterant or adulterant-nonspecific prompts resulted in comparably low likelihood of use. Ecstasy-use likelihood did not differ among conditions when the likelihood of sample impurity was 0. Ecstasy purchasing did not differ among groups. Inelastic purchasing was associated with greater likelihood of using potentially-impure Ecstasy. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data highlight the necessity of education regarding pharmacologically-active, rather than inert, adulterants in Ecstasy, and suggest that increased access to drug checking kits and services may mitigate some of the harms associated with Ecstasy use."
"5840","0","Psychedelic-induced mystical experiences: An interdisciplinary discussion and critique.^
Contemporary research on serotonergic psychedelic compounds has been rife with references to so-called 'mystical' subjective effects. Several psychometric assessments have been used to assess such effects, and clinical studies have found quantitative associations between 'mystical experiences' and positive mental health outcomes. The nascent study of psychedelic-induced mystical experiences, however, has only minimally intersected with relevant contemporary scholarship from disciplines within the social sciences and humanities, such as religious studies and anthropology. Viewed from the perspective of these disciplines-which feature rich historical and cultural literatures on mysticism, religion, and related topics-'mysticism' as used in psychedelic research is fraught with limitations and intrinsic biases that are seldom acknowledged. Most notably, existing operationalizations of mystical experiences in psychedelic science fail to historicize the concept and therefore fail to acknowledge its perennialist and specifically Christian bias. Here, we trace the historical genesis of the mystical in psychedelic research in order to illuminate such biases, and also offer suggestions toward more nuanced and culturally-sensitive operationalizations of this phenomenon. In addition, we argue for the value of, and outline, complementary 'non-mystical' approaches to understanding putative mystical-type phenomena that may help facilitate empirical investigation and create linkages to existing neuro-psychological constructs. It is our hope that the present paper helps build interdisciplinary bridges that motivate fruitful paths toward stronger theoretical and empirical approaches in the study of psychedelic-induced mystical experiences."

Reports an error in 'Ketamine metabolite pilot study in a suicidal depression trial' by Michael F. Grunebaum, Hanga C. Galfalvy, Tse-Hwei Choo, Michelle S. Parris, Ainsley K. Burke, Raymond F. Suckow, Thomas B. Cooper and J. John Mann (Journal of Psychiatric Research, 2019[Oct], Vol 117, 129-134). In the original article, there was an error in Figure 1 which shows the amine and aryl group moved one carbon over on the cyclohexanone structure whereas they should be next to the ketone. A corrected Figure 1 can be found in the NIHMS manuscript, but was too late for the journal publication. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-49924-018[/rid]). Ketamine shows promise as a rapidly-acting treatment for depression and suicidal ideation, but side effects and abuse potential limit its use. Understanding its mechanism of action could help develop analogous but safer drugs. This post hoc study explored relationships of ketamine and metabolites, including hydroxynorketamine enantiomers, (2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-HNK, to clinical response in a subgroup from a published trial in suicidal depression. Depressed adults with clinically significant suicidal ideation were randomized to double-blind infusion of sub-anesthetic ketamine or midazolam. Ketamine and metabolites were measured after infusion (N = 53). Plasma (2R,6R)-HNK was associated with change (higher levels correlated with less clinical improvement) from baseline to 24 h post-infusion of depression (HDRS-24: Spearman r = 0.37, p = 0.009) and suicidal thoughts (SSI: Spearman r = 0.29, p = 0.041). There were similar correlations with weekly follow-up clinical rating scores for both HNK enantiomers and dehydronorketamine (DHNK). Ketamine and norketamine were not associated with change in depression or suicidal ideation (unadjusted p > 0.28). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"1295","1","Greater empathy in MDMA users.^
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely known for its positive acute effects on social behaviour, such as increasing empathy, whilst also attenuating the negative impact of social exclusion. However there is a scarcity of research that investigates the long-term impact of recreational MDMA use on these fundamental social processes. Method: Sixty-seven individuals were split into three groups based on their drug-use history: poly-drug MDMA users (n = 25), poly-drug users who do not use MDMA (n = 19), alcohol-only users (n = 23), and were tested in an independent groups design. Participants completed both a self-report measure of emotional and cognitive empathy, along with the Multifaceted Empathy Task – a computerised assessment of empathy – and the Cyberball Game – a social exclusion paradigm. Results: MDMA users had significantly greater subjective emotional empathy, and greater cognitive empathy on the computer task compared with the poly-drug users who do not use MDMA. There were no significant differences in subjective responses to social exclusion between the groups. Indices of MDMA use did not correlate with empathy. Conclusions: Long-term MDMA users in this sample exhibited normal psychosocial functioning in regard to empathy and social pain and had higher subjective emotional empathy. This conflicts with previous suggestions that moderate, long-term MDMA use may cause heightened social distress, and is further evidence of the safety of the drug, which is relevant to considerations of its therapeutic use."
"9158","1","Substance usage intention does not affect attentional bias: implications from Ecstasy/MDMA users and alcohol drinkers.^
Background: An attentional bias towards substance-related stimuli has been demonstrated with alcohol drinkers and many other types of substance user. There is evidence to suggest that the strength of an attentional bias may vary as a result of context (or use intention), especially within Ecstasy/MDMA users. Objective: Our aim was to empirically investigate attentional biases by observing the affect that use intention plays in recreational MDMA users and compare the findings with that of alcohol users. Method: Regular alcohol drinkers were compared with MDMA users. Performance was assessed for each group separately using two versions of an eye-tracking attentional bias task with pairs of matched neutral, and alcohol or MDMA-related visual stimuli. Dwell time was recorded for alcohol or MDMA. Participants were tested twice, when intending and not intending to use MDMA or alcohol. Note, participants in the alcohol group did not complete any tasks which involved MDMA-related stimuli and vice versa. Results: Significant attentional biases were found with both MDMA and alcohol users for respective substance-related stimuli, but not control stimuli. Critically, use intention did not affect attentional biases. Attentional biases were demonstrated with both MDMA users and alcohol drinkers when usage was and was not intended. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the robust nature of attentional biases i.e. once an attentional bias has developed, it is not readily affected by intention."
"9611","1","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^
Presents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.

Also, on page 103, the reference to McCabe et al. 2004b should have read McCabe et al. in press. (The following abstract of this article originally appeared in record [rid]2004-21894-018[/rid].) Aims: To examine the prevalence rates and correlates of non-medical use of prescription stimulants (Ritalin, Dexedrine or Adderall) among US college students in terms of student and college characteristics. Design: A self-administered mail survey. Setting: One hundred and nineteen nationally representative 4-year colleges in the United States. Participants: A representative sample of 10 904 randomly selected college students in 2 001. Measurements: Self-reports of non-medical use of prescription stimulants and other substance use behaviors. Findings: The life-time prevalence of non-medical prescription stimulant use was 6.9%, past year prevalence was 4.1% and past month prevalence was 2.1%. Past year rates of non-medical use ranged from zero to 25% at individual colleges. Multivariate regression analyses indicated non-medical use was higher among college students who were male, white, members of fraternities and sororities and earned lower grade point averages. Rates were higher at colleges located in the north-eastern region of the US and colleges with more competitive admission standards. Non-medical prescription stimulant users were more likely to report use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and other risky behaviors. Conclusions: The findings of the present study provide evidence that non-medical use of prescription stimulants is more prevalent among particular subgroups of US college students and types of colleges. The non-medical use of prescription stimulants represents a high-risk behavior that should be monitored further and intervention efforts are needed to curb this form of drug use.

"5752","0","The role of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase in rapid antidepressant action of ketamine.^
Major depressive disorder is a devastating mental disorder. Current antidepressant medications can be effective for some patients with depression; however, these drugs exert mood-elevating effects only after prolonged administration, and a sizable fraction of the patient population fails to respond to treatment. There is an urgent need for faster-acting antidepressants with reliable treatment outcomes and sustained efficacy for individuals with depression, in particular those contemplating suicide. Recent clinical studies report that ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, shows fast-acting antidepressant action, thus bringing fresh perspective into preclinical studies investigating novel antidepressant targets and treatments. Our recent studies show that the effects of ketamine are dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and subsequent activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB. Our findings also suggest that the fast-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine require rapid protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in robust increases in dendritic BDNF protein levels that are important for the behavioral effect. These findings also uncover eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a Ca²⁺/calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates eEF2 and regulates the elongation step of protein translation, as a major molecular substrate mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Our results show that ketamine-mediated suppression of resting NMDA receptor activity leads to inhibition of eEF2 kinase and subsequent dephosphorylation of eEF2 and augmentation of BDNF synthesis. This article outlines our recent studies on the synaptic mechanisms that underlie ketamine action, in particular the properties of eEF2K as a potential antidepressant target."

p-Methoxymethamphetamine (PMMA) is an illegal psychedelic drug of abuse derived from an amphetamine structure with a risk to health and reports of several cases of intoxications and fatalities caused by its ingestion. However, its pharmacokinetics based on a controlled study is unknown and only partial information on its biotransformation in animal models is available. Our experimental design aimed to study the disposition and kinetic profile of PMMA and its metabolites in rat plasma and selected tissues after the bolus subcutaneous dose of 40 mg/kg, using a GC-MS method. Prior to this, we performed a qualitative verification of its metabolites appearing in excreted urine fractions. PMMA maximum plasma concentration of 4014 +/- 1122 ng/mL was reached 30 min after dosing, whereas the appearance of metabolites was rather delayed. The disposition of PMMA was characterized by its approximate half-life of 1.0 h, volume of distribution of 6.4 L/kg and plasma clearance of 4.4 L/h. PMMA tissue concentration exceeded plasma and the highest one was found in the lungs (c(max) 42,988 +/- 10,223 ng/g). Penetration through the blood/brain barrier was more efficient considering PMMA and its N-desmethylated metabolite PMA (para-methoxyamphetamine) than hydroxylated metabolites. The maximum brain/plasma ratio value of PMMA (15.8) and PMA (11.8) was reached after 8 h of observation. The experimental results ascertained could be useful for subsequent evaluation of the psychotropic or neurotoxic effects of PMMA and for diagnostic concern of intoxication.

A double blind trial of orally administered fenfluramine was conducted in 7 nonobese adults with various neurological disorders. Caloric intake and body weight fell significantly after 8 days of treatment although there was no definite change in appetite ratings. Average central turnover of serotonin, as estimated by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation of 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA) during probenecid loading, decreased by 66%. No significant change in homovanillic acid, the major dopamine product, was apparent. The results support the contention that the effect of fenfluramine on human dietary intake may be mediated by alterations in serotonergic rather than dopaminergic mechanisms."
"6635","1","Shifting characteristics of ecstasy users ages 12–34 in the United States, 2007–2014.^
Background: Ecstasy/MDMA has been one of the most prevalent party drugs for decades, and powder ecstasy recently increased in popularity. We examined trends in use to determine who to best target for prevention and harm reduction. Methods: Secondary analysis of the 2007–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative probability sample, was conducted. Linear trends in past-year ecstasy use and trends in demographic and other past-year substance use characteristics among ecstasy users were examined among participants ages 12–34 (N = 332,560). Results: Past-year prevalence of ecstasy use was stable across years at 2% (P = 0.693). Over time, the proportion of ecstasy users with a college degree increased from 11.5% in 2007/08 to 24.5% in 2013/14 (P < 0.001). The proportion of users who were age 12–17 decreased, as did proportions of users who are non-Hispanic black, and reported income <$20,000/year (Ps < 0.001). Prevalence of past-year use of marijuana, LSD, ketamine, and DMT/AMT/Foxy increased among ecstasy users (Ps < 0.05); DMT/AMT/Foxy use increased more than four-fold from 2.1% in 2007/08 to 8.7% in 2013/14. Perception of great risk associated with LSD use decreased among users and ease of obtaining LSD increased (Ps < 0.05). Past-year use of 5 or more other substances also increased over time (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Ecstasy use in the US appears to be increasing among those with college degrees and use of other substances among ecstasy users is growing—particularly use of otherwise rare substances such as tryptamines. Results inform prevention and harm reduction strategies in this increasingly shifting group of ecstasy users."
"5001","1","Baseline cognitive function predicts full remission of suicidal symptoms among patients with treatment-resistant depression and strong suicidal ideation after low-dose ketamine infusion.^
BACKGROUND: Whether pretreatment working memory and response inhibition function are associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and strong suicidal ideation is unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 65 patients with TRD, comprising 33 who received a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 32 who received a placebo infusion. The participants performed working memory and go/no-go tasks prior to infusion. We assessed suicidal symptoms at baseline and on postinfusion Days 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: The full remission of suicidal symptoms persisted for 3 days after a single ketamine infusion and the ketamine-related antisuicidal effect persisted for 1 week. Lower cognitive impairment at baseline (indicated by a higher rate of correct responses on a working memory task) was associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine in patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation but low cognitive impairment may benefit the most from the antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine."

Recent research found lasting increases in personality trait Openness in healthy individuals and patients after administration of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT(2A) R) agonist psilocybin. However, no studies have investigated whether 5-HT(2A) R availability as imaged using positron emission tomography (PET) is associated with this trait. In 159 healthy individuals (53 females), the association between 5-HT(2A) R binding in neocortex imaged with [(18) F]altanserin or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 PET and personality trait Openness was investigated using linear regression models. In these models the influence of sex on the association was also investigated. Trait Openness was assessed with the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. No significant associations between neocortical 5-HT(2A) R binding and trait Openness were found for [(18) F]altanserin (p = 0.5) or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 (p = 0.8). Pooling the data in a combined model did not substantially change our results (p = 0.4). No significant interactions with sex were found (p > 0.35). Our results indicate that differences in 5-HT(2A) R availability are not related to variations in trait Openness in healthy individuals. Although stimulation of the 5-HT(2A) R with compounds such as psilocybin may contribute to long-term changes in trait Openness, there is no evidence in favor of an association between 5-HT(2A) R and trait Openness."

Previous studies have suggested that marijuana (cannabis sativa) and delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (delta9-THC), the major psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, are effective in the therapy of tics and associated behavioral disorders in Tourette Syndrome (TS). Because there is also evidence that cannabis sativa may cause cognitive impairment in healthy users, we performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial for delta9-THC in 12 adult TS patients to investigate whether treatment of TS with a single dose of delta9-THC at 5.0 to 10.0 mg causes significant side effects on neuropsychological performance. Using a variety of neuropsychological tests, we found no significant differences after treatment with delta9-THC compared to placebo treatment in verbal and visual memory, reaction time, intelligence, sustained attention, divided attention, vigilance, or mood. Only when using the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) did our data provide evidence for a deterioration of obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB) and a trend towards an increase in phobic anxiety. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as SCL-90-R has known limitations on measuring OCB. We suggest that the increase in phobic anxiety is mainly due to the fact that a single-dose treatment rules out the possibility of administering the dosage slowly. In contrast to results obtained from healthy marijuana users, a single-dose treatment with delta9-THC in patients suffering from TS does not cause cognitive impairment. We therefore suggest that further investigations should concentrate on the effects of a longer-term therapy of TS with delta9-THC."
"8287","1","Evaluation of clinical factors associated with adverse drug events in patients receiving sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions.^
Introduction: Sub-anesthetic ketamine is frequently used as an analgesic to reduce perioperative opioid consumption and has also been shown to have antidepressant effects. Side effects of ketamine include dizziness, diplopia, nystagmus, and psychomimetic effects. It is unclear what clinical factors may be associated with ketamine-related adverse drug events (ADEs). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 95 patients who received sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions at our institution. Data examined associations between ketamine-related ADEs and various clinical characteristics including chronic pain, depression, or psychiatric disorder, patient physical characteristics, chronic opioid use, perioperative opioid use, dose and duration of ketamine infusions, pain scores, and perioperative medications such as serotonergic agents, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and analgesics. Results: Overall incidence of ketamine-related ADEs was 29.5% and the incidence of psychomimetic effects was 14.8%. We observed that patients with a history of depression have a lower incidence of ketamine-related ADEs compared to patients without a history of depression (10.3% vs 37.3%; p value = 0.007). Conclusion: Patients with depression were found to have a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ketamine-related ADEs. We found no statistically significant positive associations between ketamine-related ADEs and other clinical factors such as a history of chronic pain, psychiatric disease, patient physical characteristics, perioperative opioid use, dose of ketamine infusion, or co-administration of other CNS depressants."

Hallucinogenic mushrooms have been used in religious and cultural ceremonies for centuries. Of late, psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, has received increased public interest as a novel drug for treating mood and substance use disorders (SUDs). In addition, in recent years, some states in the United States have legalized psilocybin for medical and recreational use. Given this, clinicians need to understand the potential benefits and risks related to using psilocybin for therapeutic purposes so that they can accurately advise patients. This expert narrative review summarizes the scientific basis and clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for treating psychiatric disorders and SUDs. The results of this review are structured as a more extensive discussion about psilocybin's history, putative mechanisms of action, and recent legislative changes to its legal status. There is modest evidence of psilocybin-assisted therapy for treating depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, early data suggest that psilocybin-assisted therapy may effectively reduce harmful drinking in patients with alcohol use disorders. The evidence further suggests psilocybin, when administered under supervision (psilocybin-assisted therapy), the side effects experienced are mild and transient. The occurrence of severe adverse events following psilocybin administration is uncommon. Still, a recent clinical trial found that individuals in the psilocybin arm had increased suicidal ideations and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors. Given this, further investigation into the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy is warranted to determine which patient subgroups are most likely to benefit and which are most likely to experience adverse outcomes related to its use."

Bipolar disorder (type 1) is a serious and chronic psychiatric illness that can be difficult to treat. Many bipolar patients have refractory depressive episodes. Racemic ketamine, a glutamate modulator with prominent dissociate and psychedelic properties, has been demonstrated to have rapid acting antidepressant and anti-obsessional effects which may be useful for treating the symptoms of bipolar depression. Most of the existing research literature on unipolar and bipolar depression has looked at racemic ketamine in the sub-psychedelic dose range given by infusion as a stand-alone treatment (without concurrent psychotherapy). This article expands on the existing research by articulating three different paradigms for ketamine treatment: biochemical, psychotherapeutic, and psychedelic. The authors use composite clinical vignettes to illustrate different ways of working with ketamine to treat bipolar depression, and discuss a variety of clinical considerations for using ketamine with this population, including route, dose, frequency, chemical mitigators, and adverse events. Note that the conceptual paradigms could be applied to any ketamine treatment, with broad applicability beyond bipolar treatment."

Patients who have not responded to two antidepressant trials in their current depressive episode are usually considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). A detailed search on PubMed was conducted for reported response and remission rates for non-ketamine and ketamine treatments for TRD. From a variety of pharmacological and brain stimulation open-label studies, the treatments were found to have similar response and remission rates of 30% to 70% and 20% to 50%, respectively. For randomized placebo-controlled trials, reported response and remission rates were 15% to 60% and 10% to 40%, respectively. Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy both have response and remission rates at the higher end of these ranges, and their significant advantage is their fast action in an acute setting. Direct comparative efficacy studies with large sample sizes will be needed to establish any margin of increased benefit of one treatment modality compared to the other.

"7338","1","Psilocybin-induced changes in cerebral blood flow are associated with acute and baseline inter-individual differences.^
Research into the use of psilocybin for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is a growing field. Nevertheless, robust brain-behavior relationships linking psilocybin-induced brain changes to subjective drug-induced effects have not been established. Furthermore, it is unclear if the acute neural effects are dependent on individual heterogeneity in baseline characteristics. To address this, we assessed the effects of three oral doses of psilocybin vs. placebo on cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling in healthy participants (N = 70; n = 31, 0.16 mg/kg; n = 10, 0.2 mg/kg; n = 29, 0.215 mg/kg). First, we quantified psilocybin-induced changes in relative and absolute CBF. Second, in an exploratory analysis, we assessed whether individual baseline characteristics and subjective psychedelic experience are associated with changes in CBF. Psychological and neurobiological baseline characteristics correlated with the psilocybin-induced reduction in relative CBF and the psilocybin-induced subjective experience. Furthermore, the psilocybin-induced subjective experience was associated with acute changes in relative and absolute CBF. The results demonstrated that inter-individual heterogeneity in the neural response to psilocybin is associated with baseline characteristics and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the psychedelic-induced altered state. Overall, these findings help guide the search for biomarkers, paving the way for a personalized medicine approach within the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy."

"2813","1","Central nervous system-related safety and tolerability of add-on ketamine to standard of care treatment in treatment-resistant psychotic depression in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.^
BACKGROUND: Psychotic treatment-resistant depression represents a complex and challenging form of mood disorder in clinical practice. Despite its severity, psychotic depression is frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Ketamine has demonstrated rapid and potent antidepressant effects in clinical studies, while exhibiting a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Although there is limited literature available on the use of ketamine in psychotic TRD, reports on its efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile are of great interest to clinicians. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between dissociative symptomatology and psychomimetic effects in inpatients with treatment-resistant major psychotic depression and treatment-resistant bipolar psychotic depression, who receive intravenous ketamine treatment alongside psychotropic medication, both during and after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant unipolar (17 patients) or bipolar (18 patients) depression with psychotic features were treated with eight intravenous infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine twice a week over 4 weeks. Ketamine was given in addition to their standard of care treatment. The severity of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the MADRS, while dissociative and psychomimetic symptoms were assessed using the CADSS and BPRS, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes observed in MADRS, CADSS, and BPRS scores within the study group during ketamine infusions. However, significant improvements in MADRS, CADSS, and BPRS scores were observed during ketamine infusions in both the unipolar and bipolar depression groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the lack of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in both unipolar and bipolar depression."

BACKGROUND: Ketamine is an emerging drug used in the management of undifferentiated, severe agitation in the prehospital setting. However, prior work has indicated that ketamine may exacerbate psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to describe psychiatric outcomes in patients who receive prehospital ketamine for severe agitation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted at two tertiary academic medical centers, utilizing chart review of patients requiring prehospital sedation for severe agitation from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients received either intramuscular (IM) versus intravenous (IV) ketamine or IM versus IV benzodiazepine. The primary outcome was psychiatric inpatient admission with secondary outcomes including ED psychiatric evaluation and nonpsychiatric inpatient admission. Generalized estimating equations and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare cohorts. RESULTS: During the study period, 141 patient encounters met inclusion with 59 (42%) receiving prehospital ketamine. There were no statistically significant differences between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts for psychiatric inpatient admission (6.8% vs. 2.4%, difference = 4.3%, 95% CI = -2% to 12%, p = 0.23) or ED psychiatric evaluation (8.6% vs. 15%, difference = -6.8%, 95% CI = -18% to 5%, p = 0.23). Patients with schizophrenia who received ketamine did not require psychiatric inpatient admission (17% vs. 10%, difference = 6.7%, 95% CI = -46% to 79%, p = 0.63) or ED psychiatric evaluation (17% vs. 50%, difference = -33%, 95% CI = -100% to 33%, p = 0.55) significantly more than those who received benzodiazepines, although the subgroup was small (n = 16). While there was no significant difference in the nonpsychiatric admission rate between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts (35% vs. 51%, p = 0.082), nonpsychiatric admissions in the benzodiazepine cohort were largely driven by intubation (63% vs. 3.8%, difference = 59%, 95% CI = 38% to 79%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of prehospital ketamine for severe agitation was not associated with an increase in the rate of psychiatric evaluation in the emergency department or psychiatric inpatient admission when compared with benzodiazepine treatment, regardless of the patient's psychiatric history."
"9106","0","Early Warning System for Illicit Drug Use at Large Public Events: Trace Residue Analysis of Discarded Drug Packaging Samples.^
Inspired by Locard's exchange principle, which states ""every contact leaves a trace"", a trace residue sampling strategy has been developed for the analysis of discarded drug packaging samples (DPS), as part of an early warning system for illicit drug use at large public events including music/dance festivals. Using direct analysis in real time/mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, rapid and high-throughput identification and characterization of a wide range of illicit drugs and adulterant substances was achieved, including in complex polydrug mixtures and at low relative ion abundances. A total of 1362 DPS were analyzed either off-site using laboratory-based instrumentation or on-site and in close to real time using a transportable mass spectrometer housed within a mobile analytical laboratory, with each analysis requiring less than 1 min per sample. Of the DPS analyzed, 92.2% yielded positive results for at least one of 15 different drugs and/or adulterants, including cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine, as well as numerous novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Also, 52.6% of positive DPS were found to contain polydrug mixtures, and a total of 42 different drug and polydrug combinations were observed throughout the study. For analyses performed on-site, reports to key stakeholders including event organizers, first aid and medical personnel, and peer-based harm reduction workers could be provided in as little as 5 min after sample collection. Following risk assessment of the potential harms associated with their use, drug advisories or alerts were then disseminated to event staff and patrons and subsequently to the general public when substances with particularly toxic properties were identified."

"8554","1","DMT Models the Near-Death Experience.^
Near-death experiences (NDEs) are complex subjective experiences, which have been previously associated with the psychedelic experience and more specifically with the experience induced by the potent serotonergic, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Potential similarities between both subjective states have been noted previously, including the subjective feeling of transcending one's body and entering an alternative realm, perceiving and communicating with sentient 'entities' and themes related to death and dying. In this within-subjects placebo-controled study we aimed to test the similarities between the DMT state and NDEs, by administering DMT and placebo to 13 healthy participants, who then completed a validated and widely used measure of NDEs. Results revealed significant increases in phenomenological features associated with the NDE, following DMT administration compared to placebo. Also, we found significant relationships between the NDE scores and DMT-induced ego-dissolution and mystical-type experiences, as well as a significant association between NDE scores and baseline trait 'absorption' and delusional ideation measured at baseline. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap in nearly all of the NDE phenomenological features when comparing DMT-induced NDEs with a matched group of 'actual' NDE experiencers. These results reveal a striking similarity between these states that warrants further investigation."
"6569","1","Shank3 as a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine and its neural correlates in bipolar depression.^
BACKGROUND: Shank3, a post-synaptic density protein involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor tethering and dendritic spine rearrangement, is implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that elevated baseline plasma Shank3 levels might predict antidepressant response to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with bipolar depression received a double-blind, randomized, subanesthetic dose (.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Of the patients for whom Shank3 levels were collected, 15 completed baseline 3-Tesla MRI and 17 completed post-ketamine [(18)F]-FDG PET. RESULTS: Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 (r=-.39, p=.047), 2 (r=-.45, p=.02), and 3 (r=-.42, p=.03) and were associated with larger average (r=.58, p=.02) and right amygdala volume (r=.65, p=.009). Greater baseline Shank3 also predicted increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus (r=.51, p=.04) and amygdala (r=.58, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size, inability to assess the source of peripheral Shank3, and the lack of a placebo group for baseline Shank3 levels and comparative structural/functional neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS: Shank3 is a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine that correlates with baseline amygdala volume and increased glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus."
"7077","1","Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^
BACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study."
"2206","0","Augmenting the Treatment of PTSD with Ketamine—a Review.^
Purpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 6.1% in the general adult population. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of PTSD suggest the use of trauma-focused psychotherapies such as prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). As a second-level intervention, these guidelines suggest the use of psychotropic medications, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). To date, however, studies have shown that both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments have limited efficacy, with remission rates around 40–70% and dropout rates of up to 50%. This paper reviews a new and emerging treatment approach of medication-augmented psychotherapy for PTSD, with an emphasis on augmenting prolonged exposure therapy (PE) with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion. Based on animal and human research on fear extinction and memory reconsolidation, neurobiological changes that emerge following a ketamine infusion can enhance learning and thus benefit exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD. Summary: Medication-augmented exposure-based psychotherapies represent a promising direction for the treatment of PTSD, with some positive results in small-scale studies. More studies (phase 2 and 3) should be performed to determine if this multimodal treatment approach may help mitigate PTSD symptoms in trauma-exposed individuals who do not respond to standard monotherapeutic approaches. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."

Objective: Aim of this study was to study sociodemographic, clinical characteristics and extent of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among patients applied by probation. Methods: The file records of the 215 cases who gave at least one urine-blood sample applied to Izmir Ataturk Education and Research Hospital Addiction Unit Probation Policlinic at February 2010 have been assessed retrospectively. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of substance use and CAGE (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener) scores and blood %CDT (carbohydrate-deficient transferring) results of cases were used to detect AUD. SPSS 15.0 program has been used for the statistical assessment. Results: The average age of the sample was 29.4±9.1 year and most of the patients were male (%99.5). The lifetime prevalence of substances was cannabis %99.5, ecstasy %17.2, benzodiazepine %11.6, cocaine %5.6, heroin %0.9 and inhalants %0.9. %10.2 patients were positive for urine samples. %8.8 patient were positive for cannabis and %3.2 were positive for benzodiazepine. Urine samples positive group had higher unemployment rates (χ2=8.72, p=0.003) and higher CAGE scores (χ2=5.08, p=0.024). %37.2 patients had positive %CDT and %25.6 patients had positive CAGE scores. Discussion: The most important finding of this study is that higher unemployment rates in urine positive group and high AUD rates in all patients. The relationship between unemployment and substance use show that social and employment rehabilitation programs with medical treatment is important. High AUD rates show the importance of evaluating alcohol use in treatment."

During the past few years, efavirenz has been increasingly used in the treatment of HIV1 infection. Its main side effect is a syndrome of central nervous system stimulation occurring in 40-50% of adults in the first few weeks of therapy which might be observed at increased frequency in subjects concurrently using recreational substances. We therefore conducted a single center, retrospective study in 134 patients treated with efavirenz and found no significant differences in CNS side effects or discontinuation rates between recreational substance (cocaine, ecstasy, cannabis) users and non-users.

"1301","0","The schizophrenia ketamine challenge study debate.^
Protection of subjects in psychiatric research is an issue of considerable public and professional interest. Perhaps the most hotly debated issue concerns challenge study protocols where symptoms of illness are increased in a bioassay designed to gain knowledge of pathophysiology. Although widely used in biomedical research, the ethics of this application in mental illness research are contested. At issue is whether acute distress and lasting harm are caused without direct benefit in vulnerable subjects without valid informed consent. The ketamine challenge study in schizophrenia subjects is at the vortex of the current debate. This report presents background data on ketamine safety and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from all schizophrenia subjects in North American ketamine studies. Duration and severity of change in psychosis and anxiety, ""worst case"" experiences, and information on prolonged adverse effects are detailed. The vulnerable population and informed consent issue is discussed. Group results show that psychosis increase is mild to moderate and brief, anxiety is mild and brief, and no evidence of prolonged adverse effects is found. Few ""worst case"" incidents were identified, and these were clinically managed successfully in a short time period. Although more difficult to evaluate, informed consent procedures seem adequate, and consent was voluntary in subjects judged to have decisional capacity for this purpose and in circumstances where alternative clinical care could be freely chosen. The author concludes that ketamine challenge studies meet ethical standards, have been conducted without lasting adverse effects, that discomfort is modest and brief, and important new knowledge has been gained of potential benefit to the class from which subjects were drawn."
"6734","0","COMPARING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO FORMS OF TIME-SPACE SAMPLING TO IDENTIFY CLUB DRUG-USING YOUNG ADULTS.^
Time-space sampling has been used to generate representative samples of both hard-to-reach and location-based populations. Because of its emphasis on multi-tiered randomization (i.e., time, space, and individual), some have questioned the feasibility of time-space sampling as a cost-effective strategy. In an effort to better understand issues related to drug use among club-going young adults (ages 18 to 29) in the New York City nightlife scene, two variations of time-space sampling methods were utilized and compared (Version 1: randomized venue, day, and individuals within venues: Version 2: randomized venue and day). A list of nightlife venues were randomized and survey teams approached potential participants as they entered or exited venues to conduct brief anonymous surveys. Over the course of 24 months, 18,169 approaches were conducted and 10,678 consented to complete the brief questionnaire (V1 response rate = 46.0%, V2 response rate = 62.5%). Drug use was fairly common, with nearly two-thirds of the sample reporting having ever tried an illegal drug and more than half of drug users specifically tried either MDMA/ecstasy and/or cocaine. There were few differences between young adults surveyed during Version 1 and Version 2. Time-space sampling is an effective strategy to quickly detect and screen club drug users. Although caution is urged, elimination of the third tier of randomization (i.e., individual level counting) from time-space sampling may significantly improve response rates while only minimally impacting sample characteristics."
"4634","1","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^
Objective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB."
"2646","0","Ethnoracial health disparities and the ethnopsychopharmacology of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies.^
Emerging evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests psychedelic compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), when administered as an adjunct to psychotherapy, that is, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), may be beneficial for treating substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. Previous ethnopsychopharmacological research has identified ethnoracial differences in the metabolism, safety, and efficacy of psychotropic drugs, yet no studies have directly investigated the impact of ethnoracially based differences in psychedelic drug pharmacology. Although there is an extensive global history of psychedelic use among peoples of various cultures, ethnicities, and intersectional identities, psychedelic research has been conducted almost exclusively on White populations in North America and Western Europe. The failure to include Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in psychedelic research trials neglects the ethnic, racial, and cultural factors that may impact individual responses to PAP and thereby prevents generalizability of findings. This article investigates the impact of biological and social factors related to culture, ethnicity, and race on pharmacological responses to PAP, as well as clinical outcomes. The limitations of ethnopsychopharmacology are discussed, and the authors present expected cultural, clinical, and public health benefits of expanding funding for this area. This work will draw attention to the unique and individualized needs of ethnoracially diverse clients in therapeutic settings and is intended to inform future PAP trials.

"8854","0","Ketamine use disorder: preclinical, clinical, and neuroimaging evidence to support proposed mechanisms of actions.^
Ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has been exclusively used as an anesthetic in medicine and has led to new insights into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical studies have shown that low subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce antidepressant effects for individuals with depression. However, its use as a treatment for psychiatric disorders has been limited due to its reinforcing effects and high potential for diversion and misuse. Preclinical studies have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's antidepressant effects, but a precise mechanism had yet to be elucidated. Here we review different hypotheses for ketamine's mechanism of action including the direct inhibition and disinhibition of NMDA receptors, AMPAR activation, and heightened activation of monoaminergic systems. The proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and their combined influence may exert the observed structural and functional neural impairments. Long term use of ketamine induces brain structural, functional impairments, and neurodevelopmental effects in both rodents and humans. Its misuse has increased rapidly in the past 20 years and is one of the most common addictive drugs used in Asia. The proposed mechanisms of action and supporting neuroimaging data allow for the development of tools to identify 'biotypes' of ketamine use disorder (KUD) using machine learning approaches, which could inform intervention and treatment."

Grunebaum, James W. Murrough, Colleen Loo, Andrea Cipriani and Keith Hawton (Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 2020[Jan], Vol 54[1], 29-45). In the original article, a statement regarding conflicts of interest should have been included by the author Dr. James W Murrough. This was an inadvertent omission on the part of the author. The statement is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-80175-007[/rid]). Objective: Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression. But it is not known how quickly this occurs and how long it persists. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of ketamine for suicidality. Method: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched until 12 December 2018. Randomised controlled trials of ketamine or esketamine reporting data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, attempted or completed suicide in adults diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = −0.51, 95% confidence interval = [−1.00, −0.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.63, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.57, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

"3492","1","Nature-themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^
INTRODUCTION: Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Set and setting, particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature, may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes. But to date, randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic-assisted therapy are lacking. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Visual Healing, a nature-themed video intervention to optimize set and setting, versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open-label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD. For the first session, participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature-themed videos during the preparation session and the ""ascent"" and ""descent"" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session. For the second session 4 weeks later, participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use, psychedelic effects, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 (95%) randomized participants (mean age 49 ± 11 years, 60% female) completed the 14-week study. During the first psilocybin session, participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42-min video and there were no video-related adverse events. Peak increase in post-psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures. Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects, stress, and anxiety were similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In this open-label pilot study, viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated among participants with AUD. Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy, without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol-related treatment outcomes. Studies to replicate our findings as well as studies of different set and setting interventions with other psychedelic medications and indications are warranted."

A total of 931 urine specimens and associated donor profile data resulting from drug-related arrests made between January and July 2002 were collected from 12 cities/counties throughout Taiwan. Urine specimens were screened on a REMEDi HS drug profiling system. Drug use findings and profile data were subjected to pattern analysis. Results indicated a drug positive rate of 74%, with 39 drugs identified. Opiates and amphetamines were the major drugs of abuse, with detection rate of 40% and 38%, respectively. Drug users were found in all age categories (from 12 to 57 years old), and were predominantly male (M/F ratio > 5). Most arrests were made in residences or along roadways (92%-95% of total arrests). A large number of those arrested had quit school before completing junior high school and many had records of multiple arrests. By contrast, club drugs (MDMA/ketamine) were found in our sample group at lower rates (10% and 5%, respectively). Club drug users tended to be younger (mostly under 27 years old), better educated, and with a smaller gender gap (M/F ratio < 3.5). Club drug users were identified only in four relatively urbanized cities/counties and many arrests were for first offenses. Benzodiazepines (BZ) were found throughout the sample, with a detection rate of 18%. The profile identified for BZ users is similar to that of opiate and amphetamine users, although a higher ratio of BZ users (14%) were arrested in recreational places."

Advanced multiband imaging (MB) pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion MRI data was acquired from patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) (N = 22, mean age=35.2 ± 9.95 SD, 27% female) at baseline, and 24 h after receiving single, and four subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous ketamine infusions. Changes in global and regional CBF were compared across time points, and relationships with overall mood, anhedonia and apathy were examined. Comparisons between patients at baseline and controls (N = 18, mean age=36.11 ± 14.5 SD, 57% female) established normalization of treatment effects. Results showed increased regional CBF in the cingulate and primary and higher-order visual association regions after first ketamine treatment. Baseline CBF in the fusiform, and acute changes in CBF in visual areas were related to symptom improvement after single and repeated ketamine treatment, respectively. In contrast, after serial infusion therapy, decreases in regional CBF were observed in the bilateral hippocampus and right insula with ketamine treatment. Findings demonstrate that neurophysiological changes occurring with single and repeated ketamine treatment follow both a regional and temporal pattern including sensory and limbic regions. Initial changes are observed in the posterior cingulate and precuneus and primary and higher-order visual areas, which relate to clinical responses. However, repeated exposure to ketamine, though not relating to clinical outcome, appears to engage deeper limbic structures and insula. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"
"3813","0","Psychedelics in Psychiatry: Neuroplastic, Immunomodulatory, and Neurotransmitter Mechanisms.^
Mounting evidence suggests safety and efficacy of psychedelic compounds as potential novel therapeutics in psychiatry. Ketamine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in a new class of antidepressants, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is undergoing phase III clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are being investigated in several phase II and phase I clinical trials. Hence, the concept of psychedelics as therapeutics may be incorporated into modern society. Here, we discuss the main known neurobiological therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics, which are thought to be mediated by the effects of these compounds on the serotonergic (via 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors) and glutamatergic [via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] systems. We focus on 1) neuroplasticity mediated by the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin-, brain-derived neurotrophic factor-, and early growth response-related pathways; 2) immunomodulation via effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, nuclear factor ĸB, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1, 6, and 10 production and release; and 3) modulation of serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and norepinephrinergic receptors, transporters, and turnover systems. We discuss arising concerns and ways to assess potential neurobiological changes, dependence, and immunosuppression. Although larger cohorts are required to corroborate preliminary findings, the results obtained so far are promising and represent a critical opportunity for improvement of pharmacotherapies in psychiatry, an area that has seen limited therapeutic advancement in the last 20 years. Studies are underway that are trying to decouple the psychedelic effects from the therapeutic effects of these compounds. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelic compounds are emerging as potential novel therapeutics in psychiatry. However, understanding of molecular mechanisms mediating improvement remains limited. This paper reviews the available evidence concerning the effects of psychedelic compounds on pathways that modulate neuroplasticity, immunity, and neurotransmitter systems. This work aims to be a reference for psychiatrists who may soon be faced with the possibility of prescribing psychedelic compounds as medications, helping them assess which compound(s) and regimen could be most useful for decreasing specific psychiatric symptoms."
"4361","0","Data crowdsourcing on psychomotor and cognitive effects of cannabis via mobile app.^
In an effort to educate consumers of cannabis, we created a downloadable application (app) for mobile phones that collects data on the neuropsychological effects related to cannabis use. In particular, the app assessed four domains, these being: (i) psychomotor compensation, (ii) time estimation, (iii) sustained attention, and (iv) response inhibition. These tests were presented as a sequence of video games to be completed in under 10 min. Included in the analysis were 213 users who indicated that they were intoxicated from cannabis at the moment of app use. The control group contained individuals who reported using the app while sober (n = 137). A machine learning model was applied to the data to determine whether a particular pattern of performance was predictive of intoxication, and these results were used to inform the creation of a composite score that reflected aggregate performance for all four (i-iv) video games. Relative to the control group, the largest performance decrements were discovered within the initial 120 min after self-administration. These deficits abated as the time-since-use lengthened, and this pattern was consistent with the time-course of subjectively reported intoxication. Although significant limitations in interpretation exist due to the naturalistic and self-report data collection method, this proof-of-concept study points toward the potential utility of mobile app detection of cannabis effect.

Reports an error in 'GLYX-13, a NMDA receptor glycine-site functional partial agonist, induces antidepressant-like effects without ketamine-like side effects' by Jeffrey Burgdorf, Xiao-lei Zhang, Katherine L. Nicholson, Robert L. Balster, J. David Leander, Patric K. Stanton, Amanda L. Gross, Roger A. Kroes and Joseph R. Moskal (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2013[Apr], Vol 38[5], 729-742). In the original article, there were some errors in page 2, right column, fifth and sixth lines in the 'Drugs' section. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-10132-003[/rid]). Recent human clinical studies with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine have revealed profound and long-lasting antidepressant effects with rapid onset in several clinical trials, but antidepressant effects were preceded by dissociative side effects. Here we show that GLYX-13, a novel NMDAR glycine-site functional partial agonist, produces an antidepressant-like effect in the Porsolt, novelty induced hypophagia, and learned helplessness tests in rats without exhibiting substance abuse-related, gating, and sedative side effects of ketamine in the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, pre-pulse inhibition and open-field tests. Like ketamine, the GLYX-13-induced antidepressant-like effects required AMPA/kainate receptor activation, as evidenced by the ability of NBQX to abolish the antidepressant-like effect. Both GLYX-13 and ketamine persistently (24 h) enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the magnitude of NMDAR-NR2B conductance at rat Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation studies showed that both GLYX-13 and ketamine led to increases in both NR2B and GluR1 protein levels, as measured by Western analysis, whereas no changes were seen in mRNA expression (microarray and qRT-PCR). GLYX-13, unlike ketamine, produced its antidepressant-like effect when injected directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that GLYX-13 produces an antidepressant-like effect without the side effects seen with ketamine at least in part by directly modulating NR2B-containing NMDARs in the MPFC. Furthermore, the enhancement of 'metaplasticity' by both GLYX-13 and ketamine may help explain the long-lasting antidepressant effects of these NMDAR modulators. GLYX-13 is currently in a Phase II clinical development program for treatment-resistant depression. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

To establish efficacy, we will investigate a single dose of psilocybin versus placebo in a randomised, double‐blinded, placebo‐controlled 12 weeks clinical trial. 90 patients, aged 20‐70 years, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder and treatment seeking will be recruited from the community via advertisement and referrals from general practitioners and hospital units. The psilocybin or placebo is administered within a protocol of psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out one, four, eight‐ and 12 weeks post dosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow‐up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes include 1) phosphatidyl‐ethanol as an objective biomarker for alcohol consumption 2) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range and 3) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome. Furthermore, we will investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of the possible treatment effects by use of functional magnetic resonance brain imaging one week post dosing."
"7263","1","Ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy for depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^
Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for depressive disorder. Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic. However, ketamine cautiously needs to be administered in ECT due to the possibility of increased risk of side effects."
"2817","1","Changes in inflammatory biomarkers are related to the antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca.^
BACKGROUND: Ayahuasca is a traditional Amazon brew and its potential antidepressant properties have recently been explored in scientific settings. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca with treatment-resistant depression patients (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 45). AIMS: We are evaluating the blood inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, as a potential consequence of ayahuasca intake and their correlation with serum cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and 48 hours after substance ingestion to assess the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers, together with administration of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: At pre-treatment, patients showed higher C-reactive protein levels than healthy controls and a significant negative correlation between C-reactive protein and serum cortisol levels was revealed (rho = -0.40, n = 14). C-reactive protein in those patients was not correlated with Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. We observed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein levels across time in both patients and controls treated with ayahuasca, but not with placebo. Patients treated with ayahuasca showed a significant correlation (rho = + 0.57) between larger reductions of C-reactive protein and lower depressive symptoms at 48 hours after substance ingestion (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). No significant result with respect to interleukin 6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was found. Furthermore, these biomarkers did not predict the antidepressant response or remission rates observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and encourage further clinical trials in adults with depression."
"3121","1","Developing a Direct Observation Measure of Therapeutic Connection in Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy: A Feasibility Study.^
Context: Measuring therapeutic connection during psilocybin-assisted therapy is essential to understand underlying mechanisms, inform training, and guide quality improvement. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of directly observing indicators of therapeutic connection during psilocybin administration encounters. Methods: We evaluated audio and video data from a recent clinical trial for observable expressions of therapeutic connection as defined in proposed best-practice competencies (i.e., empathic abiding presence and interpersonal grounding). We selected the first four 8-hour encounters involving unique participants, therapists, and gender pairs. Each video was independently coded by three members of an interprofessional six-person team. Using a structured checklist, coders recorded start-stop times, the audible (i.e., speech prosody or words) and visible (i.e., body movements, eye gaze, and touch) cues marking the event, and the qualities of the interaction (e.g., expression of awe, trust, distress, and calmness). We assessed feasibility by observing the frequency, distribution, and overlap of cues and qualities coders used to identify and define moments of therapeutic connection. Results: Among the 2074 minutes of video, coders recorded 372 moments of therapeutic connection. Eighty-three percent were identified by at least two coders and 41% by all three. Coders used a combination of audible and visual cues to identify therapeutic connection in 51% of observed events (190/372). Both the cues and qualities of therapeutic connection expressions varied over the course of psilocybin temporal effects on states of consciousness. Conclusion: Direct observation of therapeutic human connection is feasible, sensitive to changes in states of consciousness and requires evaluation of audible and visual data."

Over the last few years, there has been a growing tendency for opioid addicts to abuse multiple drugs, although many patients are in substitution therapy with methadone. Abuse of multiple drugs leads to a more complicated withdrawal syndrome; it is therefore necessary to investigate new drug strategies as a treatment for detoxification. Buprenorphine appears to be an effective and safe drug in opioid‐addicted patient detoxification. In this study, we have compared the short‐term efficacy of an 11‐day low‐dose buprenorphine/14‐day carbamazepine regime [BPN/CBZ] (n = 14) to an 11‐day methadone/14‐day carbamazepine regime [MET/CBZ] (n = 12) in a double‐dummy, randomized 14‐day inpatient detoxification treatment study. Twenty‐six inpatients met the DSM‐IV criteria for opioid dependence and were included in this study. All patients abused various additional drugs. Fourteen of 26 patients (53.8 %) completed the study. Seven non‐completers (seven of 12 = 58.3 %) were treated with methadone/carbamazepine and five non‐completers (five of 14 = 35.7 %) received buprenorphine/carbamazepine, but the difference in the dropout rate was not significant. However, patients with buprenorphine/carbamazepine showed significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms after the first two weeks of treatment. The present study supports the hypothesis that buprenorphine/carbamazepine is more effective than methadone/carbamazepine in detoxification strategies for opioid addict with additional multiple drug abuse. No severe side effects occurred during treatment in either group."
"633","1","Ketamine-Associated Intraoperative Electroencephalographic Signatures of Elderly Patients With and Without Preoperative Cognitive Impairment.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine is typically used by anesthesiologists as an adjunct for general anesthesia and as a nonopioid analgesic. It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged ≥65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for ≥3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine."
"2311","0","Quantification of methylone and metabolites in rat and human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.^
Methylone is a commonly abused synthetic cathinone derivative marketed as a “legal” alternative to “ecstasy” or cocaine. Previous studies examined the metabolism of methylone in vitro and in vivo; 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone (HMMC) was identified as the primary metabolite, with other reported minor metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone (MDC) and 3,4-dihydroxymethcathinone (HHMC). However, limited information is known about methylone and its metabolites’ pharmacokinetics. We developed and fully validated a method for the simultaneous quantification of methylone, HMMC, MDC and HHMC by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 100 µl rat and human plasma. β-Glucuronidase was utilized for plasma hydrolysis, followed by perchloric acid protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction utilizing cation exchange columns. Chromatographic separation was performed with a Synergi Polar column in gradient mode, and analytes were determined by two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Linear ranges of 0.5–1,000 µg/l (methylone, HMMC and MDC) and 10–1,000 µg/l (HHMC) were achieved. Bias and imprecision were generally acceptable, although quantification of HHMC exhibited variability (16.2–37 %). Extraction efficiencies and ion suppression were 89.9–104 % (for HHMC, 15.9–16.2 %) and < 11.4 %, respectively. Methylone and metabolites were stable in plasma for 24 h at room temperature, 72 h at 4 °C, and after three freeze–thaw cycles (except for a 60 % HMMC increase). Human and rat plasma were cross-validated, documenting that rat plasma quality control samples were accurately quantified against a human plasma calibration curve (−23.8 to 12 % bias). As proof of method, rat plasma specimens were analyzed pre-injection and after subcutaneous administration of methylone at 6 mg/kg from 15 to 480 min post-dosing. Methylone, HMMC, MDC and HHMC concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 1,310, 11.2 to 194, 1.9 to 152 and 24.7 to 188 µg/l, respectively."

[H(2)(15)O]-Positron Emission Tomography (PET) was used to examine regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) after administration of a single oral dose of the serotonin realeaser and uptake inhibitor MDMA (1.7 mg/kg) or placebo to 16 MDMA-naïve subjects. Psychological changes were assessed by psychometric rating scales. MDMA produced distributed changes in regional blood flow including increases in ventromedial frontal and occipital cortex, inferior temporal lobe and cerebellum; and decreases in the motor and somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe including left amygdala, cingulate cortex, insula and thalamus. Concomitant with these changes, subjects experienced heightened mood, increased extroversion, slight derealization and mild perceptual alterations. MDMA also produced increases in blood pressure and several side effects such as jaw clenching, lack of appetite and difficulty concentrating. These results indicate that a distributed cluster of brain areas underlie the various effects of MDMA in humans."
"684","0","Ketamine treatment for depression: A model of care.^
OBJECTIVE: Ketamine and related compounds are emerging as rapidly acting therapies for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine differs from standard antidepressants in its speed of action, specific acute and cumulative side effects, risk of dependence and regulatory requirements. However, there is currently little guidance offering translation from research studies into clinical practice. We therefore detail a comprehensive model of care for ketamine treatment of depression. METHOD: We formulated a set of policies and procedures for a 'compassionate use' ketamine programme that developed out of our clinical research in ketamine. These policies and procedures were formulated into a detailed model of care. RESULTS: The current Australian and New Zealand regulatory frameworks and professional bodies' recommendations regarding ketamine are detailed along with clinical governance and infrastructure considerations. We next describe a four-step model comprising initial assessment, pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment phases. The model comprises thorough psychiatric and medical assessments examining patient suitability, a rigorous consenting process and structured safety monitoring across an acute treatment course or maintenance therapy. Our ketamine dose-titration method is detailed allowing flexible dosing of patients across a treatment course enabling individualised treatment. CONCLUSION: The model of care aims to bridge the gap between efficacy studies and clinical care outside of research settings as ketamine and related compounds become increasingly important therapies for treatment-resistant depression."

"9613","1","Chronic 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Use Is Related to Glutamate and GABA Concentrations in the Striatum But Not the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.^
Background: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used recreational substance inducing acute release of serotonin. Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-naïve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations. These insights may offer new mechanistic explanations for cognitive deficits (e.g., impaired impulse control) observed in MDMA users."

"6449","1","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^
Ketamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone."
"3408","1","Hyponatraemic states following 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') ingestion.^
Background: Life-threatening and fatal hyponatraemic complications following ecstasy use have previously been documented. Aim: To define clinical features of hyponatraemia following the ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'). Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: All enquiries to the London centre of the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) between December 1993 and March 1996 were screened for cases of MDMA use associated with hyponatraemia (serum sodium <130 mmol/l). History of fluid consumption, presenting features and subsequent clinical course were recorded. Results: Seventeen patients, aged 15-26 years, were identified. Serum sodium levels ranged between 107 mmol/l and 128 mmol/l. In six patients, biochemical results were consistent with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Analytical confirmation of MDMA ingestion was obtained in 10 patients. Ten patients were known to have ingested a large amount of non-alcoholic or alcoholic fluid. The clinical pattern was remarkably uniform, with initial vomiting and disturbed behaviour, followed in 11 patients by seizures. Drowsiness, a mute state and disorientation were observed for up to 3 days. Two patients died; 14 made a complete recovery. Discussion: MDMA can cause life-threatening hyponatraemic encephalopathy when accompanied by excessive fluid ingestion. The mechanism involves inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone."
"4639","1","Acute dose of MDMA (75 mg) impairs spatial memory for location but leaves contextual processing of visuospatial information unaffected.^
RATIONALE: Research concerning spatial memory in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users has presented conflicting results showing either the presence or absence of spatial memory deficits. Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. They were treated with placebo, MDMA 75 mg, and methylphenidate 20 mg. Memory tests were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h (intoxication phase) and between 25.5 and 26 h (withdrawal phase) post-dosing. Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA. Methylphenidate did not affect performance on any of the tasks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a single dose of MDMA impairs spatial memory for location but leaves processing of contextual information intact."
"8248","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during smooth pursuit eye movements.^
The uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

"5925","1","Overcoming blinding confounds in psychedelic randomized controlled trials using biomarker driven causal mediation analysis.^
INTRODUCTION: There is great interest in the use of psychedelic-assisted therapies to treat a range of mental health conditions and initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generated positive results. However, the effect sizes reported in psychedelic RCTs are likely inflated due to expectancy effects due to the de-blinding of both participants and study personnel to treatment allocation caused by the distinctive psychoactive effects of psychedelic drugs. AREAS COVERED: An introduction to causal inference for RCTs, the underlying assumptions, and potential confounders along with graphical illustrations is provided. It is proposed that causal mediation analysis using objectively measured mediating biomarkers could be used to identify causal pathways between treatment and outcome in psychedelic RCTs, even with de-blinding of participants and give greater confidence as to the mechanistic basis and efficacy of psychedelic therapies. EXPERT OPINION: It is argued that psychedelic therapies should not be approved as licensed medicines until causal pathways are clearly established between treatment and outcome. Potential downsides of doing so include, future indication expansion based on low quality clinical trial evidence, the approval of other therapies based on similarly low-quality evidence, and the potential for efficacy to change over time after approvals has been granted."
"6693","1","Acute administration of MDMA influences reward-driven behavior and its underlying neural circuitry.^
Background: The use of MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐Nmethylamphetamine) or “ecstasy” is associated with risk taking behavior, notably high‐risk sexual behavior. However, it is currently unknown whether these behavioral effects of MDMA are a consequence of an increase in risky choices or a change in reward‐driven behavior. To better understand the effects of MDMA on reward‐related decision‐making, as well as the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we modeled risky decision‐making following acute MDMA administration. Methods: Eighteen ecstasy users performed the Rogers' gambling task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after receiving a placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), or high (1.6 mg/kg) dose of MDMA, along with 18 controls, in a double‐blind, mixed between‐within subjects design. The Rogers' task requires participants to choose between variable (“experimental”) and fixed (“control”) gambles, following which they are given feedback regarding their choices. Behavioral analyses were carried out using the R statistical package. The AFNI fMRI package was used to analyze activation at the time of feedback, and also functional connectivity during the Rogers' task. Results: Relative to controls, ecstasy users were more likely to choose the risky option even without MDMA on board. However, acute administration of MDMA did not consistently influence the likelihood of choosing the experimental over control gambles, regardless of the (1) size, (2) probability of winning, or (3) difficulty of making the choice. This suggests that MDMA does not influence risky choices, as measured by the Roger's task. Instead, participants demonstrated an increase in behavioral adaptation to winning ‐ specifically they were less likely to switch following a winning outcome for experimental options, with increasing plasma MDMA concentration. We hypothesized that this change in reward‐driven behavior was either a consequence of a change in reward‐related learning rate, in the positive reward prediction error, or in unexpected uncertainty (stemming from outcomes that violate top‐down expectations). To test these hypotheses, we focused our analysis on regions known to process learning rates (amygdala, cuneus), reward prediction errors (ventral striatum), and unexpected uncertainty (posterior cingulate cortex or PCC, middle temporal cortex, insula, hippocampus). We found a main effect of MDMA on feedback‐related activity within the PCC, hippocampus, and insula, but not in other regions of interest. Critically, a regression analysis revealed that the activity in the PCC explained MDMA effects on win‐switch behavior. Finally, we examined functional connectivity between the PCC and reward ‐ related regions, and found that MDMA administration influences the connectivity between the PCC and the caudate, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that MDMA's influence on risk‐related behavior may be a consequence of a shift in reward‐centered processing of risky options, potentially mediated through its impact on PCC function and connectivity, coupled with pre‐existing differences in risk processing."
"3089","0","Ketamine mechanism of action: Separating the wheat from the chaff.^
This article discusses the mechanism of action of ketamine. Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant effects in severely ill-depressed patients who have failed conventional treatments. This clinical finding has been paradigm-shifting as there is now tremendous hope that very ill-depressed patients can be treated in a matter of hours, rather than many weeks or months required for standard therapies to take effect. However, although the therapeutic potential of ketamine has elicited tremendous excitement in the field, ketamine’s use outside of a monitored clinic setting is limited due to its anesthetic actions at higher doses, abuse liability, ataxic effects, and capacity to produce changes in sensation and dissociation even when administered at sub-anesthetic antidepressant- effective doses. Ketamine’s antidepressant action had been presumed to be via its anesthetic target, which is the inhibition of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized in the liver via multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms to norketamine, dehydronorketamine, hydroxyketamines, and a number of hydroxynorketamines (HNKs) in a stereoselective manner. Validation of the relevance of HNK metabolites to the clinical antidepressant actions of ketamine in humans will require human clinical trials, which are currently in preparation.

"4156","0","Ketamine and nitrous oxide: The evolution of NMDA receptor antagonists as antidepressant agents.^
N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, including ketamine and nitrous oxide, are currently intensely studied as rapid-acting antidepressant agents. Interestingly, both of these compounds are also drugs of abuse. Intravenous ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic that induces complex downstream effects via NMDARs, rapidly reduces depressive and suicidal symptoms in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), as demonstrated by several trials. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an intranasal version of ketamine (esketamine) for TRD. The United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) lists ketamine as a Class III scheduled drug (moderate-low potential for physical and psychological abuse). The FDA has established a Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy (REMS) program to ensure proper drug storage, handling, dispensing, and monitoring intranasal esketamine to minimize misuse/abuse opportunities. Nitrous Oxide is a colorless, odorless, gas that has been in medical use for over 150 years. The mechanisms of action of nitrous oxide are not fully understood; however, it is known to act as a non-competitive inhibitor of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Currently, nitrous oxide is used for inhalational general anesthesia and analgesia for short procedures. Inhaled nitrous oxide is also used recreationally, primarily by teens and young adults, but is not believed to have strong addiction potential. In contrast to ketamine, nitrous oxide is not a controlled substance and can be legally purchased without a prescription. A recent double-blind, prospective, cross-over study demonstrated that nitrous oxide reduced depressive symptoms in a group of severely ill TRD patients. Though this is a promising initial study, further investigation is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7027","0","Structure-Activity Assessment and In-Depth Analysis of Biased Agonism in a Set of Phenylalkylamine 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists.^
Serotonergic psychedelics are described to have activation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) as their main pharmacological action. Despite their relevance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the psychedelic effects induced by certain 5-HT2A agonists remain elusive. One of the proposed hypotheses is the occurrence of biased agonism, defined as the preferential activation of certain signaling pathways over others. This study comparatively monitored the efficiency of a diverse panel of 4-position-substituted (and N-benzyl-derived) phenylalkylamines to induce recruitment of β-arrestin2 (βarr2) or miniGαq to the 5-HT2A, allowing us to assess structure-activity relationships and biased agonism. All test compounds exhibited agonist properties with a relatively large range of both EC50 and Emax values. Interestingly, the lipophilicity of the 2C-X phenethylamines was correlated with their efficacy in both assays but yielded a stronger correlation in the miniGαq- than in the βarr2-assay. Molecular docking suggested that accommodation of the 4-substituent of the 2C-X analogues in a hydrophobic pocket between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 of 5-HT2A may contribute to this differential effect. Aside from previously used standard conditions (lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as a reference agonist and a 2 h activation profile to assess a compound’s activity), serotonin was included as a second reference agonist, and the compounds’ activities were also assessed using the first 30 min of the activation profile. Under all assessed circumstances, the qualitative structure-activity relationships remained unchanged. Furthermore, the use of two reference agonists allowed for the estimation of both “benchmark bias” (relative to LSD) and “physiology bias” (relative to serotonin)."
"4970","1","Acute psychological and physiological effects of MDMA (""Ecstasy"") after haloperidol pretreatment in healthy humans.^
3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") releases serotonin and dopamine. The role for dopamine in mediating the effects of MDMA has not yet been examined in humans. We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the dopamine D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg i.v.) on psychological and physiological responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design. Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales. The physiological effects measured were blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Side effects were assessed during the session, and after 1 and 3 days. Haloperidol attenuated MDMA-induced positive and mania-like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects. Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA. In contrast, dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA, indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine."

AIM: To construct a population pharmacokinetic (popPK) model for ketamine (Ket), norketamine (norKet), dehydronorketamine (DHNK), hydroxynorketamine (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK) and hydroxyketamine (HK) in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. METHOD: Plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, 110, 230 min on day 1, 2 and 3 in nine patients following a 40 min infusion of (R,S)-Ket (0.5 mg kg⁻¹) and analyzed for Ket, norKet and DHNK enantiomers and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK. A compartmental popPK model was constructed that included all quantified analytes, and unknown parameters were estimated with an iterative two-stage algorithm in ADAPT5. RESULTS: Ket, norKet, DHNK and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK were present during the first 230 min post infusion and significant concentrations (>5 ng ml⁻¹) were observed on day 1. Plasma concentrations of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK were below the limit of quantification. The average (S) : (R) plasma concentrations for Ket and DHNK were <1.0 while no significant enantioselectivity was observed for norKet. There were large inter-patient variations in terminal half-lives and relative metabolite concentrations; at 230 min (R,S)-DHNK was the major metabolite in four out of nine patients, (R,S)-norKet in three out of nine patients and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK in two out of nine patients. The final PK model included three compartments for (R,S)-Ket, two compartments for (R,S)-norKet and single compartments for DHNK and HNK. All PK profiles were well described, and parameters for (R,S)-Ket and (R,S)-norKet were in agreement with prior estimates. CONCLUSION: This represents the first PK analysis of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK and (R,S)-DHNK. The results demonstrate that while norKet is the initial metabolite, it is not the main metabolite suggesting that future Ket studies should include the analysis of the major metabolites."
"9114","1","Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.^
Abstract: Rationale: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. Objectives: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. Method: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. Results: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. Conclusions: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
"3786","1","Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination.^
Methylphenidate and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') are widely misused psychoactive drugs. Methylphenidate increases brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels by blocking the presynaptic reuptake transporters. MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine through the same transporters. Pharmacodynamic interactions of methylphenidate and MDMA are likely. This study compared the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination in healthy subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Methylphenidate did not enhance the psychotropic effects of MDMA, although it produced psychostimulant effects on its own. The haemodynamic and adverse effects of co-administration of methylphenidate and MDMA were significantly higher compared with MDMA or methylphenidate alone. Methylphenidate did not change the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and vice versa. Methylphenidate and MDMA shared some subjective amphetamine-type effects; however, 125 mg of MDMA increased positive mood more than 60 mg of methylphenidate, and methylphenidate enhanced activity and concentration more than MDMA. Methylphenidate and MDMA differentially altered facial emotion recognition. Methylphenidate enhanced the recognition of sad and fearful faces, whereas MDMA reduced the recognition of negative emotions. Additionally, the present study found acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to MDMA but not methylphenidate. In conclusion, the combined use of methylphenidate and MDMA does not produce more psychoactive effects compared with either drug alone, but potentially enhances cardiovascular and adverse effects. The findings may be of clinical importance for assessing the risks of combined psychostimulant misuse.

The concepts of intoxication, intoxication psychosis, and drug-induced psychosis are frequently used to refer to psychopathological states caused by the intake of hallucinogenic substances. The considerable increase of intoxications with substances of the chemical class of amphetamines (in particular, ""Ecstasy"") in western countries should cause major concern. Moreover, the number of schizophrenic patients who also use hallucinogenic drugs is increasing. High incidence and comorbidity cause clinical problems and call for detailed knowledge of the drug related acute and chronic effects of the various agents currently in use.

"1230","0","Insights into the neurobiology of suicidality: explicating the role of glutamatergic systems through the lens of ketamine.^
Suicidality is a prevalent mental health condition, and managing suicidal patients is one of the most challenging tasks for health care professionals due to the lack of rapid-acting, effective psychopharmacological treatment options. According to the literature, suicide has neurobiological underpinnings that are not fully understood, and current treatments for suicidal tendencies have considerable limitations. To treat suicidality and prevent suicide, new treatments are required; to achieve this, the neurobiological processes underlying suicidal behavior must be thoroughly investigated. Although multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonergic systems, have been studied in the past, less has been reported in relation to disruptions in glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal plasticity, and neurogenesis that result from stress-related abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Informed by the literature, which reports robust antisuicidal and antidepressive properties of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine, this review aims to provide an examination of the neurobiology of suicidality (and relevant mood disorders) with implications of pertinent animal, clinical, and postmortem studies. We discuss dysfunctions in the glutamatergic system, which may play a role in the neuropathology of suicidality and the role of ketamine in restoring synaptic connectivity at the molecular levels."
"6468","1","Antidepressant effects of a psychedelic experience in a large prospective naturalistic sample.^
BACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, a number of studies have highlighted the potential of psychedelic therapy. However, questions remain to what extend these results translate to naturalistic samples, and how contextual factors and the acute psychedelic experience relate to improvements in affective symptoms following psychedelic experiences outside labs/clinics. The present study sought to address this knowledge gap. AIM: Here, we aimed to investigate changes in anxiety and depression scores before versus after psychedelic experiences in naturalistic contexts, and how various pharmacological, extrapharmacological and experience factors related to outcomes. METHOD: Individuals who planned to undergo a psychedelic experience were enrolled in this online survey study. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks post-psychedelic experience, with self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16) as the primary outcome. To facilitate clinical translation, only participants with depressive symptoms at baseline were included. Sample sizes for the four time points were N = 302, N = 182, N = 155 and N = 109, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, reductions in depressive symptoms were observed at 2 and 4 weeks. A medicinal motive, previous psychedelic use, drug dose and the type of acute psychedelic experience (i.e. specifically, having an emotional breakthrough) were all significantly associated with changes in self-rated QIDS-SR-16. CONCLUSION: These results lend support to therapeutic potential of psychedelics and highlight the influence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors in determining response. Mindful of a potential sample and attrition bias, further controlled and observational longitudinal studies are needed to test the replicability of these findings."
"8298","1","Relationship between ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms and NMDA receptor occupancy: a [(123)I]CNS-1261 SPET study.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine induces effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. These are thought to arise through its action as an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. OBJECTIVES: We used [(123)I]CNS-1261 to study ketamine binding to NMDA receptors in healthy human controls in vivo and its relationship to positive and negative psychotic symptom induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy controls underwent two single-photon emission tomography scans with [(123)I]CNS-1261. On each occasion, they received a bolus infusion of either ketamine or saline. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was administered at the end of each scan. Predefined regions of interest were used to estimate change in volume of distribution of [(123)I]CNS-1261 following ketamine administration. Two normalised-to-cortex binding indices were also used in order to study effects of ketamine on NMDA receptor availability by region, after correction for global and nonspecific effects. RESULTS: Ketamine-induced reduction in [(123)I]CNS-1261 volume of distribution in all regions showed the strongest correlation with BPRS negative subscale (p < 0.01). With the normalised-to-cortex measures, NMDA receptor binding in middle inferior frontal cortex showed a significant correlation with BPRS negative subscale (BI1 r = 0.88, BI2 r = 95.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: [(123)I]CNS-1261 binding was modulated by ketamine, a drug known to compete for the same site on the NMDA receptor in vitro. Ketamine may induce negative symptoms through direct inhibition of the NMDA receptor, and positive symptoms may arise through a different neurochemical pathway."

This study examines the plasma pharmacokinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and metabolites 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) in young adults for up to 143 hours after drug administration. Seventeen female and male participants (black, white, and Hispanic) received placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses (comparable to recreational doses) in a double-blind, randomized, balanced, within-subject design while residing on a closed research unit. Doses were separated by 1 week or more. A fully validated two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method simultaneously quantified MDMA, HMMA, MDA, and HMA. Calibration curves were MDA, 1 to 100 ng/mL; HMA, 2.5 to 100 ng/mL; and MDMA and HMMA, 2.5 to 400 ng/mL. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) of 162.9 +/- 39.8 and 171.9 +/- 79.5 ng/mL were observed for MDMA and HMMA, respectively, after low-dose MDMA. After the high dose, mean MDMA Cmax significantly increased to 291.8 +/- 76.5 ng/mL, whereas mean HMMA C(max) was unchanged at 173.5 +/- 66.3 ng/mL. High intersubject variability in C(max) was observed. Mean MDA C(max) were 8.4 +/- 2.1 (low) and 13.8 +/- 3.8 (high) ng/mL. HMA Cmax were 3.5 +/- 0.4 and 3.9 +/- 0.9 ng/mL after the low and high doses, respectively. AUC infinity displayed similar trends to C(max), demonstrating nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Times of last plasma detection were generally HMA < MDA < MDMA < HMMA. Mean half-lives (t1/2) of MDMA, MDA, and HMMA were approximately 7 to 8 hours, 10.5 to 12.5 hours, and 11.5 to 13.5 hours, respectively. HMA t1/2 showed high variability. Mean MDMA volume of distribution was constant for low and high doses; clearance was significantly higher after the low dose. This study presents MDMA plasma pharmacokinetic data for the first time from blacks and females as well as measurement of HMMA and HMA concentrations after low and high MDMA doses and more frequent and extended plasma sampling than in prior studies."

Incorporation rates of the enantiomers of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) into hair and nails were investigated after controlled administration. Fifteen subjects without MDMA use received two doses of 125 mg of MDMA. Hair, nail scrapings, and nail clippings were collected 9-77 days after the last administration (median 20 days). Hair samples were analyzed in segments of 1- to 2-cm length. After chiral derivatization with N-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-L-valinamide, MDMA and MDA diastereomers were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Highest concentrations in hair segments corresponded to the time of MDMA intake. They ranged from 101 to 3200 pg/mg and 71 to 860 pg/mg for R- and S-MDMA, and from 3.2 to 116 pg/mg and 4.4 to 108 pg/mg for R- and S-MDA, respectively. MDMA and MDA concentrations in nail scrapings and clippings were significantly lower than in hair samples. There was no significant difference between enantiomeric ratios of R/S-MDMA and R/S-MDA in hair and nail samples (medians 2.2-2.4 for MDMA and 0.85-0.95 for MDA). Metabolite ratios of MDA to MDMA were in the same range in hair and nail samples (medians 0.044-0.055). Our study demonstrates that administration of two representative doses of MDMA was detected in the hair segments corresponding to the time of intake based on average hair growth rates. MDMA was detected in all nail samples regardless of time passed after intake. Comparable R/S ratios in hair and nail samples may indicate that incorporation mechanisms into both matrices are comparable."

Objective To systematically review published research studies and ongoing clinical trials investigating nitrous oxide (N2O) in psychiatric disorders, providing an up-to-date snapshot of the clinical research landscape. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published until June 2021 using the OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo) and the clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Results In total, five relevant published articles were identified, among which four investigated N2O for depression. One single-dose randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), one triple crossover RCT comparing 50% vs. 25% N2O for TRD, and one repeated-dose RCT for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that N2O has preliminary feasibility with rapid-acting effects on symptoms of depression. From the public registries, 10 relevant ongoing clinical trials were identified. They aim to explore the use of N2O for MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. To date, the typical treatment protocol parameters were a single session of 50% N2O delivered for 60 min, although the concentration of 25% is also being explored. Projected enrolment numbers for ongoing trials (M = 55.0) were much higher than sample sizes for published studies (M = 13.0), suggesting that there potentially will be more large-scale RCTs published in the next few years. Conclusion Preliminary studies support the feasibility of administering N2O for depression; however, appropriate blinding is a critical challenge. Larger-scale RCTs with repeated doses of N2O and follow-up times beyond 1 month are needed to confirm the feasibility, therapeutic efficacy, and sustainability of response."

MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine; commonly referred to as “Molly” or “ecstasy”) is a synthetic compound, structurally and pharmacologically similar to both amphetamines and mescaline. MDMA differs somewhat from traditional amphetamines in that it is not structurally similar to serotonin. Cocaine is rare and cannabis is consumed less frequently than in Western Europe. Heroin is the drug of choice for the poor in Bucharest, Romania’s capital of two million people, and alcoholism is common in villages where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. By far, the most popular drugs are Legal Highs (Romanians call them “ethnobotanics”). All of these drugs have significant effects on cardiovascular function that contribute significantly to adverse events. Most adverse cardiac events occur in young adults and are potentially reversible. Poisoning among patients aged 17 years and over was commonly seen in the Emergency Departments of a large tertiary hospital in the city centre, accounting for 3.2% of all patients. In a third of the poisonings, more than one substance was used. Intoxication with ethnobotanicals was the most frequently observed, followed by use of drugs from the amphetamine group. The majority of patients presenting to the Emergency Department were male. Therefore, this study suggests further research on hazardous alcohol consumption and drug abuse."

RATIONALE: Depressed patients robustly exhibit affective biases in emotional processing which are altered by SSRIs and predict clinical outcome. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients' emotional processing biases. METHODS: Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin. RESULTS: We found evidence for a group × time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p < .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin with psychological support appears to improve processing of emotional faces in treatment-resistant depression, and this correlates with reduced anhedonia. Placebo-controlled studies are warranted to follow up these preliminary findings."
"1882","1","Acute cognitive effects of single-dose intravenous ketamine in major depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder.^
Intravenous (IV) subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been shown to reduce psychiatric distress in both major depressive (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effect of ketamine on cognitive function in these disorders is not well understood. To address this gap, we examined the effect of a single dose of IV ketamine on cognition in individuals with MDD and/or PTSD relative to healthy controls (HC). Psychiatric (n = 29; 15 PTSD, 14 MDD) and sex- age- and IQ matched HC (n = 29) groups were recruited from the community. A single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine was administered. Mood and cognitive measures were collected prior to, 2 h and 1 day post-ketamine administration. MDD/PTSD individuals evidenced a large-magnitude improvement in severity of depressive symptoms at both 2-hours and 1 day post-ketamine administration (p’s <.001, Cohen d’s = 0.80–1.02). Controlling for baseline performance and years of education, IV ketamine induced declines in attention (ATTN), executive function (EF), and verbal memory (VM) 2 h post-administration, all of which had resolved by 1 day post-ketamine across groups. The magnitude of cognitive decline was significantly larger in MDD/PTSD relative to HC on attention only (p =.012, d = 0.56). Ketamine did not affect working memory (WM) performance. Cognitive function (baseline, change from baseline to post-ketamine) was not associated with antidepressant response to ketamine. Results suggest that while ketamine may have an acute deleterious effect on some cognitive domains in both MDD/PTSD and HC individuals, most notably attention, this reduction is transient and there is no evidence of ketamine-related cognitive dysfunction at 1 day post-administration."

All psychotherapy associated with the intervention will be administered face‐to‐face by a trained co‐therapist dyad consisting of one medically‐trained health professional (psychiatrist, psychiatry registrar, GP, or physician) and one psychologist. Psychotherapy will involve 2 Preparatory Sessions prior to Dose Session 1, at which time participants will be provided with information relating to psilocybin and its psychotropic effects. Supportive psychotherapy provided on‐site during Dose Sessions will consist of non‐directive psychological support within the context of a largely non‐interventional approach. Each Dose Session will be followed by 3 Integration Sessions, during which participants will be invited to discuss their experience during the Dose Session, and engage in analysis and meaning‐making to consolidate any therapeutic outcomes accrued during the experience.

The comorbidity of psychotic disorders and substance misuse disorder (SUD) is a well known and documented phenomenon. The aim of the present study was to find an answer to the question whether among the known Hungarian drug addicts how severe are the occurrence of the psychotic symptoms. The study sample consisted 194 out of 200 clinically treated drug addicts. The instruments used for the investigation were the European Adolescent Assessment Dialogue (Euro ADAD) and the Symptom Checklist 90 Revised (SCL 90-R). The most important findings suggest that the clinically relevant psychotic states were quite rare. The highest values of PSY subscale were associated with dependent people on the ""other drugs"" (hallucinogens, solvents), cocaine, alcohol and heroin. The correlation between the values of the subscale and the usage of the ambulant or hospital form of mental health care was not too strong, yet significant."
"7619","0","Lanicemine: a low-trapping NMDA channel blocker produces sustained antidepressant efficacy with minimal psychotomimetic adverse effects.^
Ketamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channel blocker, has been found to induce rapid and robust antidepressant‐like effects in rodent models and in treatment‐refractory depressed patients. However, the marked acute psychological side effects of ketamine complicate the interpretation of both preclinical and clinical data. Moreover, the lack of controlled data demonstrating the ability of ketamine to sustain the antidepressant response with repeated administration leaves the potential clinical utility of this class of drugs in question. Using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to objectively align doses of a low‐trapping NMDA channel blocker, AZD6765 (lanicemine), to that of ketamine, we demonstrate the potential for NMDA channel blockers to produce antidepressant efficacy without psychotomimetic and dissociative side effects. Furthermore, using placebo‐controlled data, we show that the antidepressant response to NMDA channel blockers can be maintained with repeated and intermittent drug administration. Together, these data provide a path for the development of novel glutamatergic‐based therapeutics for treatment‐refractory mood disorders."

RATIONALE: With alcohol and cannabis remaining the most commonly detected drugs in seriously and fatally injured drivers, there is a need to understand their combined effects on driving. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the effects of combinations of smoked cannabis (12.5% THC) and alcohol (target BrAC 0.08%) on simulated driving performance, subjective drug effects, cardiovascular measures, and self-reported perception of driving ability. METHODS: In this within-subjects, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, cannabis users (1-7 days/week) aged 19-29 years attended four drug administration sessions in which simulated driving, subjective effects, cardiovascular measures, and whole blood THC and metabolite concentrations were assessed following placebo alcohol and placebo cannabis (<0.1% THC), alcohol and placebo cannabis, placebo alcohol and active cannabis, and alcohol and active cannabis. RESULTS: Standard deviation of lateral position in the combined condition was significantly different from the placebo condition (p < 0.001). Standard deviation of lateral position was also significantly different from alcohol and cannabis alone conditions in the single task overall drive (p = 0.029 and p = 0.032, respectively), from the alcohol alone condition in the dual task overall drive (p = 0.022) and the cannabis alone condition in the dual task straightaway drive (p = 0.002). Compared to the placebo condition, the combined and alcohol conditions significantly increased reaction time. Subjective effects in the combined condition were significantly greater than with either of the drugs alone at some time points, particularly later in the session. A driving ability questionnaire showed that participants seemed unaware of their level of impairment. CONCLUSION: Combinations of alcohol and cannabis increased weaving and reaction time, and tended to produce greater subjective effects compared to placebo and the single drug conditions suggesting a potential additive effect. The fact that participants were unaware of this increased effect has important implications for driving safety."

Techniques of total intravenous anaesthesia with ketamine and continuous epidural block are compared with the conventional method of using halothane, nitrous oxide and relaxant. Both ketamine and epidural techniques were associated with minimal cardiovascular disturbances, low blood loss and better quality of anaesthesia and recovery scores. The usual psychomimetic effect associated with ketamine administration was observed in only one patient. Further experience of total intravenous ketamine anaesthesia with adjunctive use of fentanyl to attenuate cardiovascular effects and midazolam for the pyschomimetic effect can further refine the technique. Cerebral function monitoring, if possible, will allow correlation of depth of anaesthesia with drug dosage and can ensure appropriate anaesthetic depth and recovery."

Human MDMA (R,S-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users display selective cognitive deficits after acute MDMA exposure, frequently attributed to serotonin deficits. We postulated that MDMA will compromize executive function in primates and that an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) but not the dopamine (DAT) transporter, will prevent impairment. The potencies of DAT/NET, NET and SERT inhibitors to block transport of [3H]MDMA and [3H]monoamines were compared in vitro. Subsequently, cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis) were trained to stable performance in a reversal learning task. Effects of once-weekly oral or i.m. dose of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg, n = 4) on performance were monitored, alone or after pretreatment with inhibitors of the SERT, DAT or NET (prior to i.m. MDMA). 1) Drug potencies for blocking [3H]MDMA or [3H]monoamine transport were not consistent; 2) Oral MDMA increased error rates in a cognitive task for up to three days following exposure, whereas intramuscular MDMA prevented subjects from performing the cognitive task on the day of administration, but not on subsequent days; 3) The SERT inhibitor citalopram and the NET inhibitor desipramine, but not the DAT/NET inhibitor methylphenidate, reversed the effects of MDMA on task performance and mandibular movements induced by i.m. MDMA and 4) MDMA altered sleep latency. Oral MDMA impairs executive function in monkeys for several days, a finding of potential relevance to MDMA consumption by humans. Reversal of impaired executive function by a NET inhibitor implicates the NET and norepinephrine in MDMA-induced cognitive impairment and may be relevant to therapeutic strategies. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"6040","1","Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in 12 Subjects With PTSD.^
Post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that can develop after people experience a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but these treatments do not help everyone. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD. This is a Phase 2 randomized, dose comparison, double‐blind study to assess safety and efficacy of manualized MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in treating chronic, treatment‐resistant PTSD. Seven subjects will be randomized to receive full dose MDMA (full dose condition) and five subjects will receive a comparator (comparator condition), with an optional supplemental half‐dose available 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Global Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score one month after two sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is the primary outcome measure. MDMA or comparator will be administered in two blinded experimental sessions lasting up to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart. The will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months of psychotherapy, and a long‐term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final experimental session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to assess eligibility for enrollment. Once in the study, they will see the same male and female psychotherapist for the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the investigators will learn more about the subject during three preparatory sessions occurring before the first experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will receive an initial dose of either full dose MDMA or placebo along with psychotherapy, and one and a half to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a supplemental half the size of the initial dose. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. There will be three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, including one occurring the day after an experimental session. Subjects will express, understand and connect any of their thoughts or feelings about PTSD symptoms and their causes, and they will discuss their experience during experimental sessions with the therapists. Subjects will learn the dose of MDMA they received one month after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session. Subjects who received full dose will complete Stage 1, with a third open‐label session, and subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will go on to Stage 2, an open label period of the study that is nearly identical to stage 1, but with one instead of three preparatory sessions and one of two active doses of MDMA used in all three experimental sessions. This study will compare the effects of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus full dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, dissociation, general psychological well‐being, sleep quality and potential positive effects of experiencing traumatic events will be measured in all subjects at baseline, one month after the second experimental session and 12 months after their final experimental session, and any subjects reporting pain or tinnitus at the start of the study will record these symptoms throughout the study.Subjects who received the full dose and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of PTSD and other symptoms two months after the third experimental session. Subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session and two months after the third experimental session. Measures of cognitive function will be given to subjects in Stage two months after their third experimental session, and to Stage 2 subjects two months after their third Stage 2 session. People will also complete measures of their experience of the experimental session soon after each experimental session. At least 12 months after their final Stage 1 or Stage 2 session, measures of PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, sleep quality, general well‐being and and post traumatic growth will be assessed again, and subjects will complete a questionnaire on the benefits and harms of study participation and other life events and views related to study participation."
"2736","1","Reduction of psychotomimetic side effects of Ketalar (ketamine) by Rohypnol (flunitrazepam). A randomized, double-blind trial.^
A double-blind controlled trial based on 140 women undergoing abortus provocatus was employed to study whether the frequency of side effects after administration of the anaesthetic Ketalar (ketamine) could be reduced by a con-current dose of Rohypnol (flunitrazepam). The control group was given ketamine alone. The dosage of ketamine was 2 mg/kg body weight, supplemented if necessary by 1 mg/kg, in combination with either 2 mg flunitrazepam or placebo. No other anaesthetics were used. On several counts, the combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam was proved to reduce the adverse reactions seen with ketamine alone. Motor restlessness and confusion in the awakening state occurred with significantly less severity and frequency. Amnesia for dreams was significantly more frequent. Memory of dreams was often unpleasant after ketamine alone. The influence on pulse rate was significantly smaller and no significant changes in systolic blood pressure were seen, whereas a significant increase occurred with ketamine alone. Less pronounced fluctuations in diastolic blood pressure occurred with the combination ketamine-flunitrazepam. Respiratory rate increased significantly with both treatments, but respiratory minute volume was lower with the ketamine-flunitrazepam combination. A double-blind comparison of ketamine (Ketalar) and ketamine with flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) for anesthesia in 136 abortions was conducted to see whether the combination would reduce the psychomimetic side effects of ketamine. Doses were ketamine 2 mg/kg body weight iv, mixed with 2 mg flunitrazepam or a placebo, and 1 mg/kg ketamine repeated if needed. The side effects significantly reduced were: motor restlessness, confusion requiring sedatives, dreams and nightmares, systolic and diastolic hypertension, tachycardia, and increase in respiratory rate and in respiratory minute volume. Those given ketamine alone required significantly more repeat injections. eng"
"8910","1","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^
RATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both."
"7357","1","Perception of heading in abstinent MDMA and THC users.^
Purpose: Assess residual effects of MDMA (Ecstasy) and THC (marijuana) on perceived trajectory of travel. Methods: 42 licensed drivers (ages 21-42) participated: 12 MDMA/THC users, 15 THC users and 15 non-drug users. Drug use besides MDMA/THC was similar in both drug groups. There were no age, acuity (Sloane) or contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) differences between groups. Perception of self-motion, or heading, from optical flow patterns was tested with stimuli comprising random dot ground planes presented at 3 densities (.035, .243 and .451 dots/ square degree) and 8 heading angles (1,2, 4 and 8 deg to the left or right). On each trial, subjects reported if direction of travel was to the left or the right relative to a vertical post whose position varied with respect to body midline (Warren et al., 1989). Right and left heading angles were combined into one score, as we expected no lateralized performance difference. Dependent measure was % correct. Results: Performance in all groups improved as heading angle increased; density had little effect. Plots of % correct vs. degrees of heading angle showed worse performance in both drug groups compared to controls at all but the 8 deg heading angle (P<0.05). The MDMA/THC group performed worst, especially at lower heading angles. Conclusions: Psychoactive agents appear to adversely affect visual perception, even in recently abstinent users, and appear to be additive in MDMA and THC. Precise mechanisms are unknown, but may involve serotonin and acetylcholine receptors in visual pathways. Residual effects may impair performance on driving-related tasks."

Low-frequency (<4 Hz) neural activity, particularly in the delta band, is generally indicative of loss of consciousness and cortical down states, particularly when it is diffuse and high amplitude. Remarkably, however, drug challenge studies of several diverse classes of pharmacological agents-including drugs which treat epilepsy, activate GABA(B) receptors, block acetylcholine receptors, or produce psychedelic effects-demonstrate neural activity resembling cortical down states even as the participants remain conscious. Of those substances that are safe to use in healthy volunteers, some may be highly valuable research tools for investigating which neural activity patterns are sufficient for consciousness or its absence."

Introduction: Many international studies show that religion is an important dimension modulating the use of alcohol and drugs by adolescents. Objectives: to determine which religious variables are associated to frequent or heavy use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs among adolescents in intermediate and high schools in Campinas, Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-report anonymous questionnaire was administered to 2.287 students from a convenience sample of seven schools: five from central areas (two public and three private schools) and two public schools from the outskirts of the city, in 1998. The study analyzes data regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, medicines, solvents, marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy. The religious variables included in the regression analysis were: religious affiliation, church attendance, self-assessed religiousness, and religious education in childhood. For the substances, nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and ""abuse of medicines"" a logistic regression analysis for dicotomic answer was applied. Results: The heavy use of at least one drug during the last month was more frequent among students that did not have a religious education during childhood. The use in the last month of cocaine, ecstasy and (abuse of) medicines was more frequent among those students that had no religion (cocaine and medicines) and that did not have a religious education during childhood (ecstasy and medicines). Conclusions: this study is consistent with previous investigations demonstrating a strong influence of religious variables over the use of drugs among adolescents. Interesting, it was found that no or weaker religious education during childhood was markedly associated with significant more use of drugs during adolescence."
"9579","1","Acute effects of ketamine and esketamine on cognition in healthy subjects: A meta-analysis.^
BACKGROUND: Impairment in cognition is frequently associated with acute ketamine administration. However, some questions remain unanswered as to which deficits are most prominent and what variables modulate these effects. METHODS: A literature search yielded 56 experimental studies of acute ketamine administration that assessed cognition in 1041 healthy volunteers. A multivariate meta-analysis was performed, and effect sizes were estimated for eleven cognitive domains: attention, executive function, response inhibition, social cognition, speed of processing, verbal / language, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning & memory, visuospatial abilities, and working memory. RESULTS: There were small-to-moderate impairments across all cognitive domains. Deficits in verbal learning / memory were most prominent, whereas response inhibition was the least affected. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the negative effects of ketamine on cognition are dependent on infusion dose and plasma level, but unaffected by enantiomer type, route of administration, sex or age. A publication bias was observed. DISCUSSION: Acute ketamine broadly impairs cognition across all domains among healthy individuals. Verbal learning and memory figures most prominently in cognitive impairment elicited by acute ketamine administration."

A survey of magic mushroom use was completed by 174 participants in 2004, a year when the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms was not illegal in the UK. The data were collected in Edinburgh and Bristol (UK). Participants were a self-selecting convenience sample. Participants tended to be in their 20s, White-British, in education or employed; 64% were male. Participants reported a pattern of infrequent but intense consumption (47% used between 4-12 times/year, average consumption in one setting was 12 g, a high dose). Use was explained in terms of laughing, hallucinations, altering perspective (41-74%), and feelings of being closer to nature (49%). Negative experiences reported included paranoia (35%) and anxiety (32%). Mushroom use was located within a wider recreational drug and alcohol culture. Four focus groups aided the interpretation of the data. Future research is recommended into negative experiences. Implications for policy and harm minimisation literature are discussed.

"6986","1","A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics.^
The phenomenon of 'microdosing', that is, regular ingestion of very small quantities of psychedelic substances, has seen a rapid explosion of popularity in recent years. Individuals who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a systematic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naïve and experienced microdosers, so as to gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers. Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed."
"8678","1","The epidemiology of mescaline use: Pattern of use, motivations for consumption, and perceived consequences, benefits, and acute and enduring subjective effects.^
Background: Mescaline is a naturally occurring psychoactive phenethylamine found in several cacti and historically used ceremonially by Indigenous and Latin American populations. Broader recognition of its possible therapeutic value in Western science began in the 1950s; however, knowledge of the safety profile of mescaline and the extent of its use remains limited. The primary aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of mescaline use among English-speaking adults. Methods: About 452 respondents completed a web-based survey designed to assess their previous experience with mescaline (subjective effects, outcome measures, and mescaline type used). Results: Most respondents reported that they had consumed mescaline infrequently (⩽once/year), for spiritual exploration or to connect with nature (74%). A small number of respondents reported drug craving/desire (9%), whereas very few reported legal (1%), or psychological problems (1%) related to its use, and none reported seeking any medical attention. Overall, respondents rated the acute mystical-type effects as “moderate,” ego-dissolution and psychological insight effects as “slight,” and challenging effects as “very slight.” Most respondents reported that they used Peyote and San Pedro in their most memorable mescaline experience. Overall, the intensity of acute mescaline effects did not differ between mescaline types. About 50% of the sample reported having a psychiatric condition (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc.), and most (>67%) reported improvements in these conditions following their most memorable experience with mescaline. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the mescaline in any form may produce a psychedelic experience that is associated with the spiritual significance and improvements in the mental health with low potential for abuse."

Introduction: Texas has approximately 200 species of wild mushrooms, including toxic and hallucinogenic varieties. Mushroom ingestions in Texas were studied for 2005-2006. Methods: Data was obtained via Texas Poison Control Centers and retrospectively reviewed. Case notes were reviewed individually regarding initial reporting, age, signs and symptoms, toxic effect, management, and patient outcomes. Results: A total of 742 exposures occurred during the study period. All exposures were acute and intentional. Of these exposures, 59 (7.9%) were admitted to the hospital, with 17 (28.8% of admissions) requiring admission to a critical care unit. Four cases required inpatient psychiatric admission. The average age of admitted exposures was 20.5 years, with a male-to-female predominance of 3.3:1. Eleven (22.9%) of the admitted exposures were identified, with Psilocybin being the most common agent (n = 10, 91%). Among the admissions, co-ingestions were identified with the mushroom ingestion in eleven patients (40.7%). The most common symptoms in admitted patients were vomiting (n = 34, 57.6%), nausea (n = 19, 32.2%), altered mental status (n = 17, 28.8%), abdominal pain (n = 13, 22%), and diarrhea (n = 10, 16.9%). Conclusions: All mushroom exposures examined were acute and intentional. Major toxic reactions were uncommon, and no deaths were reported. Serious poisoning from mushroom ingestion is rare in Texas; however, there is greater need for information dissemination on morbidity."
"9610","0","Analysis of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy in Medicine: A Narrative Review.^
Psilocybin-containing mushrooms have been consumed by various cultures in many different parts of the world for thousands of years. Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic, contains unique psychoactive properties and has been incorporated into religious ceremonies and investigated for its medicinal value. In the mid-20th century, psilocybin, along with most other classic psychedelics (5HT-2A agonists), was classified as a Schedule I substance, bringing a halt to research on its medicinal utility. The resurgence of clinical trials involving psilocybin in the 21st century has produced promising results concerning the treatment of addiction, depression, and end-of-life mood disorders. Results from these trials have shown significant reductions in depression and anxiety when compared with a placebo, and one trial found no significant difference when compared to a routinely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Studies conducted with patients with advanced-stage cancer have demonstrated that psilocybin may also be beneficial at reducing depression and anxiety associated with psychological crises due to a terminal diagnosis. Psilocybin therapy in the treatment of addiction, which is notoriously difficult to treat, has shown encouraging results. Due to its low toxicity and low risk of overuse, psilocybin has the potential to have a significant influence in the field of addiction medicine. Psilocybin addiction research has been primarily focused on nicotine and alcohol and, in a few small, open-label trials, has shown superiority over traditional therapies. Psilocybin has a relatively unique and incompletely understood mechanism of action, which allows it to be given at several isolated periods. This infrequent dosing regimen has been shown to produce durable effects with minimal toxicity. This review analyzes the potential of psilocybin in the treatment of addiction, depression, and end-of-life mood disorders. In addition, it will discuss the difficulties involved with conducting scientific research on psychedelic compounds, adverse effects, and the therapeutic measures that are necessary to accompany the safe and effective administration of these psychoactive chemicals."
"1291","1","Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: a preliminary positron emission tomography study.^
BACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence support a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, rapidly improves depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 20 unmedicated participants with treatment-resistant MDD underwent positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and following ketamine infusion (single dose of .5mg/kg intravenous over 40minutes). Metabolic data were compared between conditions using a combination of region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses, and differences were correlated with the associated antidepressant response. RESULTS: Whole-brain metabolism did not change significantly following ketamine. Regional metabolism decreased significantly under ketamine in the habenula, insula, and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the right hemisphere. Metabolism increased postketamine in bilateral occipital, right sensorimotor, left parahippocampal, and left inferior parietal cortices. Improvement in depression ratings correlated directly with change in metabolism in right superior and middle temporal gyri. Conversely, clinical improvement correlated inversely with metabolic changes in right parahippocampal gyrus and temporoparietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these results indicate that treatment-resistant MDD subjects showed decreased metabolism in the right habenula and the extended medial and orbital prefrontal networks in association with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine. Conversely, metabolism increased in sensory association cortices, conceivably related to the illusory phenomena sometimes experienced with ketamine. Further studies are needed to elucidate how these functional anatomical changes relate to the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."
"9244","1","Ketamine-induced changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the resting-state functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex.^
OBJECTIVES: Synaptic plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling are proposed to play key roles in antidepressant drug action. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). METHODS: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. RESULTS: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate BDNF level dynamics following ketamine are related to acute and 24 h RSFC changes. Particularly when BDNF increases are observed after ketamine infusion, a disconnection from dmPFC after 24 h is seen and may reflect synaptic plasticity effects."

Cancer is highly prevalent and one of the leading causes of global morbidity and mortality. Psychological and existential suffering is common in cancer patients, associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Promising early-phase clinical research (1960s to early 1970s) suggested a therapeutic signal for serotoninergic psychedelics (e.g. psilocybin, LSD) in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress. After several decades of quiescence, research on psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat psychiatric disorders in cancer patients has resumed within the last 2 decades in the US and Europe. This review article is based on a systematic search of clinical trials from 1960-2018 researching the therapeutic use of psychedelic treatment in patients with serious or terminal illnesses and related psychiatric illness. The search found 10 eligible clinical trials, with a total of 445 participants, with the vast majority of the patients having advanced or terminal cancer diagnoses. Six open label trials, published between 1964 and 1980 (n = 341), suggested that psychedelic therapy (mostly with LSD) may improve cancer-related depression, anxiety, and fear of death. Four RCTs trials were published between 2011 and 2016 (n = 104), mostly with psilocybin treatment (n = 92), and demonstrated that psychedelic-assisted treatment can produce rapid, robust, and sustained improvements in cancer-related psychological and existential distress."
"8781","0","Successful outcomes with low-threshold intervention for cannabis use disorders in Norway - an observational study.^
AIMS: Cannabis is the most commonly used regulated drug by European youths. Yet, few cannabis-specific interventions have been examined in Europe. The Cannabis Cessation Program (CCP) was developed in Sweden in the 1990s and has been implemented in some Norwegian municipalities. The present study aimed to examine outcomes of this intervention in the Norwegian setting. METHOD: The respondents (N = 102) were recruited in four community-based CCPs in Norway. We examined their changes in cannabis use, other substance use, mental distress, well-being, sense of coherence (SoC), and social networks, from baseline (T0) to post-treatment (T1) and up to a 3-month follow-up period (T2). Changes were evaluated with pair-wise t-tests. RESULT: Seventy-six participants (75%) completed the 8-week program, according to plan. All participants reported a significant reduction in cannabis use at T1 (average reduction ~16 days per month) and at T2 (N = 59; ~13 days per month). Among those that completed the program, 67% was abstinent from cannabis at T1 and 37% was abstinent at T2. An intention-to-treat analysis showed that 50% (51/102) and 22% (22/102) were abstinent from cannabis use at T1 and T2, respectively. In parallel to abstinence, we observed a substantial reduction in mental distress and an increase in well-being and SoC. Respondents socialized with fewer friends with current substance use, but drug-free social networks were not expanded. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the CCP was a valuable, low-threshold manual-based intervention for cannabis use disorders. It showed considerable potential for reducing individuals' cannabis use. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov no. NCT04989205. Registered 12 July 2021, i.e., the study was retrospectively registered."
"647","1","Patterns of simultaneous polysubstance use in Canadian rave attendees.^
The aim of this study was to examine rave-related polydrug drug use and to determine if patterns of substance use were associated with previous rave attendance. One hundred and eighty-six rave attendees (50% female) representing a wide range of ages (16 to 47 years; mean = 23.5, sd = 5.15) and levels of rave attendance experience (1 to 400 events) completed structured interviews in Montreal, Canada between November 2002 and September 2003 about their rave attendance patterns and their use of various licit and illicit substances at the most recently attended event. On average, participants reported using 2.5 different psychoactive substances (excluding tobacco) at the most recent event attended. Cannabis, alcohol, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine, and GHB were the most frequently reported substances, and details about their orders of administration, dosages, and patterns of co-administration are presented and discussed. The total lifetime number of raves attended by participants varied considerably (mean = 48.6; sd = 69.7; median = 25), and there was a positive correlation between the number events attended and number of substances used at the most recent event attended (p < 0.001). Analyses revealed that individuals reporting the use of ketamine, GHB, and/or cocaine at the most recent event had attended significantly more events than nonusers even when controlling for various demographic variables. A subset of respondents (n = 27) completed a second interview to determine the reliability of their responses. Results indicated that respondents could reliably recall details about which drugs were used, the total doses administered, as well as order of drug administration.

"3451","1","Neurocognitive performance under combined regimens of ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-fentanyl in healthy adults: A randomised trial.^
Analgesic doses of ketamine affects neurocognition; however, deficits under co-administration regimens are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of ketamine, alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or fentanyl on neurocognition. Using a randomised, within-subjects gender stratified design, 39 participants (mean age = 28.4, SD ± 5.8) received a ketamine bolus of 0.3 mg/kg followed by 0.15 mg/kg/h infusion of ketamine (3 h duration). At 1.5 h post-ketamine infusion commencement, participants received either: i) 0.7 μg/kg/h infusion of dexmedetomidine (n = 19) (KET/DEX) or (ii) three 25 μg fentanyl injections over 1.5 h (n = 20) (KET/FENT). Reaction and Movement time (RTI, Simple and 5Choice), Visuospatial Working Memory (SWM) and Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Whole blood drug concentrations were determined during ketamine-only infusion, at co-administration (KET/DEX or KET/FENT) and at 2-h post-treatment. Ketamine-only administration impaired psychomotor response speed (Simple and 5Choice) and impaired memory (all p < .001), however did not alter executive function abilities. Independent of sedation, co-administration of dexmedetomidine produced synergistic performance and memory deficits which persisted at post-treatment (KET/DEX) (all p < .001), and were comparatively greater than for KET/FENT (all p < .05). Ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine concentrations were modestly associated with reduced psychomotor speed and accuracy (all p < .05), and an inverse relationship was found between blood concentrations of ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine and performance on memory tasks. Co-administration of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not with fentanyl exerts synergistic effects on psychomotor performance and memory without executive dysfunction. Assessment of these effects in clinical groups is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"2182","0","Recreational drug use: a major risk factor for gastroschisis?.^
The authors tested the hypothesis that the birth prevalence of gastroschisis is positively associated with use of recreational drugs in early pregnancy. A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003. For each case, three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery, region, and maternal age. Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios. Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis. Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1) any recreational drug (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 4.3) and 2) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs (defined as cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy) (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.5). Other significant exposures included aspirin use (OR = 20.4, 95% CI: 2.2, 191.5), cigarette smoking (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6), and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.6). Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking, aspirin use, and history of gynecologic infection/disease. Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use."
"6499","0","Relationship between physical findings and related subjective symptoms in neuropsychiatric patients with somatic complications. With special reference to ophthalmologic observations.^
The relationship between physical signs and subjective symptoms was examined on ophthalmological abnormalities in 306 neuropsychiatric inpatients, mainly in schizophrenics. The average duration of disease was 11.3 yr and chronic cases were prominent. Control cases were 89 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Spontaneous complaints of the eye were made in 4 of the 306 cases. At ophthalmological examination a variety of abnormal findings were revealed in 268 cases (87.6%). This fact proved that neuropsychiatric patients complained rarely as compared with the rate of abnormal findings. As a result of clinical interview using a definite questionnaire, subjective symptoms were found in 154 (50.3%), being significantly lower than 69 (77.5%) in tuberculosis patients (p<0.05). Accordance between subjective symptoms and abnormal findings was found more often in cases of tuberculosis than in cases of neuropsychiatric patients (p<0.005). Among cases showing discordance, absence of subjective symptoms in spite of presence of abnormal findings, was observed more frequently in neuropsychiatric patients (p<0.005), especially in schizophrenics with highly advanced emotional disorder. Abnormal findings which were apt to be accompanied with no subjective symptoms were disorders of visual acuity, and opacities of the cornea and the lens. Existence of subjective symptoms without any abnormal findings was more remarkable in the tuberculosis patients (p<0.005) than in the neuropsychiatric patients. In the study of the relation between absence of subjective symptoms and administered psychotropic drugs, the amount of drugs administered during the day of ophthalmological examination, the period from the beginning of therapy to the examination (whole administration period), the total amount of psychotropic drugs and others were calculated. Cases having no subjective symptoms in spite of presence of abnormal findings presented higher levels of drug dosage and also longer periods in the whole term than cases having subjective symptoms corresponding to abnormal findings, but there was no significant difference. Comments were made on the results described above, emphasizing the importance of objective physical examinations during the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders."
"5741","1","[Reliability and validity of self-reported drug use among secondary school students].^
OBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and validity of self-reported use among secondary school students. METHOD: Validity was assessed in a representative sample of nearly 1,300 students by analyzing: a) the proportion of questions on drug use left unanswered compared with that for other questions; b) the proportion of inconsistencies between related questions; c) the proportion of questions wrongly completed; d) admision of ficticious drug use; e) the relationship between self-reported drug use and that of friends', and f) willingness to admit cannabis and ecstasy use. Reliability was analyzed using the kappa index, the proportion of specific agreement, and the intra-class correlation coefficient in a test-retest procedure in a randomized subsample of 349 students. RESULTS: The response rate to questions on drug use was high and was similar to that for more neutral questions. Only 0,3% of the secondary school students reported having used a fictitious drug. Except in the case of heroin, individual drug use was directly related to friends' perception of consumption. A very low proportion of students would not be willing to admit to use of cannabis (2%) or ecstasy (3,4%). Questions referring to drug use at some time during students' lives showed greater reliability than those referring to more recent drug use (last 12 months). The kappa indexes for drug consumption at some time during students lives ranged from 0.65 to 0.87, except for ecstasy and LSD (0.51 and 0.52 respectively). The age of first drug consumption was highly reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.71 to 1). CONCLUSIONS: Except for ectasy, amphetamines and LSD, indexes of reliability and validity were generally good and similar to those obtained in other studies. These findings support the idea that information about self-reported drug use obtained through a questionnaire is reliable and valid, although the absolute prevalences of the use of some drugs should be interpreted with caution. The indicator of consumption at some time during students' lives is especially useful in studies monitoring drug use among this population."
"9297","1","An item response theory analysis of DSM-IV criteria for hallucinogen abuse and dependence in adolescents.^
Aim: This study applied both item response theory (IRT) and multiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) methods to evaluate item-level psychometric properties of diagnostic questions for hallucinogen use disorders (HUDs), differential item functioning (DIF), and predictors of latent HUD. Methods: Data were drawn from 2004-2006 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Analyses were based on 1548 past-year hallucinogen users aged 12-17 years. Substance use and symptoms were assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Results: Abuse and dependence criteria empirically were arrayed along a single continuum of severity. All abuse criteria indicated middle-to-high severity on the IRT-defined HUD continuum, while dependence criteria captured a wider range from the lowest (tolerance and time spent) to the highest (taking larger amounts and inability to cut down) severity levels. There was indication of DIF by hallucinogen users' age, gender, race/ethnicity, and ecstasy use status. Adjusting for DIF, ecstasy users (vs. non-ecstasy hallucinogen users), females (vs. males), and whites (vs. Hispanics) exhibited increased odds of HUD. Conclusions: Symptoms of hallucinogen abuse and dependence empirically do not reflect two discrete conditions in adolescents. Trends and problems related to hallucinogen use among girls and whites should be examined further to inform the designs of effective gender-appropriate and culturally sensitive prevention programs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd."
"4415","1","Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.^
Given the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4 mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine’s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

"2629","1","Test-retest reliability and cross-cultural applicability of DSM-5 adopted diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorders.^
Background: Despite increasing prevalence of nonmedical ketamine use globally, data on ketamine use disorders, which are classified in the DSM-5 under criteria for phencyclidine, are limited. This study assessed the reliability and applicability of DSM-based diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorder. Methods: Participants who used ecstasy were recruited through the Tri-City Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse, and Dependence in St. Louis, Miami, and Sydney. Those who reported using ketamine (lifetime use >5 times) were included in these analyses (n = 205). Participants were interviewed using the computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drugs (CD-SAM) at baseline and 7 days later for the reliability of diagnoses and individual diagnostic criteria. Results: Overall, 29.3% met DSM-5 adopted criteria for ketamine use disorder at Time 1. Moderate to excellent test-retest reliability was observed consistently across study sites for any ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.57, Y = 0.61) and severe ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.62, Y = 0.79). Continued use of ketamine despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems was the most frequently endorsed individual criterion (59.0%), followed by reported withdrawal (30.2%) and physically hazardous use (29.8%). All individual criteria had acceptable reliability estimates (κ ≥ 0.41). Conclusions: Diagnoses of ketamine use disorder can be reliably evaluated using this fully structured diagnostic instrument's questions and algorithm. Ketamine-related withdrawal among people who use ketamine should be re-evaluated. Considering that after-effects of this dissociative anesthetic can last for many hours, it is important to explore a different timeframe for possible withdrawal effects."

Numerous clinical trials have reported that intravenous (IV) ketamine demonstrates rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These studies, however, have not characterized whether these antidepressant effects translate to improvements in workplace productivity and functionality. Adults with TRD received repeated doses of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic (n = 171). We evaluated patient outcomes at two timepoints of interest: (1) acute-phase (i.e., following 4-6 infusions, 17.6 ± 12.6 days from baseline) and (2) maintenance-phase (i.e., following 7-10 infusions, 153.9 ± 63.4 days from baseline). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to maintenance-phase scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) workplace/school item as well as days underproductive (i.e., presenteeism) and days lost (i.e., absenteeism). Secondary measures included the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)). There was a significant reduction in workplace/school disability, and significantly reduced symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism. At the acute-phase outcome, this translated to 2 more days of productivity and 1.5 less days absent from work. Additionally, IV ketamine exhibited a sustained antidepressant effect across the ten infusions. IV ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in workplace/school disability and demonstrated improvements in symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism."

dl-Fenfluramine hydrochloride (60, 120, 240 mg), d-amphetamine sulfate (20, 40 mg), and placebo were compared in 8 postaddict volunteers, each dose given orally in random sequence at weekly intervals using a double-blind crossover design. Fenfluramine had little effect on blood pressure and temperature, but caused a marked dilation of pupils, whereas amphetamine was a potent vasopressor and a weak mydriatic. While fenfluramine produced euphoria in some subjects, its overall effects were unpleasant, sedative, and qualitatively different from amphetamine. Three subjects given 240 mg of fenfluramine experienced brief but vivid hallucinogenic episodes characterized by olfactory, visual, and somatic hallucinations, abrupt polar changes in mood, time distortion, fleeting paranoia, and sexual ideation. These observations indicate that fenfluramine is a hallucinogenic agent with a pharmacologic profile in man that is not amphetamine-like."

BACKGROUND: The demands of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) change with experience. This report contains two studies designed to examine N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor contributions to the executive components of WCST performance. These aspects of WCST performance figure more prominently in the initial completion of this task than in subsequent task repetitions in healthy populations. METHODS: In the first study, healthy subjects (n = 15) completed the WCST on two occasions separated by 1 week. In the second study, healthy subjects (n = 22) completed two test days spaced by approximately 1 week, during which, they completed the WCST and other assessments after administration of the NMDA antagonist ketamine (intravenous bolus 0.26 mg/kg followed by infusion of 0.65 mg/kg/hour) or matched placebo. RESULTS: In the first study, subjects reduced the number of total and perseverative errors with a single repetition of the WCST. In the second study, ketamine significantly increased the number of total errors and the number and percent of perseverative errors on the first, but not the second test day. Similarly, it reduced the number of category criteria met on the first, but not second test day. Ketamine also increased distractibility, impaired recall, produced psychosis, altered perception, and had effects resembling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, only WCST performance showed order dependency. CONCLUSIONS: This order dependency further implicates NMDA receptors in executive cognitive functions associated with the frontal cortex."

PURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) on the human brain by using diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight abstinent ecstasy users and six ecstasy nonusers underwent diffusion and perfusion MR imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient and relative cerebral volume maps were reconstructed. Differences in apparent diffusion coefficient values and relative cerebral volume ratios between the groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The relationship between apparent diffusion coefficient and relative cerebral volume and the extent of previous ecstasy use was investigated with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Apparent diffusion coefficient values (0.84 vs 0.65 × 10-5 cm2/sec, P < .025) and relative cerebral volume ratios (1.22 vs 1.01, P < .025) were significantly higher in the globus pallidus of ecstasy users compared with nonusers, respectively. Increases in pallidal relative cerebral volume were positively correlated with the extent of previous use of ecstasy (p = 0.73, P < .04). CONCLUSION: Ecstasy use is associated with tissue changes in the globus pallidus. These findings are in agreement with findings in case reports, suggesting that the globus pallidus is particularly sensitive to the effects of ecstasy."
"6211","0","Antidepressant Effects of Nitrous Oxide.^
The investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the antidepressant effects of nitrous oxide in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is a global medical condition that causes significant health and economic burden. Recent studies have shown that a single dose of ketamine, an NMDA‐antagonist, has fast and long lasting anti‐depressant effect. Nitrous oxide, another NMDA‐antagonist, is widely used for anesthesia and analgesia, safer to administer and has fewer side effects than ketamine. A randomized controlled crossover feasibility study showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms at 2 and 24 hours after a single 1‐hour treatment session of inhaled nitrous oxide compared with placebo. Nitrous oxide is inexpensive and can be safely administered by any trained clinician. If found to be efficacious, it could be used to provide rapid anti‐depressant effect whilst the benefit of traditional anti‐depressants has its delayed effect. Another potential application could be in acutely suicidal patients. This trial will enable confirmation and extension of the findings from the feasibility study, and identify the optimal dose and regimen in a broader population of those with MDD. Participants will be randomized to receive a weekly 1‐hour inhalational session of either nitrous oxide or placebo (oxygen‐air mixture) for 4 weeks, and the nitrous group will be further randomly assigned to a dose of 50% or 25% nitrous oxide. Depression severity and outcomes related to treatment responses will be continuously assessed by a 'blinded���to‐randomization' psychiatry (MD) rater at weekly intervals during study patient participation, using validated psychiatric diagnostics (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale‐21 [HDRS‐21 or HAM‐D]; Profile of Mood States [POMS]; Computerized Adaptive Test‐Mental Health [CAT‐MH]; Sheehan‐STS [S‐STS]; Visual Analog Scale [VAS])."

"5972","0","Reliability of three versus five saliva sampling times for assessing the cortisol awakening response.^
The cortisol awakening response (CAR) describes the sharp increase in cortisol secretion within 60 min after awakening. A summary of the CAR, the area under the cortisol curve above the awakening cortisol value (AUCi) is a widely used biomarker in health research. Estimation of the AUCi rely on a number of collected salivary samples at fixed time intervals (i.e., 5 samples in 15 min intervals) starting from awakening. Little empirical work has been executed to investigate the impact of reducing sampling times on AUCi estimation, which could potentially improve participant compliance and reduce operational costs. This study aimed to assess the reli-ability and validity of using 3-sample AUCi versus 5-sample AUCi, i.e., systematic and random fluctuations based on a large dataset from healthy and case individuals (total n = 537). We showed that the ideal timing of 3 -sam-pling times was 0-30-60 min with a median difference in AUCi of -8 nmol*h/L and interquartile range of 65 nmol*h/L among healthy individuals, and -12 nmol*h/L and 78 nmol*h/L among case individuals. We sub-sequently validated the 3-sample AUCi by re-analyzing three published association studies. Overall, we obtained similar p-values with 3-sample AUCi when compared to 5-sample AUCi, while smaller effect sizes and standard errors were observed. In conclusion, despite a less precise estimation of the AUCi itself, our data support that the AUC measure of the CAR, based on three samples collected at 0-30-60 min from awakening, provides reliable results in association studies."
"8198","1","Assessment of ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter in humans with positron emission tomography.^
Background: Comprehensive description of ketamine’s molecular binding profile becomes increasingly pressing as use in real-life patient cohorts widens. Animal studies attribute a significant role in the substance’s antidepressant effects to the serotonergic system. The serotonin transporter is a highly relevant target in this context, because it is central to depressive pathophysiology and treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding in vivo in humans. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects were assessed twice using [¹¹C]DASB positron emission tomography. A total of 0.50 mg/kg bodyweight ketamine was administered once i.v. prior to the second positron emission tomography scan. Ketamine plasma levels were determined during positron emission tomography. Serotonin transporter nondisplaceable binding potential was computed using a reference region model, and occupancy was calculated for 4 serotonin transporter-rich regions (caudate, putamen, thalamus, midbrain) and a whole-brain region of interest. Results: After administration of the routine antidepressant dose, ketamine showed < 10% occupancy of the serotonin transporter, which is within the test-retest variability of [¹¹C]DASB. A positive correlation between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy was shown. Conclusions: Measurable occupancy of the serotonin transporter was not detectable after administration of an antidepressant dose of ketamine. This might suggest that ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter is unlikely to be a primary antidepressant mechanism at routine antidepressant doses, as substances that facilitate antidepressant effects via serotonin transporter binding (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) show 70% to 80% occupancy. Administration of high-dose ketamine is widening. Based on the positive relationship we find between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy, there is a need for investigation of ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding at higher doses.

Objective: To observe the efficacy and safety of S(+)-ketamine combined with sufentanil for patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer and explore its impact on patients' early recovery. Methods: One hundred and ten patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer in Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from December 2020 to March 2021, were divided into two groups (n=55) using a random number table: group S received PCIA, with continuous infusion of S(+)-ketamine combined with sufentanil, while group C received PCIA, with continuous infusion of sufentanil. PCIA was initiated at the end of the surgery, and the formulations were as follows: group S, S(+)-ketamine (1.44 mg/kg), sufentanil (1.05 μg/kg), ketorolac tromethamine (2.0 mg/kg) and tropisetron (5 mg), in 100 ml of normal saline; group C: sufentanil (1.50 μg/kg), ketorolac tromethamine (2.0 mg/kg) and tropisetron (5 mg), in 100 ml of normal saline. Postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Ramsay sedation scale were recorded at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h after the surgery. The incidence of remedial analgesia, the effective compressions number of PCI during 48 h after the operation. Time to first ambulation, time to first anal exhaust, time to resume oral feeding were recorded. The occurrence of adverse effects was compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 10 patients were excluded during the study, including 4 cases of conversion to laparotomy, 3 cases of dropping out of the study, and 3 cases with operation time more than 4 hours. Finally, 50 cases in group S and 50 cases in group C completed the study. There were no significant differences in VAS scores and Ramsay sedation sores at all time points between two groups (all P>0.05). Likewise, there were also no significant differences in the number of remedial analgesia and effective compressions of PCIA during 48 h after the operation between the two groups (both P>0.05). The total dosage of sufentanil consumption in group S [(64±9) μg] was lower than that in group C [(95±12) μg] within 48 h of PCIA, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). Time to first ambulation in group S was (1.1±0.2) d, which was shorter than that in group C [(1.6±0.5) d], and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Likewise, time to first anal exhaust in group S [(1.3±0.4) d] was shorter than that in group C [(1.8±0.6) d], with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). Additionally, time to resume oral feeding in group S was (2.5±0.6) d, which was shorter than that in group C [(3.1±0.7) d], and there was a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). The incidence of nausea, vomiting and pruritus in group S were 4.0%, 2.0% and 0, which were lower than that in group C (16.0%, 10% and 8.0%, respectively), with statistically significant differences (all P<0.05). No case with psychiatric symptoms was found in both groups. Conclusion: When used for postoperative intravenous analgesia in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer, S(+)-ketamine combined with sufentanil can provide satisfactory analgesic effects, decrease total consumption of sufentanil and the incidence of adverse effects, and thus facilitate patients' early recovery."
"4420","1","The Safety, Clinical, and Neurophysiological Effects of Intranasal Ketamine in Patients Who Do Not Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^
BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is among the most disabling illnesses worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression. However, esketamine is challenging to access due to high costs and limited availability. Racemic ketamine (rketamine) is cheap and easy to access; however, the effects in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy have yet to be understood or tested. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study mechanisms of human brain cortical physiology at the systemic level to identify neurobiomarkers of response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study has received ethics approval, and funding has been secured. The study is currently active. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to test repeated doses of intranasal rketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Results from this study will (1) inform the development of a larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for depression and (2) determine potential neurophysiological markers of clinical response.

"2143","1","Pharmacology of ayahuasca administered in two repeated doses.^
RATIONALE: Ayahuasca is an Amazonian tea containing the natural psychedelic 5-HT(2A/2C/1A) agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is used in ceremonial contexts for its visionary properties. The human pharmacology of ayahuasca has been well characterized following its administration in single doses. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the human pharmacology of ayahuasca in repeated doses and assess the potential occurrence of acute tolerance or sensitization. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial, nine experienced psychedelic drug users received PO the two following treatment combinations at least 1 week apart: (a) a lactose placebo and then, 4 h later, an ayahuasca dose; and (b) two ayahuasca doses 4 h apart. All ayahuasca doses were freeze-dried Amazonian-sourced tea encapsulated to a standardized 0.75 mg DMT/kg bodyweight. Subjective, neurophysiological, cardiovascular, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and cell immunity measures were obtained before and at regular time intervals until 12 h after first dose administration. RESULTS: DMT plasma concentrations, scores in subjective and neurophysiological variables, and serum prolactin and cortisol were significantly higher after two consecutive doses. When effects were standardized by plasma DMT concentrations, no differences were observed for subjective, neurophysiological, autonomic, or immunological effects. However, we observed a trend to reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and a significant decrease for growth hormone (GH) after the second ayahuasca dose. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas there was no clear-cut tolerance or sensitization in the psychological sphere or most physiological variables, a trend to lower cardiovascular activation was observed, together with significant tolerance to GH secretion."
"6753","0","Ecstasy (MDMA) mimics the post-orgasmic state: impairment of sexual drive and function during acute MDMA-effects may be due to increased prolactin secretion.^
Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""Ecstasy"") is a major stimulant drug of abuse worldwide. MDMA produces euphoria, enhances interpersonal communication and feelings of closeness with others. In contrast to the induced emotions of affection and sensual enhancement, clinical studies show that it impairs sexual drive and functioning. In drug-free humans, sexual stimulation with orgasm induces a pronounced secretion of prolactin, which may mediate the post-orgasmic state. The phenomenological features of the psychological state induced by MDMA show some similarities with features of the post-orgasmic state. In addition, MDMA also induces a prominent increase of prolactin plasma levels with a similar time kinetic compared to the post-orgasmic prolactin increase. Here, we present the hypothesis that the impairment of sexual parameters after MDMA may be mediated by increased prolactin."
"5494","1","A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ketamine in the rapid treatment of major depressive episodes.^
BACKGROUND: There is growing interest in glutamatergic agents in depression, particularly ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We aimed to assess the efficacy of ketamine in major depressive episodes. METHOD: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Medline from 1962 to January 2014 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post-treatment. Analyses employed a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from seven RCTs employing an intravenous infusion and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 73 subjects in parallel arms and 110 subjects in cross-over designs [n = 34 with bipolar disorder (BD), n = 149 with major depressive disorder (MDD)]. Ketamine was associated with higher rates of clinical remission relative to comparator (saline or midazolam) at 24 h [OR 7.06, number needed to treat (NNT) = 5], 3 days (OR 3.86, NNT = 6), and 7 days (OR 4.00, NNT = 6), as well as higher rates of clinical response at 24 h (OR 9.10, NNT = 3), 3 days (OR 6.77, NNT = 3), and 7 days (OR 4.87, NNT = 4). A standardized mean difference of 0.90 in favor of ketamine was observed at 24 h based on depression rating scale scores, with group comparisons revealing greater efficacy in unipolar depression compared to bipolar depression (1.07 v. 0.68). Ketamine was associated with transient psychotomimetic effects, but no persistent psychosis or affective switches. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that single administrations ketamine are efficacious in the rapid treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression. Additional research is required to determine optimal dosing schedules, route, treatment schedules, and the potential efficacy of other glutamatergic agents."
"77","1","Dose-related effects of ketamine for antidepressant-resistant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans and active duty military: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trial.^
This study tested the efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine doses to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans and service members with PTSD (n = 158) who failed previous antidepressant treatment were randomized to 8 infusions administered twice weekly of intravenous placebo (n = 54), low dose (0.2 mg/kg; n = 53) or standard dose (0.5 mg/kg; n = 51) ketamine. Participants were assessed at baseline, during treatment, and for 4 weeks after their last infusion. Primary analyses used mixed effects models. The primary outcome measure was the self-report PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and secondary outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). There were no significant group-by-time interactions for PTSD symptoms measured by the PCL-5 or CAPS-5. The standard ketamine dose ameliorated depression measured by the MADRS significantly more than placebo. Ketamine produced dose-related dissociative and psychotomimetic effects, which returned to baseline within 2 h and were less pronounced with repeated administration. There was no evidence of differential treatment discontinuation by ketamine dose, consistent with good tolerability. This clinical trial failed to find a significant dose-related effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses suggested that the standard dose exerted rapid antidepressant effects. Further studies are needed to determine the role of ketamine in PTSD treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02655692."
"1762","1","Transient resolution of treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder following ketamine infusion.^
Presents a case report of a 23-year-old veteran presented to a European Army Medical Center in 2008 complaining of irritability and poor sleep, 6 months after a 15-month deployment. His platoon had been stationed at a remote outpost subject to daily bombardment, with the veteran participating in more than 300 firefights, frequent enough that he reported that by the end he dragged himself out of bed automatically at the sound of gunfire, donned gear, and numbly moved to his defensive position. He had multiple confirmed kills, watched several soldiers close to him wounded and killed, and was grazed by a sniper bullet while on guard duty. Guilt feelings became unbearable after one firefight that killed an Afghan child. Despite disillusionment and increasing psychological turmoil, he sought no treatment while in country. According to the veteran and his wife, PTSD symptoms worsened in the year after his return to Europe. He had nightly fragmented sleep of only 3 hours during which he thrashed, screamed, and had nightmares of loved ones being killed in combat, awakening drenched in sweat. Treatment was approved by the local U.S. Army medical commander and followed published protocols. After a 24-hour medication washout, the veteran was administered propofol 30 mg and ketamine 35 mg in the postanesthesia care unit over 20 minutes under the supervision of a psychiatrist and anesthesiologist. The veteran regained consciousness and experienced no side effects except transient nystagmus and visual distortions. This case report indicates that intravenous ketamine may be efficacious even for extremely treatment-resistant PTSD. Previous reports have noted that incidental perioperative ketamine decreases subsequent PTSD symptoms in burn patients but worsens them in moderately injured physical trauma survivors When given experimentally acutely after trauma, ketamine either worsened PTSD or had no effect. A Phase II trial in nontreatment-resistant PTSD is currently underway at Mount Sinai. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"4112","1","A Systematic Review on the Efficacy of Intravenous Racemic Ketamine for Bipolar Depression.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the efficacy of intravenous ketamine augmentation in treatment-resistant depression patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Major databases were searched for open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCT). Two independent reviewers screened and selected the studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were selected following the standard Cochrane methodology, and the findings are reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using standardized measures. RESULTS: A total of 1442 articles were screened. Five studies were included in the systematic review (3 RCTs and 2 open-label studies) enrolling 110 subjects (mean age, 45.54 ± 12.65 years; 68.18% female). All the RCTs and open-label studies showed improvement in depressions symptoms after receiving a single infusion of ketamine. Included studies also suggested improvement in suicidal ideation and anhedonia after ketamine infusion. Dissociation and transient increase in blood pressure were the most common reported adverse effects with ketamine. Ketamine infusions did not increase mania symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data show efficacy and feasibility of intravenous racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant bipolar depression. Further studies with larger sample size are required to strengthen the evidence."
"7304","1","Effects of the South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca on regional brain electrical activity in humans: a functional neuroimaging study using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography.^
Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines monoamine oxidase-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids with N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic agent showing 5-HT(2A) agonist activity. In a clinical research setting, ayahuasca has demonstrated a combined stimulatory and psychedelic effect profile, as measured by subjective effect self-assessment instruments and dose-dependent changes in spontaneous brain electrical activity, which parallel the time course of subjective effects. In the present study, the spatial distribution of ayahuasca-induced changes in brain electrical activity was investigated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Electroencephalography recordings were obtained from 18 volunteers after the administration of a dose of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca containing 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight and placebo. The intracerebral power density distribution was computed with LORETA from spectrally analyzed data, and subjective effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for LORETA power 60 and 90 min after dosing, together with increases in all six scales of the HRS. Ayahuasca decreased power density in the alpha-2, delta, theta and beta-1 frequency bands. Power decreases in the delta, alpha-2 and beta-1 bands were found predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, whereas theta power was reduced in the temporomedial cortex and in frontomedial regions. The present results suggest the involvement of unimodal and heteromodal association cortex and limbic structures in the psychological effects elicited by ayahuasca."
"1482","1","Brain volume in chronic ketamine users - relationship to sub-threshold psychotic symptoms and relevance to schizophrenia.^
RATIONALE: Ketamine may model aspects of schizophrenia arising through NMDA receptor activity deficits. Although acute ketamine can induce effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, chronic use may be a closer model of idiopathic psychosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that ketamine users had lower brain volumes, as measured using MRI, and greater sub-threshold psychotic symptoms relative to a poly-drug user control group. METHODS: Ketamine users (n = 17) and poly-drug using controls (n = 19) were included in the study. All underwent volumetric MRI imaging and measurement of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Freesurfer was used to analyse differences in regional brain volume, cortical surface area and thickness between ketamine users and controls. The relationship between CAARMS ratings and brain volume was also investigated in ketamine users. RESULTS: Ketamine users were found to have significantly lower grey matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and total cortex (FDR p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.36-0.75). Within the cortex, ketamine users had significantly lower grey matter volumes within the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices (Cohen's d 0.7-1.31; FDR p < 0.05). They also had significantly higher sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (p < 0.05). Frequency of ketamine use showed an inverse correlation with cerebellar volume (p < 0.001), but there was no relationship between regional brain volumes and sub-threshold psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ketamine use may cause lower grey matter volumes as well as inducing sub-threshold psychotic symptoms, although these likely arise through distinct mechanisms."

The authors review the research on N,N dimethyltryptamine (DMT) as a possible 'schizotoxin'. DMT produces psychedelic effects when administered to normal subjects, the means are present to synthesize it in man, it has occasionally been found in man, and tolerance to its behavioral effects is incomplete. However, DMT concentrations have not been proven to differ significantly in schizophrenics and normal controls. Also, in vivo synthesis of DMT has not been convincingly demonstrated, and the psychological changes it produces do not closely mimic the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"8604","0","The neurobehavioral pharmacology of ketamine: implications for drug abuse, addiction, and psychiatric disorders.^
Ketamine was developed in the early 1960s as an anesthetic and has been used for medical and veterinary procedures since then. Its unique profile of effects has led to its use at subanesthetic doses for a variety of other purposes: it is an effective analgesic and can prevent certain types of pathological pain; it produces schizophrenia-like effects and so is used in both clinical studies and preclinical animal models to better understand this disorder; it has rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects; and it is popular as a drug of abuse both among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers. In this article we summarize recent research that provides insight into the myriad uses of ketamine. Clinical research is discussed, but the focus is on preclinical animal research, including recent findings from our own laboratory. Of particular note, although ketamine is normally considered a locomotor stimulant at subanesthetic doses, we have found locomotor depressant effects at very low subanesthetic doses. Thus, rather than a monotonic dose-dependent increase in activity, ketamine produces a more complex dose response. Additional work explores the mechanism of action of ketamine, ketamine-induced neuroadaptations, and ketamine reward. The findings described will inform future research on ketamine and lead to a better understanding of both its clinical uses and its abuse."
"1850","1","Neuronal correlates of visual and auditory alertness in the DMT and ketamine model of psychosis.^
Deficits in attentional functions belong to the core cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Alertness is a nonselective attention component that refers to a state of general readiness that improves stimulus processing and response initiation. The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks."

Aims This study evaluated the prevalence and reliability of DSM-IV adopted criteria for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse and dependence with a purpose to determine whether it is best conceptualized within the category of hallucinogens, amphetamines or its own category. Design Test-re-test study. Participants MDMA users (life-time use >5 times) were recruited in St Louis, Miami and Sydney (n = 593). The median life-time MDMA consumption was 50 pills at the baseline. Measurements The computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drug (CD-SAM) was used to assess MDMA abuse and dependence. The Discrepancy Interview Protocol (DIP) was used to determine the reasons for the discrepant responses between the two interviews. Reliability of diagnoses, individual diagnostic criteria and withdrawal symptoms was examined using the kappa coefficient (κ). Findings For baseline data, 15% and 59% met MDMA abuse and dependence, respectively. Substantial test-re-test reliability of the diagnoses was observed consistently across cities (κ = 0.69). 'Continued use despite knowledge of physical/psychological problems' (87%) and 'withdrawal' (68%) were the two most prevalent dependence criteria. 'Physically hazardous use' was the most prevalent abuse criterion. Six dependence criteria and all abuse criteria were reported reliably across cities (κ: 0.53-0.77). Seventeen of 19 withdrawal symptoms showed consistency in the reliability across cities. The most commonly reported reason for discrepant responses was 'interpretation of question changed'. Only a small proportion of the total discrepancies were attributed to lying or social desirability. Conclusion The adopted DSM-IV diagnostic classification for MDMA abuse and dependence was moderately reliable across cities. Findings on MDMA withdrawal support the argument that MDMA should be separated from other hallucinogens in DSM. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction."
"1919","0","Human pharmacology of MDMA: pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and disposition.^
MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors ""entactogen"" properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme-metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system."
"4633","1","Creative processes under the influence of a low dose of LSD: a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in healthy volunteers.^
Background: Previously scientific studies have shown the potential of psychedelics in full hallucinogenic doses to change creativity, with enhancing effects on divergent thinking specifically while under the influence of the substance. This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub‐hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms. While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce, we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study. Methods: The study was conducted according to a doubleblind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject design with four oral LSD doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg, LSD base) given on four separate test days, with minimally five days of washout in between. LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 μg LSD base in 1mL ethanol (96%) which resulted in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mL LSD, for 5, 10, and 20 μg LSD. Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe. To mask the treatment condition, ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume. Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only (96%). Participants were 24 healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) aged 22.75 on average (SD = 2.97). All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs. Task‐based creativity was assessed three hours post‐treatment with the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and five hours post‐treatment with the Story Writing task. In the latter participants were asked to write a (non)‐fictive story around two given words. To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story, two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score. The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World‐Medical‐ Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within‐subject factor; additional within‐subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category. Partial eta squared (partial η2) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude, and it is based on Cohen's f, which defines small, medium, and large as respectively 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50, which corresponds to partial η2 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14. Results: GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency (F3,69 = 0.65, p = 0.59, partial η2 = 0.03), Elaboration (F3,69 = 0.09, p = 0.99, partial η2 = 0.004), Flexibility (F3,69 = 2.30, p = 0.08, partial η2 = 0.09), Originality (F3,69 = 0.28, p = 0.84, partial η2 = 0.01), and Ra io (F3,66 = 0.17, p = 0.92, partial η2 = 0.01). RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.05) on rater‐scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial η2 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial η2 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial η2 = 0.05) on the self‐rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post‐administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 μg, respectively. Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration, when the Story Writing Task was performed, were 69 (21), 137 (57), and 258 (112) pg/mL after the 5, 10, and 20 μg dose, respectively. Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task‐based or self‐rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo‐controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations."
"3728","1","Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.^
Background: NMDA receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal (S)-ketamine, one of the most potent clinically available NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain of various origins were randomized into two treatment groups: (S)-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (group 1); (S)-ketamine 0.4 mg/kg (group 2). Plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine were measured over 6 h by High Performance Liquid Chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted before, during and after treatment. Side effects and amount of pain reduction were recorded. Results: Intranasal (S)-ketamine administration lead to peak plasma concentrations of 27.7 ± 5.9 ng/ml at 10 ± 6.3 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 22.2 ng/ml at 13.8 ± 4.8 min after application (group 2). Maximal plasma concentrations of (S)-norketamine were 18.3 ± 14.9 ng/ml at 81 ± 59 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml at 75 ± 40 min (group 2). Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups with minimal pain at 60 min after drug administration (70 ± 10% and 61 ± 13% of initial pain in groups 1 and 2). The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine. The time course of analgesia correlated with plasma concentrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

"4487","0","Converging theories on dreaming: Between Freud, predictive processing, and psychedelic research.^
Dreams are still an enigma of human cognition, studied extensively in psychoanalysis and neuroscience. According to the Freudian dream theory and Solms' modifications of the unconscious derived from it, the fundamental task of meeting our emotional needs is guided by the principle of homeostasis. Our innate value system generates conscious feelings of pleasure and unpleasure, resulting in the behavior of approaching or withdrawing from the world of objects. Based on these experiences, a hierarchical generative model of predictions (priors) about the world is constantly created and modified, with the aim to optimize the meeting of our needs by reducing prediction error, as described in the predictive processing model of cognition. Growing evidence from neuroimaging supports this theory. The same hierarchical functioning of the brain is in place during sleep and dreaming, with some important modifications like a lack of sensual and motor perception and action. Another characteristic of dreaming is the predominance of primary process thinking, an associative, non-rational cognitive style, which can be found in similar altered states of consciousness like the effect of psychedelics. Mental events that do not successfully fulfill an emotional need will cause a prediction error, leading to conscious attention and adaptation of the priors that incorrectly predicted the event. However, this is not the case for repressed priors (RPs), which are defined by the inability to become reconsolidated or removed, despite ongoing error signal production. We hypothesize that Solms' RPs correspond with the conflictual complexes, as described by Moser in his dream formation theory. Thus, in dreams and dream-like states, these unconscious RPs might become accessible in symbolic and non-declarative forms that the subject is able to feel and make sense of. Finally, we present the similarities between dreaming and the psychedelic state. Insights from psychedelic research could be used to inform dream research and related therapeutic interventions, and vice versa. We propose further empirical research questions and methods and finally present our ongoing trial ""Biological Functions of Dreaming"" to test the hypothesis that dreaming predicts intact sleep architecture and memory consolidation, via a lesion model with stroke patients who lost the ability to dream."

"4901","1","Cortical dynamics during psychedelic and anesthetized states induced by ketamine.^
Ketamine is a unique drug that has psychedelic and anesthetic properties in a dose-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that ketamine anesthesia appears to maintain the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical activation evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, while a psychedelic dose of ketamine is associated with increased spontaneous magnetoencephalographic signal diversity. However, a systematic investigation of the dose-dependent effects of ketamine on cortical complexity using the same modality is required. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the complexity level stabilizes or fluctuates over time for the duration of ketamine exposure. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal complexity of spontaneous high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals in healthy volunteers during alterations of consciousness induced by both subanesthetic and anesthetic doses of ketamine. Given the fast transient spectral dynamics, especially during the gamma-burst pattern after loss of consciousness, we employed a method based on Hidden Markov modeling to classify the EEG signals into a discrete set of brain states that correlated with different behavioral states. We characterized the spatiotemporal complexity specific for each brain state as measured through the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. After controlling for signal diversity due to spectral changes, we found that the subanesthetic dose of ketamine is associated with an elevated complexity level relative to baseline, while the brain activity following an anesthetic dose of ketamine is characterized by alternating low and high complexity levels until stabilizing at a high level comparable to that during baseline. Thus, spatiotemporal complexity associated with ketamine-induced state transitions has features of general anesthesia, normal consciousness, and altered states of consciousness. These results improve our understanding of the complex pharmacological, neurophysiological, and phenomenological properties of ketamine."
"3937","0","The Nonclassic Psychedelic Ibogaine Disrupts Cognitive Maps.^
Background: The ability of psychedelic compounds to profoundly alter mental function has been long known, but the underlying changes in cellular-level information encoding remain poorly understood. Methods: We used two-photon microscopy to record from the retrosplenial cortex in head-fixed mice running on a treadmill before and after injection of the nonclassic psychedelic ibogaine (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Results: We found that the cognitive map, formed by the representation of position encoded by ensembles of individual neurons in the retrosplenial cortex, was destabilized by ibogaine when mice had to infer position between tactile landmarks. This corresponded with increased neural activity rates, loss of correlation structure, and increased responses to cues. Ibogaine had surprisingly little effect on the size-frequency distribution of network activity events, suggesting that signal propagation within the retrosplenial cortex was largely unaffected. Conclusions: Taken together, these data support proposals that compounds with psychedelic properties disrupt representations that are important for constraining neocortical activity, thereby increasing the entropy of neural signaling. Furthermore, the loss of expected position encoding between landmarks recapitulated effects of hippocampal impairment, suggesting that disruption of cognitive maps or other hippocampal processing may be a contributing mechanism of discoordinated neocortical activity in psychedelic states."
"4460","1","Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations.^
Visual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 μg/kg vs placebo) on both α oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital α power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced α power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of α oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."
