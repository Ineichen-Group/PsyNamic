However, sBDNF was significantly elevated only at one week following the first ketamine infusion in those classified as responders one week later. sBDNF was not elevated following subsequent infusions. ECT reduced depressive symptoms, as expected, but was not associated with an enhancement in BDNF. Limitations: Patients continued with their psychotropic medications throughout this trial. Conclusions: SBDNF normalisation does not appear to be a prerequisite for symptomatic improvement in TRD following ketamine or ECT treatment.

METHODS: Hospitalized patients with unipolar depression were randomized (1:1) to thrice-weekly racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions or ECT in a parallel, open-label, non-inferiority study. The primary outcome was remission (Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score ≤10). Secondary outcomes included adverse events (AEs), time to remission, and relapse. Treatment sessions (maximum of 12) were administered until remission or maximal effect was achieved. Remitters were followed for 12 months after the final treatment session. RESULTS: In total 186 inpatients were included and received treatment. Among patients receiving ECT, 63% remitted compared with 46% receiving ketamine infusions (P = .026; difference 95% CI 2%, 30%). Both ketamine and ECT required a median of 6 treatment sessions to induce remission. Distinct AEs were associated with each treatment. Serious and long-lasting AEs, including cases of persisting amnesia, were more common with ECT, while treatment-emergent AEs led to more dropouts in the ketamine group.

The use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy treatment reduced patient's Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) scores from baseline more than control psychotherapy (–22.03; 95%CI, –38.53 to –5.52) but with high statistical heterogeneity. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy enhanced the achievement of clinically significant reductions in CAPS scores (relative risk, 3.65; 95%CI, 2.39-5.57) and CAPS score reductions sufficient to no longer meet the definition of PTSD (relative risk, 2.10; 95%CI, 1.37-3.21) with no detected statistical heterogeneity. While therapy was generally safe and well tolerated, bruxism, anxiety, jitteriness, headache, and nausea are commonly reported. While MDMA-assisted psychotherapy has been shown to be an effective therapy for patients with PTSD with a reasonable safety profile, use of unregulated MDMA or use in the absence of a strongly controlled psychotherapeutic environment has considerable risks.", "doi": "10.1002/jcph.1995", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34708874/", "secondary_title": "Journal of Clinical Pharmacology", "annotation": "Clinical Measure"}

Previous studies have reported that serial ketamine therapy modulates resting state functional connectivity in several large-scale networks, though it remains unknown whether variations in brain structure, function, and connectivity impact subsequent treatment success.

Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C), and the Rumination Response Scale (RRS) before and 24 h after patients received four (0.5 mg/kg) infusions of racemic ketamine over 2 weeks. Nineteen unaffected controls were assessed at similar timepoints. Random forest regression models predicted symptom changes using pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging and demographic measures.

Method: Data were collected from regular ecstasy users (n = 810) recruited from all eight capital cities of Australia. Data were analysed using multiple logistic regression and chi-square (χ2) tests of association. Open-ended responses were coded for themes. Results: The majority of the sample (84%) reported attempting to find out the content and purity of ecstasy at least some of the time, most commonly asking friends or dealers. Less than one quarter (22%) reported personal use of testing kits. There was a moderate level of awareness of the limitations of testing kits among those who reported having used them. Over half (57%) of those reporting personal use of testing kits reported that they would not take a pill if test results indicated that it contained ketamine and over three quarters (76%) reported that they would not take an \"unknown\" pill (producing no reaction in a reagent test). Finally, a considerable majority (63%) expressed interest in pill testing should it be more widely available. Conclusions: The majority of regular ecstasy users sampled in this Australian study report previous attempts to determine the content and purity of pills sold as ecstasy. Although only a small proportion have used testing kits, many report that they would do so if they were more widely available. The results of pill tests may influence drug use if they indicate that pills contain substances which ecstasy users do not want to ingest or are of unknown content.

Social anxiety is a condition characterized by fear of scrutiny and avoidance of social interactions. Social anxiety frequently compounds the considerable social challenges experienced by autistic adults. There are currently no FDA‐approved pharmacologic treatments for autistic adults, although off‐label prescription of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are on the rise in this population. Based on the known effects of MDMA, as well as individual reports from autistic adults, this exploratory study will focus on enhancing functional skills in this underserved population, who tend to experience greater anxiety, depression and victimization than typically developing adults. The main objective of this study is to collect safety data to examine whether MDMA‐assisted therapy will be tolerated and to estimate effect size of symptom reduction in social anxiety and other psychiatric symptoms that are common in the adult autistic population as evaluated by standard clinical measures. The primary outcome measure will be change in social anxiety levels as measured by the Lieberman Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS). Secondary measures include those of social anxiety, anxiety, depression, stress, self‐esteem, emotion labeling and recognition, empathy, and quality of life, and blood levels of the hormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. Each of the 12 subjects will participate in two blinded experimental sessions, assisted by either MDMA or placebo lasting seven hours within a brief course of non‐drug therapy. The non‐drug therapy includes three hour‐long preparatory sessions at the start of the study and three hour‐long integrative sessions during the month after each experimental session at two week intervals. This study is designed as a dose escalation study to assist with the exploration of safety and finding the most effective dose in this population. Subjects assigned to the MDMA group will receive two of three different doses, either 75mg, 100mg, or 125 mg MDMA. Overall, eight subjects (66.7%) will be randomized to the MDMA group and four subjects (33.3%) will be randomized to the placebo group. During the study, there will be a maximum of 24 experimental sessions with MDMA, with eight sessions in each dose group, and eight experimental sessions with placebo. Observations before, during, and after experimental sessions will be compared between these groups of equal size to explore the effects of MDMA‐assisted therapy in the first double The Principal Investigator will evaluate all subjects to confirm autistic status. In addition, autistic status will be confirmed with the gold‐standard diagnostic measure of autism in adults. Upon enrollment, subjects will meet with the study therapists for three 1‐hour preparatory sessions scheduled within the month prior to the first experimental session to discuss what to expect during experimental sessions. In‐person visits will occur in a private room at the research facility. All in‐person sessions will be video recorded. Video recordings will be used for research and training purposes after the study. During experimental sessions, there will be periods of structured and unstructured interactions. The structured interactions will be selected based on elements of therapeutic interventions that are currently in use in this population for the treatment of social anxiety. An overnight stay at a hotel located close to the site will be offered to subjects, accompanied by their support partners, if they live further than 30 miles from the site on the night following the experimental session. Subjects will attend a 1‐hour follow‐up integrative therapy session on the day after the experimental session. Two additional integrative sessions will be conducted two weeks apart following each experimental session. During integrative sessions subjects will receive support in integrating their experiences and insights from the experimental session. The second experimental ses ion will be scheduled approximately one month after the first experimental session, after outcome assessments have been completed. Biomarker levels will be analyzed to determine if MDMA‐assisted therapy causes changes in these modulators of social behavior in this population as previously demonstrated in typically developing adults. Biomarker levels will be analyzed for persisting effects at one month and 6 months after treatment. Blood samples will be obtained from all subjects to measure plasma OT, AVP and CORT, which will be used to explore as potential surrogate endpoints at baseline, two hours after drug administration during the second experimental session, one month after the second experimental session, and at 6‐month follow‐up.

Secondary outcome measures will look at the effect of psilocybin on symptoms of pain perception, depression, existential/psychospiritual distress, attitudes towards disease progression and death, quality of life, and spiritual/mystical states of consciousness. In addition, a secondary objective of the study is to determine the feasibility of administering psilocybin to this patient population, with regards to the following issues: safety, patient recruitment, consent for treatment, and retention. The duration of the proposed investigation will be long enough to administer the drug one time to each of thirty‐two patients and to conduct follow‐up assessments. This study is separate but similar to a recently completed study at the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor‐UCLA Medical Center, run by a psychiatrist, Dr. Charles Grob. Although the outcomes measures would be similar to those used as in the Grob study, the proposed dose of psilocybin is higher at 0.3mg/kg and the total subjects for the study would be 32 instead of 12.

The exact mechanism of action is unclear but based on studies done in the 60's using serotonergic hallucinogens in patients with advanced cancer, improvements in anxiety levels, mood and pain were reported. However, a treatment model developed by the famous British psychiatrist Humphrey Osmond, offers one possibility. In this model, serotonergic hallucinogens' therapeutic mechanism lies in their ability to allow the individual to access novel dimensions of consciousness and their efficacy or lack thereof relies on whether a transcendent and mystical state of awareness is attained. Another possible mechanism relates to what Dobkin de Rios and Grob have described as 'managed altered states of consciousness,' where the power of suggestibility, occurring in a safe setting, allows one to transcend a particular state of consciousness (i.e. anxiety and depression associated with advanced illness) as a means to facilitate emotional discharge and to manage irreconcilable conflict.", "doi": "", "pubmed_url": "", "secondary_title": "https://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00957359", "annotation": "Study Characteristics"}

Objective: To assess time trends in the prevalence of past-year nonmedical LSD use by past-year major depression status and the variation in this association by sociodemographic characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used pooled publicly available data from 478 492 adults aged 18 years or older who were administered the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 through 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 2022 to June 2023. Main Outcome and Measures: Past-year major depression diagnoses per criteria from the DSM-IV were analyzed. Logistic regression models examined whether time trends in past-year nonmedical LSD use differed between adults with vs without past-year depression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Secondary analyses examined whether the trends in LSD use by depression status differed between sociodemographic subgroups. Results: The analytic sample included 478 492 adults, of whom 51.8% were female, 56.1% were younger than 50 years, 11.7% were Black, 15.1% were Hispanic, 65.8% were White, and 7.5% were another race.

METHODS:: We studied 71 medically healthy recreational MDMA users and 62 control subjects using all-night sleep polysomnography in a controlled inpatient research setting. Rates of apneas, hypopneas, and apnea hypopnea indices were compared in the 2 groups, controlling for body mass index, age, race, and gender. RESULTS:: Recreational MDMA users who had been drug free for at least 2 weeks had significantly increased rates of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea compared with controls. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for sleep apnea (mild, moderate, and severe combined) in MDMA users during non-REM sleep was 8.5 (2.4-30.4), which was greater than that associated with obesity [6.9 (1.7-28.2)]. Severity of OSA was significantly related to lifetime MDMA exposure.

Rates of apneas, hypopneas, and apnea hypopnea indices were compared in the 2 groups, controlling for body mass index, age, race, and gender. RESULTS:: Recreational MDMA users who had been drug free for at least 2 weeks had significantly increased rates of obstructive sleep apnea and hypopnea compared with controls. The odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for sleep apnea (mild, moderate, and severe combined) in MDMA users during non-REM sleep was 8.5 (2.4-30.4), which was greater than that associated with obesity [6.9 (1.7-28.2)]. Severity of OSA was significantly related to lifetime MDMA exposure. CONCLUSIONS:: These findings suggest that prior recreational methylenedioxymethamphetamine use increases the risk for obstructive sleep apnea and lend support to the notion that brain serotonin neuronal dysfunction plays a role in the pathophysiology of sleep apnea. © 2009 by AAN Enterprises, Inc.", "doi": "10.1212/WNL.0b013e3181c51a62", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19955499/", "secondary_title": "Neurology", "annotation": "Substance(s)"}

RESULTS: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased IL-6 concentrations in saliva immediately post-session. These changes were not correlated to ratings of mental health or the psychedelic experience. Relative to baseline, ratings of non-judgment significantly increased, and ratings of depression decreased immediately post-session and at follow-up. Ratings of anxiety and stress decreased from baseline to 7-day follow-up. Participant ratings of the psychedelic experience correlated negatively with ratings of affect and positively with ratings of non-judgment. CONCLUSION: Inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced significant changes in inflammatory markers, improved affect, and non-judgment in volunteers.

However, scientific knowledge on the effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to assess the effects of inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine on neuroendocrine markers. The second objective was to assess effects of the substance on affect and mindfulness. In addition, we assessed whether ratings of subjective measures were associated with changes in stress biomarkers (i.e., cortisol) and immune response (i.e., IL-6, CRP, IL-1β), as well as the acute psychedelic experience. METHODS: Assessments (baseline, immediately post-session, and 7-day follow-up) were made in 11 participants. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and post-session and analyzed by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA).

It was delivered during health education classes over 4 weeks. Six schools were randomised to the control group (health education as usual). Participants were not blinded to intervention allocation. OUTCOMES MEASURES: Students completed self-report surveys at baseline, post-test, 6, 12 and 24 months post-baseline. Intentions to use ecstasy and NPS (including synthetic cannabis and synthetic stimulants), knowledge about ecstasy and NPS and lifetime use of ecstasy and NPS were assessed. This paper reports the results at 24 months post-baseline. ANALYSIS: Mixed effects regressions were conducted to analyse intervention effects from baseline to 24 months. Post hoc analyses using Inverse Probability of Treatment Weighting compared controls with students who: i) completed all four lessons ('full dose') and ii) partially completed the intervention (≤three lessons, 'incomplete dose'). RESULTS: Primary analyses found that controls were significantly more likely to intend on using synthetic cannabis compared with intervention group students (OR=3.56, p=0.01). Results from the weighted analyses indicated that controls reported significantly lower knowledge about ecstasy (p=0.001) and NPS (p=0.04) compared with the full-dose group. No significant differences were observed between the incomplete dose and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: The online intervention was effective in modifying students' intentions to use synthetic cannabis up to 24 months; however, this study highlights the importance of delivering prevention programmes in full to maximise student outcomes.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). METHODS: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. RESULTS: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h.

Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). METHODS: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. RESULTS: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h.
