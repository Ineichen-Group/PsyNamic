DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.", "doi": "10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00572.x", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/14678064/", "secondary_title": "Addiction"}

A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (\u03b2=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (\u03b2=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (\u03b2=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data.", "doi": "10.2196/25973", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34319246/", "secondary_title": "J Med Internet Res"}

II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate \"nonblind,\" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. \"Loss of control,\" associated with a brief, but overwhelming \"rush,\" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans.

However, how such feedback and feedforward connections are modulated in the state induced by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is poorly understood. In this study, an auditory oddball paradigm was presented to healthy participants (16 males, 4 female) under LSD and placebo, and brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Scalp level Event Related Fields (ERF) revealed reduced neural adaptation to familiar stimuli, and a blunted neural 'surprise' response to novel stimuli in the LSD condition. Dynamic causal modelling revealed that both the presentation of novel stimuli and LSD modulate backward extrinsic connectivity within a task-activated fronto-temporal network, as well as intrinsic connectivity in the primary auditory cortex. These findings show consistencies with those of previous studies of schizophrenia and ketamine but also studies of reduced consciousness - suggesting that rather than being a marker of conscious level per se, backward connectivity may index modulations of perceptual learning common to a variety of altered states of consciousness, perhaps united by a shared altered sensitivity to environmental stimuli. Since recent evidence suggests that the psychedelic state may correspond to a heightened 'level' of consciousness with respect to the normal waking state, our data warrant a re-examination of the top-down hypotheses of conscious level and suggest that several altered states may feature this specific biophysical effector.

The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, but much remains unknown about its mechanism of action. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to investigate how ketamine impacts brain activity during cognitive and emotional processing. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 33 unmedicated participants with MDD and 26 healthy controls (HCs) examined how ketamine affected fMRI activation during an attentional bias dot probe task with emotional face stimuli across multiple time points. A whole brain analysis was conducted to find regions with differential activation associated with group, drug session, or dot probe task-specific factors (emotional valence and congruency of stimuli). RESULTS: A drug session by group interaction was observed in several brain regions, such that ketamine had opposite effects on brain activation in MDD versus HC participants. Additionally, there was a similar finding related to emotional valence (a drug session by group by emotion interaction) in a large cluster in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a pattern of brain activity in MDD participants following ketamine infusion that is similar to activity observed in HCs after placebo. This suggests that ketamine may act as an antidepressant by normalizing brain function during emotionally valenced attentional processing.

The BPD-like subgroup also showed significant improvements on the DERS subscales emotional interference and lack of control but not in mindfulness capacities. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest a potential therapeutic effect for ayahuasca in emotion regulation and mindfulness capacities (including decentering, acceptance, awareness, and sensitivity to meditation practice).

(3) Results: Out of a total of 125,550 respondents, 8.4% reported using hallucinogens. Overall, the trend of hallucinogen use decreased from 13.3% (2001) to 7.0% (2019) (pTrend < 0.0001). Hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad and hopeless (aOR: 1.40; 95%CI: 1.21\u20131.61; p < 0.0001), considering suicide (aOR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.08\u20131.70; p = 0.009), and planning suicide (aOR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.19\u20131.86; p = 0.001). Additionally, adolescent hallucinogen users had a higher prevalence of alcohol, cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, synthetic marijuana, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy use. (4) Conclusions: The overall trend of hallucinogen use decreased among school-going American adolescents. We found a high prevalence of co-occurring substance use among hallucinogen users. We found that hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad, hopeless, and considering and planning suicide. Further research is needed to explore the effects of recreational hallucinogen use among the adolescent population.", "doi": "10.3390/children9121906", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36553349/", "secondary_title": "Children"}

However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 \u00b1 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 \u00b1 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (\u2265 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2017.06.043", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28666206/", "secondary_title": "J Affect Disord"}

OBJECTIVE: New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non-medical use. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30\u00a0mg/70\u00a0kg), DXM (400\u00a0mg/70\u00a0kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength. Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin: liking, visual effects, positive mood, insight, positive social effects, increased awareness of beauty (both visual and music), awe/amazement, meaningfulness, and mystical experience. For most ratings, (1) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo; (2) psilocybin showed dose-related increases; 3, DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin; (4) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM. These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects (alternatively described as the \"motivation\" to use).

The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.", "doi": "10.1055/s-2005-916185", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/16342002/", "secondary_title": "Pharmacopsychiatry"}

However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5\u00a0mg/kg and 0.2\u00a0mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression.

These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi\u2010structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within\u2010subject, double\u2010blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18\u201035 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in\u2010lab sessions separated by 72 hours.

Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs.

In controlled, outpatient research settings, ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts as early as 2\u201024 hours after a single infusion in patients with high suicide risk (Price 2014) ( Murrough 2015). In this IRB approved pilot study, we investigated ketamine\u2019s effects on suicidality in a real\u2010world sample of recent suicide attempters at imminent risk of suicide on a tertiary\u2010care Consultation\u2010Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Through administration of a \u201cpre\u2010treatment\u201d prior to psychiatric hospital transfer, we hypothesized ketamine would rapidly impact suicidal ideation in patients who attempted suicide and synergistically confer enduring benefits to behavioral therapies. Methods: In an open\u2010label design, we recruited 16 transdiagnostic patients,18\u201065 years old to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting, after CL consultation and informed consent. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post\u2010infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures [Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale, Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale, Adult Suicide Ideation Questionnaire, hopelessness (via Cognitive Triad Inventory)] were compared to 24\u2010hours, 5\u2010days, 12\u2010days, and 1\u2010 and 3\u2010months post\u2010infusion using paired t\u2010tests. Results: Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p\u2019s<.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen\u2019s d\u2019s: 1.7\u20108.8) at acute timepoints (24\u2010hour; 5\u2010day). These large gains were also uniformly maintained during follow\u2010up, continuously out to 3\u2010months post\u2010infusion. Discussion: Ketamine rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra\u2010high\u2010risk, heterogeneous, \u201creal world\u201d sample. Combined with standard care, ketamine might also synergistically enhance the durability of benefit observed following discharge, consistent with a growing literature examining ketamine as a pre\u2010treatment to behavioral therapies ( Dakwar 2020). In forthcoming analyses, we will compare 6\u2010 and 12\u2010month rates of suicide re\u2010attempt and re\u2010hospitalization in ketamine\u2010treated patients to a matched case\u2010control sample of suicide attempters who did not receive ketamine pre\u2010treatment. Conclusion/Implications: Ketamine infusion is a safe, feasible, and viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among patients admitted to the medical hospital after suicide attempt, and could also have enduring benefits. By advancing knowledge of novel treatment methods in real\u2010world clinical services through completion of further studies, ketamine could become an important and novel tool in the treatment of high\u2010risk CL patients.

S-ketamine given intravenously during surgery can help prevent PPD. However, whether S-ketamine in patient-controlled intravenous analgesia (PCIA) can reduce the incidence of PPD is unknown. This study assessed the effect of S-ketamine as an adjuvant in PCIA for preventing PPD in women undergoing cesarean delivery. METHODS: A total of 375 parturients scheduled to undergo cesarean section and then receive PCIA were recruited from a single center and were randomly assigned to control (C) group (sufentanil 2\u2009\u03bcg/kg\u2009+\u2009tropisetron 10\u2009mg) or S-ketamine (S) group (S-ketamine 0.5\u2009mg/kg\u2009+\u2009sufentanil 2\u2009\u03bcg/kg\u2009+\u2009tropisetron 10\u2009mg). The primary outcome was the incidence of PPD measured by the Edinburgh postnatal depression scale (EPDS) after surgery. The secondary outcomes were EPDS scores, visual analog scale (VAS) scores, Ramsay sedation scale (RSS) scores, and the rate of adverse events, including headache, nausea, dizziness, drowsiness, and vomit. RESULTS: A total of 275 puerperal women were included in the study. The rate of depression in parturient on postoperative days 3, 14, 28 in the C group and S group were 17.6 and 8.2% (p\u2009<\u20090.05), 24.2 and 9.8% (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 19.0 and 17.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.76) respectively. EPDS scores in the C group and S group on postoperative days 3,14, and 28 were 7.65\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 and 6.00\u2009\u00b1\u20092.47 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), 7.62\u2009\u00b1\u20093.14 and 6.38\u2009\u00b1\u20092.67 (p\u2009<\u20090.05), and 7.35\u2009\u00b1\u20093.17 and 6.90\u2009\u00b1\u20092.78 (p\u2009=\u20090.15), respectively. The rate of adverse events in the C group and S group were headache 3.3 and 4.1% (p\u2009=\u20090.755), nausea 5.9 and 8.2% (p\u2009=\u20090.481), dizziness 9.2 and 12.3% (p\u2009=\u20090.434), drowsiness 6.5 and 10.7%(p\u2009=\u20090.274), and vomit 5.9 and 5.7% (p\u2009=\u20090.585).

There are numerous media reports that doses of LSD about 1/10th of typical tripping doses, taken at 3\u20104\u2010 day intervals, improve mood and cognition. However, these effects have been difficult to demonstrate under placebocontrolled conditions. Methods: We conducted a double\u2010blind controlled study examining effects of repeated doses of LSD (13 or 26 \u03bcg) or placebo, in healthy adults. Participants were randomly assigned to receive placebo (N = 18), 13 \u03bcg LSD (N = 19), or 26 \u03bcg LSD(N = 19) during four 5\u2010hour laboratory sessions, separated by 3\u20104 days.

Results: LSD produced small increases in ratings of 'feeling a drug effect', including both stimulant\u2010like and LSD\u2010like effects, especially during the first administration of the drug. The drug produced few effects on emotion or psychomotor tasks or measures of heart rate or pressure, and no residual effects were detected on the drug\u2010free followup session. Conclusions: We conclude that repeated low doses of LSD are safe and that the repeated dosing design is feasible for future studies, but under these conditions the drug produces negligible changes in mood or cognition.

While, these effects were similar across psychedelic classes and the dissociative ketamine, LSD was most potent. Additional experiments with DMT also showed these morphological changes, even after the administration of low DMT doses that are considered to be sub\u2010hallucinogenic. The latter is important in light of the increased scientific interest in using low psychedelic doses, also known as 'microdosing'. Despite preclinical evidence for psychedelic\u2010induced neuroplasticity, confirmation in humans is grossly lacking. Given the interest in brain\u2010derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) as a key player in several neurodegenerative andneuropsychiatric disorders, and the preclinical data showing psychedelics\u2010induced neuroplasticity, even in low doses of psychedelics, the present, double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled, within\u2010subjects study aimed to investigate whether LSD in low doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 mcg) affects BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers. Methods: Participants were recreational psychedelic users (N=24, both sexes) who provided informed consent, fell within the inclusion criteria, and passed medical screening including standard blood chemistry, hematology, and urinalysis, prior to inclusion. Test days were scheduled with minimally five days in between. LSD (5, 10, and 20 mcg LSD base, dissolved in 96% Vol ethanol) or placebo (1 mL of ethanol) was administered orally in the morning (10:00 AM). Blood samples were collected every two hours over a six\u2010hour period, and BDNF levels were determined afterwards in blood plasma using ELISA. Difficulties with the peripheral venous catheter during blood sample collection resulted in missing data. Four trapezoidal areas under the curve (AUC) were calculated for the three LSD doses and placebo. The study adhered to the code of ethics on human experimentation, it was approved by the Medical Ethics Committee of the Academic Hospital of Maastricht and Maastricht University, and registered in the Dutch Clinical Trial register (number: NTR7102 https://www.trialregister.nl/). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. Complete within\u2010subjects cases (N(5 mcg)=10; N(10 mcg)= 9; N (20 mcg)=8) entered statistical analyses. Non\u2010parametric Wilcoxon signed\u2010rank (S\u2010R) tests for related samples (placebo versus LSD dose) were conducted on BDNF AUC's, and on BDNF plasma levels at \u20100.5h, +2h, +4h and +6h after dose administration of 5, 10 and 20 mcg LSD. Separate Friedman tests per treatment condition were performed to test at which timepoint LSD differed statistically from placebo. In case of a main effect Dunn's tests for pairwise comparisons including baseline versus 2h, 4h, and 6h, 2h\u20104h, and 4h\u20106h were conducted. Effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) are given in case of statistically significant effects at alpha= 0.05. The alpha level was corrected for multiple comparisons with sequential Bonferroni in case of Dunn's tests. Results: Wilcoxon Signed\u2010Rank (S\u2010R) tests revealed a statistically significant difference between AUC BDNF levels following 5 (Z= \u20102.60, p= 0.009, r= 0.58, 95% CI [0.11\u20101.06]) and 20 mcg LSD (Z= \u20102.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09\u20101.17]) compared to placebo; the difference between AUC BDNF levels after 10 mcg LSD and placebo was not significant (Z= \u20101.01, p=0.31). Wilcoxon S\u2010R tests revealed higher BDNF levels at +4h after administration of 5 (Z= \u20102.80, p< 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.15\u20101.11]) and 10 mcg LSD (Z= \u20101.95, p= 0.05, r= 0.46, 95% [\u20100.04\u20100.97]) compared to placebo. The latter CI included zero, indicating non\u2010significance. Tests at +6h after LSD administration revealed significant effects of 5 (Z= \u20102.29, p= 0.02, = 0.51, 95% CI [0.03\u20100.99]) and 20 mcg (Z= \u20102.52, p= 0.01, r= 0.63, 95% CI [0.09\u20101.17]) LSD compared to placebo. Friedman tests investigating BDNF changes in function of time demonstrated that BDNF plasma levels remained stable in the placebo conditions throughout the test frame. BDNF plasma levels in the LSD conditions showed their highest levels at four hours after administration of 5 mcg LSD (8.95 ng/mL), and at 6 hours after administration of 10 mcg (8.28 ng/mL) and 20 mcg of LSD (11 49 ng/mL). Conclusions: This study provides preliminary evidence that low doses of LSD increase BDNF plasma levels in healthy volunteers up to 6 hours after administration, suggesting a window of opportunity for therapeutic response and/or and cognitive enhancement that might be of use in patient populations. This line of thinking is supported by recent findings with ketamine and ayahuasca (containing the psychedelic DMT) demonstrating increased serum BDNF levels respectively 24 and 48 hours after a single dose, compared to placebo, which was related to fast antidepressant actions. Besides emphasizing the need to sample BDNF beyond the elimination stage, in addition to including behavioral and/or imaging measures, future studies could focus on similarities between underlying biological pathways of the well\u2010studied ketamine, and LSD, as it will contribute to understanding the scope of effects LSD, might have, based on ketamine findings.", "doi": "10.1038/s41386-020-00892-5", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33279936/", "secondary_title": "Neuropsychopharmacology"}

However, uncertainty remains in several areas: dose response, consistency across patient groups, effects on suicidality, and possible biases arising from crossover trials. METHODS: A systematic search was conducted for relevant randomized trials in Medline, Embase, and PsycINFO databases up to August 2014. The primary endpoints were change in depression scale scores at days 1, 3 and 7, remission, response, suicidality, safety, and tolerability. Data were independently abstracted by 2 reviewers. Where possible, unpublished data were obtained on treatment effects in the first period of crossover trials. RESULTS: Nine trials were identified, including 201 patients (52% female, mean age 46 years). Six trials assessed low-dose ketamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v.) and 3 tested very low-dose ketamine (one trial assessed 50 mg intra-nasal spray, another assessed 0.1-0.4 mg/kg i.v., and another assessed 0.1-0.5 mg/kg i.v., intramuscular, or s.c.). At day 3, the reduction in depression severity score was less marked in the very low-dose trials (P homogeneity <.05) and among bipolar patients. In analyses excluding the second period of crossover trials, response rates at day 7 were increased with ketamine (relative risk 3.4, 95% CI 1.6-7.1, P=.001), as were remission rates (relative risk 2.6, CI 1.2-5.7, P=.02). The absolute benefits were large, with day 7 remission rates of 24% vs 6% (P=.02). Seven trials provided unpublished data on suicidality item scores, which were reduced on days 1 and 3 (both P<.01) but not day 7. CONCLUSION: Low-dose ketamine appears more effective than very low dose. There is substantial heterogeneity in clinical response, with remission among one-fifth of patients at 1 week but most others having benefits that are less durable. Larger, longer term parallel group trials are needed to determine if efficacy can be extended and to further assess safety.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyv124", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26578082/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Pre and post guideline, all patients were treated in a symptom-triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital. Postguideline, standard symptom-triggered dosing continued as preguideline, plus, the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15-0.3\u2009mg/kg/hr continuously until delirium resolved. Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation, a ketamine bolus (0.3\u2009mg/kg) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included (29 preguideline; 34 postguideline). Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated (odds ratio, 0.14; p < 0.01; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days (95% CI, -5.58 to -0.089; p = 0.043). For ICU days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for alcohol level and total benzodiazepine dosing. For hospital days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for patient age, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase level.

Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6\u2009days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4\u2009weeks of follow-up.

However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n\u2009=\u200925) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.", "doi": "10.1093/ijnp/pyad006", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36789509/", "secondary_title": "Int J Neuropsychopharmacol"}

However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300).

We hypothesized that the proportion of individuals with positive urine drug test results presenting at the psychiatric emergency department during the study period would be 20% to 30%. Methods: An unselected cohort of 2,019 adult patients who visited the emergency department of Sha'ar Menashe Mental Health Center, a university-affiliated government facility, was evaluated and underwent routine urine drug testing between April 2012 and February 2014. Clinical, demographic, and urine drug test data were collected from medical records and statistically analyzed, comparing diagnostic evaluation at admission and after discharge from either the emergency department or the hospital. Univariate and logistic regression analyses were used to identify the possible variables associated with drug use in this sample. Results: Urine drug test results showed that 194 of the 2,019 subjects (9.6%) had used a psychoactive substance before attending the emergency department. Among patients with positive urine drug test results, the majority (77.8%) used cannabis, 25.8% used opiates, 24.7% used ecstasy, and 5.2% used cocaine.

Both univariate and logistic regression analyses revealed that younger age (18\u201340), male sex, fewer years of education, single marital status, and ICD-10 diagnosis of substance-related, personality, and nonpsychotic disorders were indicators of higher likelihood of positive urine drug test findings. Conclusions: Results suggest that routine urine toxicology screening is not necessary in the psychiatric emergency department as an adjunct to a thorough psychiatric clinical examination.

Methods: Secondary analysis of randomized, double\u2010blind placebo controlled trial of treatment\u2010resistant unipolar depression (18\u201065, MADRS\u226522) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and randomized to double\u2010blind treatment with riluzole (100\u2010200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. Results: Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine (p=.02). In subjects randomized to placebo, the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response (p=.002). There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole (p=.88).

Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism (p=.04). Past personal history had no main effect (p=.057). Conclusions: Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history.

All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump. Randomization will be performed in blocks, ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine. Crossing between the blocks will be performed, so that all patients receive both interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned into two distinct groups through a list of random numbers, keeping allocation concealment preserved. Regarding masking, the same investigator responsible for the allocation will prepare the drugs. Study solutions will be provided in identical 50mL syringes containing midazolam or escetamine with the additional volume of saline solution for a total of 50mL. Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline, making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection. The active placebo used, midazolam, is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms, that is, it does not worsen and does not treat. It is a short\u2010acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action, a short elimination half\u2010life, and a similar time course of dissociative and non\u2010specific behavioral effects (eg, sedation, disorientation) to escetamine, thus providing adequate blinding ( Shiroma, 2020). Such medication is widely used in clinical trials (Peyrovian, 2020; Dakwar, 2020; Rothberg, 2020), with data in the literature proving the safety of its use in OCD patients (Bloch 2012, Rodriguez 2017).

It is expected to find a significant reduction, i.e. greater than or equal to 35% in the total score on the Yale\u2010Brown Obsessive\u2010Compulsive Scale. A mixed linear fixed effects model will be used to examine the differences between esketamine and midazolam treatment. A composite symmetry covariance structure appears to be the best fit to the data. The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data. Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests. Significance is assessed at P < 0.05, two\u2010tailed. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To assess changes from baseline scores for 24h, 7, and 14 days after each infusion in the placebo and control groups on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity and Improvement and the Montgomery\u2010Asberg Depression Rating Scale. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the change in the Yale\u2010Brown Obsessive\u2010Compulsive Scale total score before each infusion to 7 and 14 days after the procedure between the placebo group and the control group.

Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities. Within the range of observation, co-administration did not affect the changes in mood or recall.

It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged \u226565 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for \u22653 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine.", "doi": "10.1213/ane.0000000000005875", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35051953/", "secondary_title": "Anesth Analg"}

Employing a combination of electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings and quantification of ayahuasca's compounds and their metabolites in the systemic circulation we found ayahua-sca to induce a biphasic effect in the brain.

A number of studies have reported that ecstasy users differ from controls on a variety of measures of cognitive function. However, the literature is not consistent and many negative findings were also reported. One reason for such inconsistency might be interindividual variance in vulnerability to the deleterious effects of ecstasy due to a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that carriers of the s allele at the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which was associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission relative to the l allele, would be most vulnerable to the effects of ecstasy on cognitive function. Methods: We assessed memory, decision-making, and executive function in ecstasy users and controls, stratifying by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR. Results: We observed that the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups differed on a number of measures in both the ecstasy users and the controls. While performing a risky decision-making task, ss and ls controls attended to differences in the probability of winning chosen gambles to a greater extent than the ll controls. However, this difference was dramatically attenuated in the ss ecstasy users. Furthermore, independent of ecstasy use, volunteers of the ss genotype outperformed the ll genotype on a visual planning task.

The authors compared mood and regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) profiles between regular polytoxic Ecstasy users and Ecstasy-na\u00efve controls. Brain activity as indexed by rCBF was measured during cognitive activation by an attentional task using positron emission tomography and [H215O].

Statistical parametric mapping revealed that brain activity did not differ between the two groups. Both groups also performed equally on the cognitive task requiring sustained attention.

Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for major abdominal surgery and is shown to have superior analgesia when compared to systemic analgesia[i]. However, its use is controversial[ii]. Lidocaine and ketamine both are being used for perioperative analgesia. Perioperative lidocaine infusion has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption[iii]. Perioperative low dose Ketamine has shown improved postoperative pain and reduced opioid usage[iv]. , therefore,re tested the hypothesis that the combination would provide better analgesia in the milieu of intrathecal morphine. Methods: After institutional ethics approval and written informed consent, we randomized 124 adult ASA 1\u20104 patients scheduled for open liver resection to one of four groups. Intraoperatively, group L received lidocaine infusion, group K received ketamine infusion, group LK received lidocaine and ketamine infusion and group P received saline infusion. All patients received 300 mics intrathecal morphine prior to induction of standardized anesthesia and all infusions were started immediately after the intubation and continued until the end of surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received hydromorphone via a PCA device and its consumption recorded for 3 days. Data regarding other side effects was also recorded. Primary outcome measurements included pain scores and opioid consumption at 24 hrs. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and opioid consumption at 48 and 72 hrs and side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headaches and signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Data analysis included 113 patients. There was no difference in pain scores within all 4 groups at rest or movement at 24 hrs. Mean 48 hrs rest pain scores were 3.1, 1.7, 2.3 and 1.7 in L, K, KL and P groups respectively (p<0.03 between groups, unadjusted for multiple testing procedures). Pain scores were not significantly different at all other time points. All opioids were converted to morphine equivalents. Opioid use was less in ketamine group at 48 hrs but did not reach statistical significance. The total 72 hr use was not significantly different across the groups. There was no difference in side effects between the groups at any time points. Conclusions: In this triple blind, parallel group four\u2010arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trial, lidocaine, ketamine or their combination did not add any benefit over single dose intrathecal morphine with patient controlled hydromorphone analgesia.

METHODS: A systematic search of PubMed and Scopus from inception to August 2021 was conducted. Where applicable, the studies were categorized into low and high stages of resistance, where low category included studies where the mean number of failed antidepressants was <3 or had a higher proportion of subjects with \u22642 antidepressant trials.

RESULTS: In total, 18 RCTs were included in the current review. There was variability across reported indicators of disease severity, definition of treatment resistance, as well as treatment protocols, preventing clear direct and indirect comparison of relative efficacy of ketamine at different stages of treatment resistance. Ketamine was effective in reducing depressive symptoms in RCTs at both lower and higher stages of treatment resistance; however, the effect size and duration of effects was greater in RCTs of lower stage of treatment resistance. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings suggested that ketamine has antidepressant efficacy across all identified stages of treatment resistance, however with increasing failed treatment trials, treatment might be less efficacious.

This study was conducted to examine the efficacy and tolerability of six ketamine infusions in Chinese patients with unipolar and bipolar depression. Methods: Ninety seven patients with unipolar (n = 77) and bipolar (n = 20) depression received repeated ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) with continuous vital sign monitoring.

Historically and contemporarily, psychedelic studies have emphasized the importance of contextual elements ('set and setting') in modulating acute drug effects, and ultimately, influencing long-term outcomes. Nevertheless, current small-scale clinical and laboratory studies have tended to bypass a ubiquitous contextual feature of naturalistic psychedelic use: its social dimension. This study introduces and psychometrically validates an adapted Communitas Scale, assessing acute relational experiences of perceived togetherness and shared humanity, in order to investigate psychosocial mechanisms pertinent to psychedelic ceremonies and retreats. Methods: In this observational, web-based survey study, participants (N = 886) were measured across five successive time-points: 2\u00a0weeks before, hours before, and the day after a psychedelic ceremony; as well as the day after, and 4\u00a0weeks after leaving the ceremony location. Demographics, psychological traits and state variables were assessed pre-ceremony, in addition to changes in psychological wellbeing and social connectedness from before to after the retreat, as primary outcomes. Using correlational and multiple regression (path) analyses, predictive relationships between psychosocial 'set and setting' variables, communitas, and long-term outcomes were explored. Results: The adapted Communitas Scale demonstrated substantial internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.92) and construct validity in comparison with validated measures of intra-subjective (visual, mystical, challenging experiences questionnaires) and inter-subjective (perceived emotional synchrony, identity fusion) experiences. Furthermore, communitas during ceremony was significantly correlated with increases in psychological wellbeing (r = 0.22), social connectedness (r = 0.25), and other salient mental health outcomes. Path analyses revealed that the effect of ceremony-communitas on long-term outcomes was fully mediated by communitas experienced in reference to the retreat overall, and that the extent of personal sharing or 'self-disclosure' contributed to this process. A positive relationship between participants and facilitators, and the perceived impact of emotional support, facilitated the emergence of communitas. Conclusion: Highlighting the importance of intersubjective experience, rapport, and emotional support for long-term outcomes of psychedelic use, this first quantitative examination of psychosocial factors in guided psychedelic settings is a significant step toward evidence-based benefit-maximization guidelines for collective psychedelic use.", "doi": "10.3389/fphar.2021.623985", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33995022/", "secondary_title": "Front Pharmacol"}

However, it is not known how MDMA interacts with components of the therapeutic process to produce its beneficial effects. We tested the effects of MDMA on four measures of social experience to elucidate the behavioral components that underlie the efficacy of MDMA in combination with psychotherapy. Methods: Healthy volunteers participated in two double\u2010blind placebo\u2010controlled studies using a within\u2010subjects crossover design. In Study 1 (N=36), they received MDMA (0.75mg/kg and 1.5mg/kg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. In Study 2 (N=18 of 36), they received MDMA (125mg), methamphetamine (20mg), and placebo. During peak drug effect, they completed standardized tasks assessing social behavior. These tasks included a social attention bias task, an emotional response to social feedback task, an affective touch task, and a verbal task assessing synchrony of vocal pitch during a social interaction. Results: MDMA (1.5mg/kg) increased attention to faces expressing positive emotions compared to neutral faces (p<0.05). During the social feedback task, MDMA dose\u2010dependently increased feelings of social acceptance following all types of social feedback (p<0.05), and similarly increased pleasantness ratings of affective touch (p<0.05). Methamphetamine did not produce these effects. Conclusions: These findings build on previous reports that MDMA reduces responses to negative social stimuli by showing that the drug also enhances responses to positive social stimuli. The facilitatory effects of MDMA on social acceptance, affective touch, and attention to positive emotions may improve the patient\u2010therapist connection. Further studies are needed to extend these findings to clinical populations.

AIMS: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. METHODS: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24\u2009hours later, and 2\u2009hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48\u2009hours after extinction training. Participants (N\u2009=\u200934; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100\u2009mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (\u03c7(2)\u2009=\u20097.29, p\u2009=\u20090.007).

Animal models suggest a pronounced effect on ventral 'limbic' FST systems, although recent work in patients with psychosis and high-risk individuals suggests specific alterations of dorsal 'associative' FST circuits. Here, we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to investigate the effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on measures of functional connectivity as indexed by the temporal coherence of spontaneous neural activity in both dorsal and ventral FST circuits, as well as their symptom correlates. We adopted a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, repeated-measures design in which 19 healthy participants received either an intravenous saline infusion or a racemic mixture of ketamine (100 ng/ml) separated by at least I week Compared with placebo, ketamine increased functional connectivity between the dorsal caudate and both the thalamus and midbrain bilaterally. Ketamine additionally increased functional connectivity of the ventral striatum/nucleus accumbens and ventromedial prefrontal cortex. Both connectivity increases significantly correlated with the psychosis-like and dissociative symptoms under ketamine. Importantly, dorsal caudate connectivity with the ventrolateral thalamus and subthalamic nucleus showed inverse correlation with ketamine-induced symptomatology, pointing to a possible resilience role to disturbances in FST circuits. Although consistent with the role of FST in mediating psychosis, these findings contrast with previous research in clinical samples by suggesting that acute NMDAR antagonism may lead to psychosis-like experiences via a mechanism that is distinct from that implicated in frank psychotic illness.

Loss of Meaning (LoM), a component of demoralization, can be elevated by a cancer diagnosis and predicts DHD and SI in this population. We completed a randomized controlled trial in which psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP) produced rapid and sustained improvements in depression, demoralization, and hopelessness in people with cancer. Converging epidemiologic and clinical trial findings suggests a potential antisuicidal effect of this treatment. To probe our hypothesis that PAP relieves SI through its beneficial impacts on depression and demoralization (LoM in particular), we performed secondary analyses assessing within- and between-group differences with regard to LoM and an SI composite score. Among participants with elevated SI at baseline, PAP was associated with within-group reductions in SI that were apparent as early as 8 h and persisted for 6.5 months postdosing. PAP also produced large reductions in LoM from baseline that were apparent 2 weeks after treatment and remained significant and robust at the 6.5 month and 3.2 and 4.5 year follow-ups. Exploratory analyses support our hypothesis and suggest that PAP may be an effective antisuicidal intervention following a cancer diagnosis due to its positive impact on hopelessness and demoralization and its effects on meaning-making in particular.

It is unknown to what extent this mechanism is also responsible for the physiological side-effects of MDMA seen in humans.

In addition, MDMA is a potent releaser and reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin. Objective: To assess the differential effects of MDMA and hallucinogen use on cerebral serotonin transporter (SERT) and serotonin 2A receptor binding. Design: A positron emission tomography study of 24 young adult drug users and 21 nonusing control participants performed with carbon 11 (11C)-labeled 3-amino-4-[2-[(di(methyl)amino)methyl]phenyl] sulfanylbenzonitrile (DASB) and fluorine 18 (18F)-labeled altanserin, respectively. Scans were performed in the user group after a minimum drug abstinence period of 11 days, and the group was subdivided into hallucinogen-preferring users (n=10) and MDMA-preferring users (n=14). Participants: Twenty-four young adult users ofMDMA and/or hallucinogenic drugs and 21 nonusing controls. Main Outcome Measures: In vivo cerebral SERT and serotonin2A receptor binding. Results: Compared with nonusers, MDMA-preferring users showed significant decreases in SERT nondisplaceable binding potential (neocortex, -56%; pallidostriatum, -19%; and amygdala, -32%); no significant changes were seen in hallucinogen-preferring users. Both cortical and pallidostriatal SERT nondisplaceable binding potential was negatively correlated with the number of lifetime MDMA exposures, and the time of abstinence from MDMA was positively correlated with subcortical, but not cortical, SERT binding. A small decrease in neocortical serotonin2A receptor binding in the serotonin2A receptor agonist users (both user groups) was also detected. Conclusions: We found evidence that MDMA but not hallucinogen use is associated with changes in the cerebral presynaptic serotonergic transmitter system. Because hallucinogenic drugs primarily have serotonin2A receptor agonistic actions, we conclude that the negative association between MDMA use and cerebral SERT binding is mediated through a direct presynaptic MDMA effect rather than by the serotonin2A agonistic effects of MDMA. Our cross-sectional data suggest that subcortical, but not cortical, recovery of SERT binding might take place after several months of MDMA abstinence. \u00a92011 American Medical Association.

It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2023-66698-001[/rid]). Ketamine is an effective intervention for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), including late-in-life (LL-TRD). The proposed mechanism of antidepressant effects of ketamine is a glutamatergic surge, which can be measured by electroencephalogram (EEG) gamma oscillations. Yet, non-linear EEG biomarkers of ketamine effects such as neural complexity are needed to capture broader systemic effects, represent the level of organization of synaptic communication, and elucidate mechanisms of action for treatment responders. In a secondary analysis of a randomized control trial, we investigated two EEG neural complexity markers (Lempel-Ziv complexity [LZC] and multiscale entropy [MSE]) of rapid (baseline to 240 min) and post-rapid ketamine (24 h and 7 days) effects after one 40-min infusion of IV ketamine or midazolam (active control) in 33 military veterans with LL-TRD. We also studied the relationship between complexity and Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating Scale score change at 7 days post-infusion. We found that LZC and MSE both increased 30 min post-infusion, with effects not localized to a single timescale for MSE. Post-rapid effects of reduced complexity with ketamine were observed for MSE. No relationship was observed between complexity and reduction in depressive symptoms. Our findings support the hypothesis that a single sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion has time-varying effects on system-wide contributions to the evoked glutamatergic surge in LL-TRD. Further, changes to complexity were observable outside the time-window previously shown for effects on gamma oscillations. These preliminary results have clinical implications in providing a functional marker of ketamine that is non-linear, amplitude-independent, and represents larger dynamic properties, providing strong advantages over linear measures in highlighting ketamine\u2019s effects.

New studies have recommended combination therapy to reduce the side effects of ketamine. OBJECTIVES: This study investigated the effect of adding intravenous (IV) lidocaine to ketamine on hemodynamic parameters, endoscopist satisfaction, and recovery time of children undergoing gastrointestinal endoscopy. METHODS: This triple-blind, randomized, controlled clinical trial was conducted in Isfahan, Iran (2021). One hundred twenty children between the ages of 1 and 6 were enrolled. Patients were divided into 2 groups. The intervention group received 1.0 mg/kg of IV lidocaine and 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine, and the placebo group received 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine and placebo 2 minutes before entering the endoscopic room. Patients in both groups were sedated with 1.0 mg/kg of propofol, 0.1 mg/kg of midazolam, and 2.0 ug/kg of fentanyl for the procedure.

Existing treatment efficacy is moderate, and relapse rates are high. Preliminary findings suggest that psilocybin, a psychedelic compound, can safely and reliably occasion highly meaningful experiences that may spur a positive change in drinking behaviour when administered in a therapeutic context. However, the efficacy of a single psilocybin administration and its potential neurobiological underpinnings still remain unknown. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: To establish efficacy, we will investigate the effects of psilocybin-assisted therapy versus placebo in a randomised, double-blinded, placebo-controlled 12-week clinical trial. Ninety treatment-seeking patients, aged 20-70 years, diagnosed with alcohol use disorder will be recruited from the community via advertisement and referrals from general practitioners or specialised treatment units. The psilocybin or placebo will be administered in accordance with a protocol for psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks postdosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow-up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes are as follows: (1) total alcohol consumption, (2) phosphatidyl-ethanol, an objective biomarker for alcohol, (3) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range, (4) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome and (5) neuronal response to alcohol cues and cognitive flexibility within corticostriatal pathways by use of functional MR brain imaging 1-week postdosing.

To this end, we investigated the patterns of use and the subjectively perceived acute and persisting effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline, among Danish adults. METHODS: An anonymous online survey with 152 items was conducted using the secure survey web application REDCap. Results were presented descriptively and as comparisons between psychedelic drugs. RESULTS: Five-hundred participants (30.0% female, mean age 34.5\u00a0years) were included. Classic psychedelics were mostly used with therapeutic (28.0%) or spiritual (27.2%) intentions. Sixty-seven per cent used classic psychedelics once a year or less. Most participants (56.4%) preferred using psilocybin. Classic psychedelic use was for some individuals, associated with hazardous use of alcohol (39.4%). Among participants with a psychiatric treatment history, 80.9% reported subjective improvements in symptoms following classic psychedelic use.

Less is known about the effects of a history of MDMA use on aspects of everyday cognitive functioning-of which prospective memory (typically characterised as 'remembering to do something at some future point') is an important aspect. Self-ratings of prospective memory among 30 regular ecstasy users (taking the drug 10 or more times per month) and 31 ecstasy-free controls were compared. Each participant completed the Prospective Memory Questionnaire, which measures self-rated error frequencies relating to three aspects of prospective memory (short-term habitual, long-term episodic and internally cued); the scale also records the use of strategies to aid remembering. Compared with non-users, ecstasy users reported significantly more self-rated errors in prospective memory, and effect which was evident after co-varying levels of other drug use. There were no significant differences in the use of strategies to aid memory. These findings provide new insights into prospective memory dysfunction in recreational drug users. Prospective memory deficits may be related to the reported serotonergic and frontal lobe deficits in chronic MDMA users. It is necessary to use more objective tasks to assess putative prospective memory deficits in ecstasy users.

Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin\u2019s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1\u201385 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects.

This occurs shortly after admission to the Labor and Delivery Unit. Women who agree to participate will give written, informed consent at this time. Subjects will be prepared preoperatively in the usual fashion with intravenous (IV) access, aspiration prophylaxis and intraoperative monitoring. Preincision antibiotics will be given and uterotonic medications will be used as per usual practice after delivery. The anesthesiologist will perform a spinal anesthetic per routine with the subject in the sitting position using sterile technique at the L3\u20104 interspace (\u00b1 one vertebral interspace). The spinal anesthetic will consist of 12 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine + 15 \u03bcg fentanyl + 150 \u03bcg of morphine. The subject will be placed supine with left lateral tilt to alleviate aortocaval compression. Cesarean section will commence after adequate anesthesia is assured to a T4 sensory level to pinprick. Vasopressors and IV fluids will be administered at the anesthesiologist's discretion per usual practice. At the time of delivery, subjects will be randomized to one of two groups using a computer generated random number table. Randomization will be blocked based on whether the cesarean procedure is a primary or a repeat procedure. Randomization assignments will be kept in sequentially numbered opaque envelopes. The envelope will be opened by a research nurse who will prepare a 20 mL syringe labeled \"study drug\". The syringe will be given to the anesthesiologist blinded to the treatment group who will subsequently administer the study drug. Subjects randomized to the treatment group will receive ketamine 10 mg (ketamine 10 mg/mL) diluted to 20 mL with 0.9% preservative free saline. Subjects randomized to the placebo group will receive 20 mL preservative free saline. The study drug will be administered into the intravenous line via an infusion pump over 10 minutes. Five minutes after placebo or drug administration, the anesthesiologist will ask the subject if she has nausea, vomiting and pruritus. Nausea and pruritus will be graded as none, mild, moderate or severe; and vomiting as present or absent. Any spontaneous complaints of psychedelic effects will be noted at this time. Sedation will be assessed via the Richmond agitation\u2010sedation scale (RASS [see Appendix 1]). Upon completion of the cesarean section, the subject will be transported to the post anesthesia recovery unit.

At 1 h, 4 h, 8 h, 12 h and at 24 h after administration of the study drug, the subject's pain will be assessed using the numeric rating scale for pain NRS 0\u201010 (see Appendix 2). Patients may request rescue analgesia if they are experiencing discomfort. The time of first rescue analgesia request will be noted, and the NRS will be determined at the time of request for rescue analgesia. Rescue medication will consist of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg per os. An additional dose of hydrocodone 10 mg plus acetaminophen 325 mg will be provided after 1 hour if the pain is not relieved to the subject's satisfaction. These are routine oral analgesic medications for postoperative cesarean delivery analgesia. Standard orders will be written for monitoring sedation and respiratory rate, and treatment of side effects (nausea, vomiting, pruritus and respiratory depression). The total amount of rescue medication will be determined for each subject after 24, 48 and 72 hours.

These questions will be administered verbally by the anesthesiologist or researcher blinded to the treatment group upon admission to the PACU and at 4 h. The following data will be collected in addition to the primary and secondary outcome data: maternal age, height, weight, prepregnancy weight, gestational age and IV fluids administered during cesarean section. In addition, all intraoperative and postoperative medications will be recorded, including those administered for the treatment of side effects listed above. Protocol specific analgesia assessment ends 24 hours after administration of the study drug. At 72 hours the subject will be asked about her satisfaction with postoperative analgesia (100 mm scale, 0 mm = not satisfied at all, 100 mm = very satisfied).

We investigated the status of brain 5-HT neurons in MDMA users. METHODS: We enrolled 14 previous users of MDMA who were currently abstaining from use and 15 controls who had never used MDMA. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand carbon-11-labelled McN-5652, which selectively labels the 5-HT transporter. We analysed whether there were differences in 5-HT transporter binding between abstinent MDMA users and participants in the control group. Blood and urine samples were taken and tested to check for abstinence. FINDINGS: MDMA users showed decreased global and regional brain 5-HT transporter binding compared with controls.

Several medications are effective for treating depression; however, they take weeks or months to achieve their full effects. A more rapidly acting antidepressant would have a significant impact on the treatment of depression. In a previous study, ketamine produced a rapid antidepressant effect within hours, but the effect lasted less than 1 week. Understanding how ketamine works may lead to a better understanding of the causes of depression and the design of a longer lasting rapidly acting antidepressant. Patients between 18 and 65 years of age who are currently experiencing an episode of major depression of at least 4 weeks duration and have not responded to two treatment trials may be eligible for this study. Candidates are screened with a medical and psychiatric history, physical examination, and blood and urine tests. Participants undergo the following tests and procedures: Medication tapering: Patients who are taking medications for depression are tapered off the drugs over a 1\u2010 to 2\u2010week period. Ketamine/placebo trial: Patients are given a single dose of either ketamine or placebo (an inactive substance), administered intravenously (through a vein) over 40 minutes. After 7 days, patients are given another dose of study drug in crossover fashion; that is, those who previously took ketamine are switched to receive placebo, and those who took placebo are switched to ketamine. Oximetry (measurement of blood oxygen), pulse, and blood pressure are measured continuously for 1 hour before and 4 hours after each ketamine or placebo dose to monitor safety. Interviews and rating scales: Patients complete a series of psychiatric rating scales to assess the effects of the study drug on mood and thinking. The rating scales are repeated up to 18 times during the study, with each time taking about 15 to 20 minutes. Physical examination and laboratory tests: Patients have a physical examination, blood tests, weight measure, and electrocardiogram (ECG) at the beginning and end of the study. They will also have multi\u2010modal MRI, MEG, polysomnography and serum marker studies. The primary endpoint will be the change in clinical ratings of depression.

Psilocybin has evidence for rapid-acting antidepressant effects but has not been investigated in bipolar depression. OBJECTIVE: To establish the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in patients with BDII in a current depressive episode. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This was a 12-week, open-label nonrandomized controlled trial conducted at Sheppard Pratt Hospital. Participants aged 18 to 65 years with BDII, a current depressive episode longer than 3 months, and documented insufficient benefit with at least 2 pharmacologic treatments during the current episode were invited to participate. Of 70 approached, 19 met inclusion criteria and were enrolled. The trial was conducted between April 14, 2021, and January 5, 2023. INTERVENTIONS: A single dose of synthetic psilocybin, 25 mg, was administered. Psychotropic medications were discontinued at least 2 weeks prior to dosing. Therapists met with patients for 3 sessions during pretreatment, during the 8-hour dosing day, and for 3 integration sessions posttreatment. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcome measure was change in Montgomery-\u00c5sberg Depression Rating scale (MADRS) at 3 weeks posttreatment. Secondary measures included MADRS scores 12 weeks posttreatment, the self-rated Quick Inventory of Depression Symptoms-Self Rating (QIDS-SR), and the self-rated Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire-Short Form (Q-LES-Q-SF), each completed at baseline and all subsequent visits. Safety measures included the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS) and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS) completed at each visit. RESULTS: Of the 15 participants in this study (6 male and 9 female; mean [SD] age, 37.8 [11.6] years), all had lower scores at week 3, with a mean (SD) change of -24.00 (9.23) points on the MADRS, (Cohen d\u2009=\u20094.08; 95% CI, -29.11 to -18.89; P\u2009<\u2009.001).

At week 3, 12 participants met the response criterion (50% decrease in MADRS), and 11 met remission criterion (MADRS score \u226410). At the study end point, 12 patients met both response and remission criteria. QIDS-SR scores and Q-LES-Q-SF scores demonstrated similar improvements. YMRS and CSSRS scores did not change significantly at posttreatment compared to baseline.

Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

Despite this risk, the consistency and magnitude of symptoms induced by ketamine or what factors are associated with these symptoms remain unknown. OBJECTIVE: To conduct a meta-analysis of the psychopathological outcomes associated with ketamine in healthy volunteers and patients with schizophrenia and the experimental factors associated with these outcomes. DATA SOURCES: MEDLINE, Embase, and PsychINFO databases were searched for within-participant, placebo-controlled studies reporting symptoms using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) or the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) in response to an acute ketamine challenge in healthy participants or patients with schizophrenia. STUDY SELECTION: Of 8464 citations retrieved, 36 studies involving healthy participants were included. Inclusion criteria were studies (1) including healthy participants; (2) reporting symptoms occurring in response to acute administration of subanesthetic doses of ketamine (racemic ketamine, s-ketamine, r-ketamine) intravenously; (3) containing a placebo condition with a within-subject, crossover design; (4) measuring total positive or negative symptoms using BPRS or PANSS; and (5) providing data allowing the estimation of the mean difference and deviation between the ketamine and placebo condition. DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two independent investigators extracted study-level data for a random-effects meta-analysis. Total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores were extracted. Subgroup analyses were conducted examining the effects of blinding status, ketamine preparation, infusion method, and time between ketamine and placebo conditions. The Meta-analysis of Observational Studies in Epidemiology (MOOSE) and Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were followed. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Standardized mean differences (SMDs) were used as effect sizes for individual studies. Standardized mean differences between ketamine and placebo conditions were calculated for total, positive, and negative BPRS and PANSS scores. RESULTS: The overall sample included 725 healthy volunteers (mean [SD] age, 28.3 [3.6] years; 533 [73.6%] male) exposed to the ketamine and placebo conditions. Racemic ketamine or S-ketamine was associated with a statistically significant increase in transient psychopathology in healthy participants for total (SMD\u2009=\u20091.50 [95% CI,\u20091.23-1.77]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), positive (SMD\u2009=\u20091.55 [95% CI,\u20091.29-1.81]; P\u2009<\u2009.001), and negative (SMD\u2009=\u20091.16 [95% CI,\u20090.96-1.35]; P\u2009<\u2009.001) symptom ratings relative to the placebo condition. The effect size for this association was significantly greater for positive than negative symptoms of psychosis (estimate, 0.36 [95% CI,\u20090.12-0.61]; P\u2009=\u2009.004). There was significant inconsistency in outcomes between studies (I2\u2009range,\u200977%-83%). Bolus followed by constant infusion increased ketamine's association with positive symptoms relative to infusion alone (effect size, 1.63 [95% CI, 1.36-1.90] vs 0.84 [95% CI, 0.35-1.33]; P\u2009=\u2009.006). Single-day study design increased ketamine's ability to generate total symptoms (effect size, 2.29 [95% CI, 1.69-2.89] vs 1.39 [95% CI, 1.12-1.66]; P\u2009=\u2009.007), but age and sex did not moderate outcomes. Insufficient studies were available for meta-analysis of studies in schizophrenia. Of these studies, 2 found a statistically significant increase in symptoms with ketamine administration in total and positive symptoms. Only 1 study found an increase in negative symptom severity with ketamine. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This study found that acute ketamine administration was associated with schizophrenia-like or psychotomimetic symptoms with large effect sizes, but there was a greater increase in positive than negative symptoms and when a bolus was used. These findings suggest that bolus doses should be avoided in the therapeutic use of ketamine to minimize the risk of inducing transient positive (psychotic) symptoms.", "doi": "10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.4693", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32437573/", "secondary_title": "JAMA Netw Open"}

This modified double-blind study investigated the safety, tolerability, and clinical effects of psilocybin, a potent 5-HT(1A) and 5-HT(2A/2C) agonist, in patients with OCD. METHOD: Nine subjects with DSM-IV-defined OCD and no other current major psychiatric disorder participated in up to 4 single-dose exposures to psilocybin in doses ranging from sub-hallucinogenic to frankly hallucinogenic. Low (100 microg/kg), medium (200 microg/kg), and high (300 microg/kg) doses were assigned in that order, and a very low dose (25 microg/kg) was inserted randomly and in double-blind fashion at any time after the first dose. Testing days were separated by at least 1 week. Each session was conducted over an 8-hour period in a controlled environment in an outpatient clinic; subjects were then transferred to a psychiatric inpatient unit for overnight observation. The Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) and a visual analog scale measuring overall obsessive-compulsive symptom severity were administered at 0, 4, 8, and 24 hours post-ingestion. The Hallucinogen Rating Scale was administered at 8 hours, and vital signs were recorded at 0, 1, 4, 8, and 24 hours after ingestion. The study was conducted from November 2001 to November 2004. RESULTS: Nine subjects were administered a total of 29 psilocybin doses. One subject experienced transient hypertension without relation to anxiety or somatic symptoms, but no other significant adverse effects were observed. Marked decreases in OCD symptoms of variable degrees were observed in all subjects during 1 or more of the testing sessions (23%-100% decrease in YBOCS score). Repeated-measures analysis of variance for all YBOCS values revealed a significant main effect of time on Wilks lambda (F = 9.86, df = 3,3; p = .046), but no significant effect of dose (F = 2.25, df = 3,3; p = .261) or interaction of time and dose (F = 0.923, df = 9,45; p = .515). Improvement generally lasted past the 24-hour timepoint.

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2016-36851-001[/rid].) Background: Psychedelics induce intense modifications in the sensorium, the sense of 'self,' and the experience of reality. Despite advances in our understanding of the molecular and cellular level mechanisms of these drugs, knowledge of their actions on global brain dynamics is still incomplete. Recent imaging studies have found changes in functional coupling between frontal and parietal brain structures, suggesting a modification in information flow between brain regions during acute effects. Methods: Here we assessed the psychedelic-induced changes in directionality of information flow during the acute effects of a psychedelic in humans. We measured modifications in connectivity of brain oscillations using transfer entropy, a nonlinear measure of directed functional connectivity based on information theory. Ten healthy male volunteers with prior experience with psychedelics participated in 2 experimental sessions. They received a placebo or a dose of ayahuasca, a psychedelic preparation containing the serotonergic 5-HT2A agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine. Results: The analysis showed significant changes in the coupling of brain oscillations between anterior and posterior recording sites. Transfer entropy analysis showed that frontal sources decreased their influence over central, parietal, and occipital sites. Conversely, sources in posterior locations increased their influence over signals measured at anterior locations. Exploratory correlations found that anterior-to-posterior transfer entropy decreases were correlated with the intensity of subjective effects, while the imbalance between anterior-to-posterior and posterior-to-anterior transfer entropy correlated with the degree of incapacitation experienced. Conclusions: These results suggest that psychedelics induce a temporary disruption of neural hierarchies by reducing top-down control and increasing bottom-up information transfer in the human brain.

Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores \"thinking disorder\" and \"withdrawal/retardation\" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further.", "doi": "10.1007/s002130050620", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9683005/", "secondary_title": "Psychopharmacology (Berl)"}

We developed data-driven subgroups of SI trajectories after ketamine administration, then evaluated clinical, demographic, and neurobiological factors that might predict SI response to ketamine. METHODS: Data were pooled from five clinical ketamine trials. Treatment-resistant inpatients (n\u202f=\u202f128) with DSM-IV-TR-diagnosed major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression received one subanesthetic (0.5\u202fmg/kg) ketamine infusion over 40\u00a0min. Composite SI variable scores were analyzed using growth mixture modeling to generate SI response classes, and class membership predictors were evaluated using multinomial logistic regressions. Putative predictors included demographic variables and various peripheral plasma markers. RESULTS: The best-fitting growth mixture model comprised three classes: Non-Responders (29%), Responders (44%), and Remitters (27%). For Responders and Remitters, maximal improvements were achieved by Day 1. Improvements in SI occurred independently of improvements in a composite Depressed Mood variable for Responders, and partially independently for Remitters. Indicators of chronic SI and self-injury were associated with belonging to the Non-Responder group. Higher levels of baseline plasma interleukin-5 (IL-5) were linked to Remitters rather than Responders. LIMITATIONS: Subjects were not selected for active suicidal thoughts; findings only extend to Day 3; and plasma, rather than CSF, markers were used. CONCLUSION: The results underscore the heterogeneity of SI response to ketamine and its potential independence from changes in Depressed Mood. Individuals reporting symptoms suggesting a longstanding history of chronic SI were less likely to respond or remit post-ketamine.", "doi": "10.1016/j.jad.2018.07.077", "pubmed_url": "https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/30099268/", "secondary_title": "J Affect Disord"}

How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern. Conclusion: Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients. Cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment.

Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20098) or inactive placebo (0\u00a0mg, n\u2009=\u20094) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1\u00a0month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P\u2009=\u20090.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d\u2009=\u20091.4, CI -\u20090.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P\u2009=\u20090.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI -\u20090.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety.
