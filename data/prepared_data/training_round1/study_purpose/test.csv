"1631","Factors associated with Ecstasy use in Turkish students.^\nAIMS: The purpose of this study was to establish the factors associated with Ecstasy use in secondary school students in Turkey. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: This is a survey of a representative sample drawn from cities in different geographical regions in Turkey in 1998 and 2001. The questionnaire was administered to a total of 18,556 and 11,911 10th-grade students in 1998 and 2001, respectively. MEASUREMENTS: The questionnaire administered in the study was adapted from the questionnaires used in 'Monitoring the Future' study in the United States and ESPAD (the European School Survey Project on Alcohol and Other Drugs). It included questions about demographic characteristics, family characteristics, school life, social contacts and use of substances. FINDINGS: While the percentage of those who used Ecstasy at least once in their life-times was 2.65% in 1998, the figure reached 3.31% in 2001. Male gender, older age, use of alcohol, cannabis, heroin and cocaine, non-medical use of psychotherapeutic drugs and participation in a meeting concerning the adverse effects of substance use were found to be significant variables predicting 'ever use' of Ecstasy in both years by logistic regression analysis. CONCLUSIONS: Ecstasy use, while low in Turkey, appears to be on the increase and follows a pattern in terms of correlates that is similar to other illicit drugs. Whatever the causes behind the rise in Ecstasy use, creative, personalized and informative educational programmes should be conducted in all educational institutions to curb Ecstasy use.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"3100","Psychological effects of (S)-ketamine and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT): a double-blind, cross-over study in healthy volunteers.^\nINTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5759","Updating of working memory in ecstasy polydrug users: Findings from fNIRS.^\nAims/Objectives: Cognitive deficits are now well documented in ecstasy (MDMA) users with type and relative demand of task emerging as important factors. The updating component of executive processes appears to be particularly affected. The study reported here used functional near infrared spectroscopy imaging to investigate changes in cortical haemodynamics during memory updating. Method: Twenty ecstasy users and 20 non-users completed verbal and spatial memory updating tasks and brain blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Results: There was no interaction between group and difficulty on the updating tasks, though there was a significant main effect of difficulty on both tasks. The effects of group approached significance on the verbal updating task. There were significant differences in blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change at optodes centred over the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with ecstasy users showing greater blood oxygenation than the other groups. Discussion: The lack of a behavioural difference on both tasks but presence of blood oxygenation and deoxygenation changes in letter updating provides support for the notion that ecstasy-polydrug users are investing more effort to achieve the same behavioural output. Total lifetime dose was high, and recency of use was significantly related to most changes, suggesting that heavy and recent use may be particularly detrimental.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"6449","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone.","[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"6591","Ketamine and midazolam for invasive procedures in children with malignancy: a comparison of routes of intravenous, oral, and rectal administration.^\nWe investigated the efficacy of a combination of ketamine and midazolam, comparing intravenous, oral, and rectal administrations for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. Seventy-three children under 5 years of age, who were scheduled for invasive procedure, were assigned to one of three groups: IV group (n = 25), ketamine 1 mg/kg and midazolam 0.05-0.1 mg/kg were given intravenously; PO group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg were given orally; and PR group (n = 24), ketamine 3 mg/kg and midazolam 0.5 mg/kg given rectally. Vital signs including blood pressure, pulse rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen saturation were monitored, and patients were observed for side-effects. Optimal sedation (drowsy and asleep) was provided in 78 per cent of all patients and no statistical difference was observed among the three groups. No severe complications were observed in all groups. Recovery time from sedation was significantly longer in the intravenous group (>120 min in two patients). Hallucination was noted in three (12 per cent) patients given intravenous medication, but not in those given oral or rectal medications. It is concluded that intravenous, oral, and rectal midazolam/ketamine are equally effective for invasive procedures in children with malignancy. The use of intravenous ketamine/midazolam may produce prolonged sedation and psychedelic effects in children. These adverse effects may alter the child's comfort and parental satisfaction.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"9044","Memory performance and personality traits in current and previous users of ecstasy.^\nBackground: There are only a few studies investigating cognitive performance and personality structures in current und previous users of ecstasy. Still, these studies are necessary to examine the persistent effects of ecstasy use. Method: 30 current and 31 previous users of ecstasy with concomitant use of amphetamine, cannabis, cocaine and LSD and 24 pure cannabis users were compared on a battery of neuropsychological tests and on personality dimensions. Results: There were no significant group differences in all dimensions of the personality questionaire, the tasks of attention and psychomotor speed. Current and previous ecstasy users performed more poorly than cannabis users on tests of immediate and delayed recall. Conclusions: These alterations of cognitive performance could be explained as consequences of possible neurotoxic damage due to ecstasy use or combined drug use. These findings suggest that memory impairments don't seem to be reversed by prolonged abstinence. The assumption that cognitive impairment in ecstasy users is caused exclusively by cannabis use is not supported. © ecomed Medizin, Verlagsgruppe Hüthig Jehle Rehm GmbH.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2118","An open-label pilot trial assessing tolerability and feasibility of LSD microdosing in patients with major depressive disorder (LSDDEP1).^\nBACKGROUND: Globally, an estimated 260 million people suffer from depression [1], and there is a clear need for the development of new, alternative antidepressant therapies. In light of problems with the tolerability and efficacy of available treatments [2], a global trend is emerging for patients to self-treat depression with microdoses of psychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin [3]. Beyond anecdotal reports from those who self-medicate in this way, few clinical trials have evaluated this practice. In our recently published phase 1 study in healthy volunteers [4], we determined that LSD microdosing was relatively safe and well tolerated in that cohort. Furthermore, the data demonstrated that conducting such microdosing trials is broadly feasible, with excellent adherence and compliance to the regimen observed. In this open-label pilot trial of patients with major depressive disorder (LSDDEP1), we will test the tolerability and feasibility of an 8-week regimen of LSD microdosing in this patient group prior to a larger subsequent randomised controlled trial (LSDDEP2). METHODS: Twenty patients meeting the DSM-5 criteria for major depressive disorder will receive an 8-week LSD microdosing treatment regimen. The treatment protocol will use a sublingual formulation of LSD (MB-22001) delivered twice per week under a titration schedule using a dose of 5-15 µg. Tolerability will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of participants who withdraw from the trial due to adverse events attributable to the treatment regimen, while feasibility will be assessed by quantifying the percentage of attended clinic visits once enrolled. To determine whether there is any antidepressant response to the LSD microdosing regimen, MADRS scores will be assessed at baseline and 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after the commencement of the regimen. DISCUSSION: The results of LSDDEP1 will provide valuable information regarding the tolerability and feasibility of a proposed LSD microdosing regimen in patients with MDD. Such information is critically important to optimise trial design prior to commencing a subsequent and more resource-intensive randomised controlled trial.

"8671","Self-reported prevalence of dependence of MDMA compared to cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine among a sample of recreational poly-drug users.^\nBackground: Evidence regarding MDMA (ecstasy) dependence and the most suitable criteria for its assessment are controversial. This study aimed to assess the prevalence of last year symptoms of dependence upon MDMA compared to cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine among a large global non-treatment seeking sample. Methods: A cross-sectional anonymous online survey was promoted by a UK-based dance music website between 15 November 2010 and 1 January 2011. Endorsement of DSM-IV (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders) dependence criteria was sought from all last year users of MDMA, cocaine, mephedrone and ketamine. Reporting ≥3 dependence symptoms was indicative of dependence. Logistic regression models with Generalized Estimating Equations were used to compare dependence symptoms between groups. Results: MDMA users were more likely to report ≥3 DSM-IV dependence symptoms compared to users of cocaine (odds ratio OR 0.81, 95% confidence interval CI 0.71-0.93), mephedrone (OR 0.91, 95%CI 0.78-1.06) and ketamine (OR 0.52, 95%CI 0.44-0.62) (. p<. 0.001). MDMA users were less likely to report desire to use less or get help compared to users of other substances (. p<. 0.001). MDMA got the highest rating of pleasurable high (mean 8.2. ±. 1.7) and lowest rating for risk of harm (mean 2.7. ±. 2.4). Conclusions: Our results highlight the self-reported dependence potential of MDMA but low desire to use less or get help. MDMA's pleasurable effects may compensate for drug-related problems and, therefore, DSM-IV criteria may not be suitable for assessing MDMA dependence. Further research is needed on the ability of DSM-V to assess MDMA dependence.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"7110","Neurobiological Correlates of Psilocybin Response in Depression.^\nObjective: To synthesize the neurobiological basis of brain-resetting effects of psilocybin and identify neuroimaging correlates of psilocybin response in depressed patients. Data Sources: MEDLINE(R), Embase, APA PsycINFO, Cochrane, and CINAHL were systematically searched on June 3, 2022, with no date restrictions using the following string: (psilocybin) AND (psychedelics) AND (MRI) OR (fMRI)) OR (PET)) OR (SPECT)) OR (imaging)) OR (neuroimaging)). Study Selection: After duplicates were removed from 946 studies, 391 studies remained, of which 8 qualified for full-text analysis, but only 5 fulfilled the eligibility criteria of randomized, double-blind, or open-label neuroimaging study with psilocybin treatment in depressed patients. Data Extraction: The Covidence platform was used for deduplication and bias assessment. The a priori data points included concomitant psychological intervention, modality of neuroimaging technique, changes in depression scores, brain functional changes, and association between functional and psilocybin response. Assessment bias was assessed with the standard risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials and the tool for risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions. Results: Four studies were open-label, and one was a combined open-label and randomized controlled trial using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy was administered in 3 studies, 1 in refractory and 2 in nonrefractory patients. The remaining 2 studies were in refractory patients. The transient increase in psilocybin-induced global connectivity in major neural tracts and specific areas of brain activation was associated with antidepressant response. Conclusions: Transient functional brain changes with psilocybin therapy resemble the ""brain reset"" phenomenon and may serve as the putative predictors of psilocybin antidepressant response.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"8870","Oxytocin receptor gene variations and socio-emotional effects of MDMA: A pooled analysis of controlled studies in healthy subjects.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases oxytocin, empathy, and prosociality. Oxytocin plays a critical role in emotion processing and social behavior and has been shown to mediate the prosocial effects of MDMA in animals. Genetic variants, such as single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), of the oxytocin receptor (OXTR) may influence the emotional and social effects of MDMA in humans. The effects of common genetic variants of the OXTR (rs53576, rs1042778, and rs2254298 SNPs) on the emotional, empathogenic, and prosocial effects of MDMA were characterized in up to 132 healthy subjects in a pooled analysis of eight double-blind, placebo-controlled studies. In a subset of 53 subjects, MDMA produced significantly greater feelings of trust in rs1042778 TT genotypes compared with G allele carriers. The rs53576 and rs225498 SNPs did not moderate the subjective effects of MDMA in up to 132 subjects. None of the SNPs moderated MDMA-induced impairments in negative facial emotion recognition or enhancements in emotional empathy in the Multifaceted Empathy Test in 69 subjects. MDMA significantly increased plasma oxytocin concentrations. MDMA and oxytocin concentrations did not differ between OXTR gene variants. The present results provide preliminary evidence that OXTR gene variations may modulate aspects of the prosocial subjective effects of MDMA in humans. However, interpretation should be cautious due to the small sample size. Additionally, OXTR SNPs did not moderate the subjective overall effect of MDMA (any drug effect) or feelings of ""closeness to others"".

"3598","The Efficacy of Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis.^\nBackground: The use of psychedelic compounds to treat psychiatric disorders has become a very significant topic of research over the past several years. Psilocybin has risen to prominence as one of the most studied among these psychedelic compounds. Multiple trials have already shown that it can be a safe and efficacious treatment for various medical conditions. This study intends to perform a meta-analysis of data reported in clinical trials studying psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety. Methods: Articles were searched, screened, and ultimately selected using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was collected from commonly used psychometric tests that measured mood and anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated by comparing scores in these tests at baseline and control to experimental groups. Sub-group analysis was performed to assess psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety during short, medium, and long-term time frames. Results: Statistical significance was achieved in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to controls in multiple subgroups. Heterogeneity of the effect sizes was calculated using an I2 value which showed low to moderate values. Multiple tools were used to assess publication bias, and none could be found. Conclusion: Although research on psilocybin continues to show promise, the evidence is still at a preliminary phase, and more trials need to be conducted with larger patient populations over longer periods for psilocybin to potentially be approved in a community setting.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5276","Naltrexone but Not Ketanserin Antagonizes the Subjective, Cardiovascular, and Neuroendocrine Effects of Salvinorin-A in Humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40mg orally. RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.","[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0]"
"5380","Sub-Acute Effects of Psilocybin on Empathy, Creative Thinking, and Subjective Well-Being.^\nCreative thinking and empathy are crucial for everyday interactions and subjective well-being. This is emphasized by studies showing a reduction in these skills in populations where social interaction and subjective well-being are significantly compromised (e.g., depression). Anecdotal reports and recent studies suggest that a single administration of psilocybin can enhance such processes and could therefore be a potential treatment. However, it has yet to be assessed whether effects outlast acute intoxication. The present study aimed to assess the sub-acute effects of psilocybin on creative thinking, empathy, and well-being. Participants attending a psilocybin retreat completed tests of creative (convergent and divergent) thinking and empathy, and the satisfaction with life scale on three occasions: before ingesting psilocybin (N = 55), the morning after (N = 50), and seven days after (N = 22). Results indicated that psilocybin enhanced divergent thinking and emotional empathy the morning after use. Enhancements in convergent thinking, valence-specific emotional empathy, and well-being persisted seven days after use. Sub-acute changes in empathy correlated with changes in well-being. The study demonstrates that a single administration of psilocybin in a social setting may be associated with sub-acute enhancement of creative thinking, empathy, and subjective well-being. Future research should test whether these effects contribute to the therapeutic effects in clinical populations.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"5705","D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"

"751","Sex differences in ketamine's therapeutic effects for mood disorders: A systematic review.^\nReplicated clinical trials have demonstrated rapid and robust antidepressant effects with ketamine in treatment resistant mood disorders. Sex (biological) and gender differences in therapeutic effects for any new intervention is an important consideration, however, the differential efficacy, safety and tolerability of ketamine in males versus females remains underexplored. The objective of the present systematic review is to identify and qualitatively synthesize all published clinical studies relevant to the sex differential effects of ketamine for mood disorders. A systematic search of PubMed, Medline, and PsycInfo from inception until January 20, 2021, yielded 27 reports including 1715 patients (742 males and 973 females) that met inclusion criteria. Results from the vast majority of studies (88.8%) do not support significant sex differences in antidepressant response, tolerability or safety of ketamine. Nine (33.3%) of the reports included a bioanalytical component in the analysis and only one reported on sex differences. Evidence from the present review does not support clinically or statistically significant sex differences in therapeutic effects with ketamine.

"863","Multiple drug ingestion by ecstasy abusers in the United States.^\nThe abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9). In addition to MDMA/MDA, the most commonly identified drug groups (%) were cannabis (THCCOOH) (61.6%); amphetamine/ methamphetamine (38.4%); benzoylecgonine (30.8%); diazepam-related (9.6%); opiates (7.1%); alprazolam (5.6%); and others (5.6%). Although multidrug ingestion appears to be common amongst ecstasy users, caution is recommended in interpretation. Illicit ecstasy in the United States and Canada frequently contains methamphetamine and other active substances, and multidrug use may not have been intentional.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1278","Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"1418","Acute effects of intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine on suicidal ideation: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nPurpose: Suicide is a major public health concern with currently no validated and efficacious treatments approved. Preliminary evidence suggests that intravenous ketamine has rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, making it a candidate with therapeutic potential for depressed patients at risk for suicide. We conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of ketamine and esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI), as well as their respective onset and duration of action. Data Sources: We searched PubMed, Embase, Ovid, Cochrane, and Web of Science databases for studies published from inception to September 29, 2022. Study Eligibility Criteria: We conducted a systematic review of all parallel randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effect and duration of ketamine or esketamine on SI. Our primary outcome measure was the Suicide Scale score, which was measured using the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), or Modified Scale for Suicidal Ideation (MSSI). To obtain effect sizes (Cohen’s d), we calculated the difference in Suicide Scale scores before and after administration in each group. Results: Our study showed that intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine had a significant anti-SI effect. Specifically, ketamine produced a large degree of anti-SI effect within the 4–6 hours (Cohen’s d = 1.16, 95% CI: 0.50, 1.81) and a medium-large degree in the 24 hours (Cohen’s d = 0.95, 95% CI: 0.48, 1.41). Esketamine, on the other hand, produced a small-medium degree of anti-SI effect within the 4–6 hours timeframe (Cohen’s d = 0.26, 95% CI: 0.09, 0.44) and the 24 hours (Cohen’s d = 0.30, 95% CI: 0.17, 0.47). Conclusion: Intravenous sub-anesthetic doses of ketamine and intranasal inhaled esketamine could reduce SI within 4 hours and last for 24 hours.

DESIGN: Prospective observational study. SETTING: A hospital in Hong Kong. PATIENTS: Female ex-ketamine abusers admitted to a local drug rehabilitation centre and age-matched controls attending a general gynaecology clinic between December 2009 and April 2010. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Evaluation of urinary symptoms based on a 3-day bladder diary, and responses to the Urogenital Distress Inventory Short Form (UDI-6) and the Incontinence Impact Questionnaire Short Form (IIQ-7). The study group had repeat measurements 3 months later. RESULTS: Overall, 90% of ex-ketamine abusers had active urinary symptoms. On average, they had increased 24-hour urinary frequency (10.0 vs 5.8; P=0.001) and lower maximum voided volume (253.3 mL vs 401.9 mL; P<0.001) compared to controls. Correspondingly, the median functional bladder capacity was smaller (195.3 mL vs 261.2 mL; P=0.011) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P<0.001). Among those who abused ketamine for 2 years or more, the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores were higher (P=0.03, P=0.02 respectively). When they stopped abusing ketamine for 3 months or more, their mean 24-hour urinary frequency had decreased (P=0.03), the maximum voided volume had increased (P=0.03) and the mean UDI-6 and IIQ-7 scores had decreased (P=0.04, P=0.02 respectively), although they were still higher than in controls. After 3 more months, in the ex-ketamine abusers there had been a further decrease in 24-hour urinary frequency (P=0.01) and a further improvement in quality of life based on mean UDI-6 scores (P=0.04) but nevertheless poorer than the control group (P<0.01). CONCLUSION: Female ex-ketamine abusers had significant urinary symptoms affecting their quality of life when studied at a mean of 8 (range, 0.5-48) months after cessation of use. The symptom severity was inversely correlated with the duration of cessation; though they improved with time, some still persisted.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1749","Mood and cognitive effects of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'): Week-end 'high' followed by mid-week low.^\nAims. Recreational use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is widespread. The present study aimed to examine both the acute and residual effects of this drug on users' mood and cognitive function. Design and participants. A parallel group design was used to compare 12 participants who reported having taken MDMA with 12 participants who reported having consumed only alcohol, on the relevant night (day 1). These same participants were then re-assessed the following day (day 2) and again mid-week (day 5). Findings. Acute effects of MDMA broadly replicated previous findings. MDMA users rated elevated mood on day 1 but significantly low mood on day 5, at which point some participants scored within the range for clinical depression. In contrast, the alcohol group showed less pronounced changes, which followed a U-shaped curve over days with the lowest point being day 2. The MDMA group also showed significant impairments on an attentional/working memory task, compared with alcohol users. Conclusions. Weekend use of MDMA may lead to depressed mood mid-week. Possible mechanisms underlying the findings are discussed in terms of temporary depletion of serotonin, serotonergic neurotoxity and psychological aspects of mood change.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"1765","Nicotine fails to attenuate ketamine-induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms in humans: implications for schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, induces a range of symptoms resembling those seen in schizophrenia. Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2031","Evidence for chronically altered serotonin function in the cerebral cortex of female 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine polydrug users.^\nCONTEXT: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also popularly known as ""ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that produces loss of serotonin axons in animal models. Whether MDMA produces chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in humans remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MDMA use is associated with chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in the cerebral cortex of women as reflected by increased serotonin(2A) receptor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study comparing serotonin(2A) receptor levels in abstinent female MDMA polydrug users with those in women who did not use MDMA (within-group design assessing the association of lifetime MDMA use and serotonin(2A) receptors). Case participants were abstinent from MDMA use for at least 90 days as verified by analysis of hair samples. The serotonin(2A) receptor levels in the cerebral cortex were determined using serotonin(2A)-specific positron emission tomography with radioligand fluorine 18-labeled setoperone as the tracer. SETTING: Academic medical center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 female MDMA users and 10 women who did not use MDMA (controls). The main exclusion criteria were nondrug-related DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders and general medical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical serotonin(2A) receptor nondisplaceable binding potential (serotonin(2A)BP(ND)). RESULTS: MDMA users had increased serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in occipital-parietal (19.7%), temporal (20.5%), occipitotemporal-parietal (18.3%), frontal (16.6%), and frontoparietal (18.5%) regions (corrected P < .05). Lifetime MDMA use was positively associated with serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in frontoparietal (β = 0.665; P = .007), occipitotemporal (β = 0.798; P = .002), frontolimbic (β = 0.634; P = .02), and frontal (β = 0.691; P = .008) regions. In contrast, there were no regions in which MDMA use was inversely associated with receptor levels. There were no statistically significant effects of the duration of MDMA abstinence on serotonin(2A)BP(ND). CONCLUSIONS: The recreational use of MDMA is associated with long-lasting increases in serotonin(2A) receptor density. Serotonin(2A) receptor levels correlate positively with lifetime MDMA use and do not decrease with abstinence. These results suggest that MDMA use produces chronic serotonin neurotoxicity in humans. Given the broad role of serotonin in human brain function, the possibility for therapeutic MDMA use, and the widespread recreational popularity of this drug, these results have critical public health implications.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2034","The effectiveness, safety and tolerability of ketamine for depression in adolescents and older adults: A systematic review.^\nThe majority of antidepressant medication trials have focused on adult populations (ages 18-65), with much less research in older and younger populations. Moreover, key differences in the efficacy and safety of antidepressants have been identified between these age groups. Ketamine has emerged as a promising new treatment for treatment resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this review is to summarize and synthesize the extant literature on the effectiveness, safety and tolerability of ketamine for depression in special age populations (age ≤18 and ≥ 60). Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic review was performed, searching EMBASE, PsycInfo, and PubMed from inception through July 2020. Studies reporting the use of any ketamine formulation with variable routes of administration to treat clinically diagnosed depression in adolescents or older adults were included. Thirteen studies were included in the analysis and ten observed rapid (≤2 week latency) antidepressant effects following ketamine treatments, with better outcomes following larger, repeated doses, and in open-label rather than blinded settings. Two case reports in adolescents assessed measures of suicidal ideation and both found ketamine to effectuate rapid anti-suicidal effects. Ketamine appears to be safe and well-tolerated in adolescents and older adults. The small quantity, high heterogeneity, and generally low quality of available studies precludes statistical syntheses and significantly limits the strength of our conclusions. Preliminary proof-of-concept studies are promising, however, rigorously designed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are still required to ascertain effectiveness, safety and tolerability in these groups.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"2245","Psilocybin induces aberrant prediction error processing for tactile mismatch responses.^\nBackground: The skin as the body's largest organ is our first contact point with the environment encoding information of many different sources as well as providing a sense of boundaries and the Self/Non‐Self discrimination – thus forming a backdrop of all perceptual experiences [1]. Predictive codes integrating bodily states and sensory inputs may give rise to self‐awareness and a sense of agency. Distortions in these processes have been linked to psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenic delusions [2]. However, the relationship between altered tactile prediction error (PE) processing and distorted self‐experience and its underlying neuropharmacology have never been empirically studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the preferential 5‐HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self‐experience, on the processing of tactile mismatch responses by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: In this cross‐over, double‐blind, within‐subject, randomized and placebo‐controlled study, fifteen healthy participants (8 males, and 7 females, aged between 20–40 years) received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight p. o. oral administration of the 5‐HT2A/1A agonist Psi. Participants completed a roving oddball task while undergoing fMRI 85 minutes after Psi/Pla administration during peak of subjective Psi effects. To induce tactile mismatch responses, trains of stimuli switched randomly between high (double pulse) and low (single pulse) intensity after a variable number of 3 to 7 repetitions, generating an unpredictable sequence. The first stimulus of each train was modelled as the “Deviant (D)"" and the third repetition of each train as “Standard"" (S). All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using a MR‐safe electrode and a constant current stimulator (Digitimer, DS7AH). The fMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in the SPM12 software package. The dependent variables were the fMRI BOLD contrasts D > S. Subjective effects were measured using the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). 5D‐ASC scores were analyzed by using a repeated‐measures ANOVA design with treatment condition (Pla and Psi) and scale as within‐subject factors. Results: In response to unpredicted stimuli significant decreases in brain activity after Psi administration were detected for the D > S contrast in areas previously implicated in body awareness and tactile deviancy processing: thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, midcingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Further, Psi produced robust perceptual alterations of bodily awareness and self‐experience assessed with the rating scale 5D‐ASC. Conclusion: This study shows that Psi alters the integration of tactile stimuli through aberrant PE signalling, potentially the underlying mechanism of Psi‐induced alterations of self and body‐experience. Furthermore, it points to the important role of the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes in the processes of self‐experience. This finding may be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders compromised by distorted self‐experience.","[0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"2957","Glutamatergic Signaling Drives Ketamine-Mediated Response in Depression: Evidence from Dynamic Causal Modeling.^\nBACKGROUND: The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. Thus, modulating glutamatergic transmission may be critical to effectively treating depression, though the mechanisms by which this occurs are not fully understood. METHODS: This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 18 drug-free major depressive disorder subjects and 18 heathy controls who received a single i.v. infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an i.v. saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6 to 9 hours after both ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants passively received tactile stimulation to the right index finger. Antidepressant response was assessed across timepoints using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Dynamic causal modeling was used to measure changes in α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole propionic acid (AMPA)- and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)-mediated connectivity estimates in major depressive disorder subjects and controls using a simple model of somatosensory evoked responses. RESULTS: Both major depressive disorder and healthy subjects showed ketamine-mediated NMDA-blockade sensitization, with major depressive disorder subjects showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in backward connections and controls showing enhanced NMDA connectivity estimates in forward connections in our model. Within our major depressive disorder subject group, ketamine efficacy, as measured by improved mood ratings, correlated with reduced NMDA and AMPA connectivity estimates in discrete extrinsic connections within the somatosensory cortical network. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that AMPA- and NMDA-mediated glutamatergic signaling play a key role in antidepressant response to ketamine and, further, that dynamic causal modeling is a powerful tool for modeling AMPA- and NMDA-mediated connectivity in vivo.

"4506","LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nRationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.","[0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]"
"5641","A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

"5644","Assessment of Relationship of Ketamine Dose With Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy of Glx and GABA Responses in Adults With Major Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE: A single subanesthetic dose of ketamine produces an antidepressant response in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) within hours, but the mechanism of antidepressant effect is uncertain. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ketamine dose and brain glutamate and glutamine (Glx) and γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) level responses to ketamine are related to antidepressant benefit and adverse effects. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This randomized, parallel-group, triple-masked clinical trial included 38 physically healthy, psychotropic medication-free adult outpatients who were in a major depressive episode of MDD but not actively suicidal. The trial was conducted at Columbia University Medical Center. Data were collected from February 2012 to May 2015. Data analysis was conducted from January to March 2020. INTERVENTION: Participants received 1 dose of placebo or ketamine (0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, or 0.5 mg/kg) intravenously during 40 minutes of a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy scan that measured ventro-medial prefrontal cortex Glx and GABA levels in 13-minute data frames. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Clinical improvement was measured using a 22-item version of the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-22) 24 hours after ketamine was administered. Ketamine and metabolite blood levels were measured after the scan. RESULTS: A total of 38 individuals participated in the study, with a mean (SD) age of 38.6 (11.2) years, 23 (60.5%) women, and 25 (65.8%) White patients. Improvement in HDRS-22 score at 24 hours correlated positively with ketamine dose (t36 = 2.81; P = .008; slope estimate, 19.80 [95% CI, 5.49 to 34.11]) and blood level (t36 = 2.25; P = .03; slope estimate, 0.070 [95% CI, 0.007 to 0.133]). The lower the Glx response, the better the antidepressant response (t33 = -2.400; P = .02; slope estimate, -9.85 [95% CI, -18.2 to -1.50]). Although GABA levels correlated with Glx (t33 = 8.117; P < .001; slope estimate, 0.510 [95% CI, 0.382 to 0.638]), GABA response did not correlate with antidepressant effect. When both ketamine dose and Glx response were included in a mediation analysis model, ketamine dose was no longer associated with antidepressant effect, indicating that Glx response mediated the relationship. Adverse effects were related to blood levels in men only (t5 = 2.606; P = .048; estimated slope, 0.093 [95% CI, 0.001 to 0.186]), but Glx and GABA response were not related to adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this study, intravenous ketamine dose and blood levels correlated positively with antidepressant response. The Glx response correlated inversely with ketamine dose and with antidepressant effect. Future studies are needed to determine whether the relationship between Glx level and antidepressant effect is due to glutamate or glutamine.

"6108","Ketamine Versus Electroconvulsive Therapy in Depression.^\nWorldwide, depression carries a significant burden. Although there are effective treatments for depression, many patients do not achieve remission, and any significant response usually occurs after a few weeks. The common approach for a rapid intervention in cases of severe depressive symptoms has been electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). There are drawbacks to ECT including a prior medical work‐up, general anaesthesia, and the possibility of memory loss. Further, access to ECT is often limited. Comparatively, the most striking breakthrough in the field of mood disorders has been the rapid antidepressant effects of intravenous ketamine. The antidepressant response to ketamine often occurs within a few hours, and peaks within 24. Recent studies have documented that the benefits of ketamine can be sustained with repeated administration. This longitudinal, multi‐centre, randomized, crossover clinical trial is funded in part by the Ontario Brain Institute through a sponsorship with the Canadian Biomarker Integration Network in Depression (CAN‐BIND) research program. It will take place across five sites: the Royal Ottawa Mental Health Centre (lead site), Douglas Mental Health University Institute, Providence Care Hospital, Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and University Health Network. A total of 240 participants (accounting for 20% dropout) will be recruited over 30 months from ECT wait lists across the five sites and randomized to either the ketamine or ECT treatment arm. Participants in the ketamine treatment arm will receive 0.5 mg/kg IV over 40 minutes in the recovery room of the ECT clinic as per the study schedule. Participants in the ECT treatment arm will receive ECT as per the study schedule and as decided by their treating physician. Each participant will be enrolled in the study for between six weeks and nine months, or until they leave the study or the study is terminated. Throughout the study, clinical, neuroimaging, molecular, and cognitive assessments will be conducted. Data will be collected using the Ontario Brain Institute's Centre for Ontario Data Exploration and Research Electronic Data Capture in order to coordinate data from the five sites. The aim of this study is to show that compared to ECT, ketamine treatment produces faster therapeutic action, has less side effects, requires fewer/shorter hospitalizations for patients, and will be less expensive because it does not require an anaesthesiologist and a psychiatrist to administer the various ECT protocols. Through the discovery of biomarkers to predict ECT or ketamine response or non‐response, the anticipated effective treatment could be administered as a first line intervention for a subgroup of depressed patients, thereby ensuring a more time‐efficient intervention. Participants randomized to the either treatment arm will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the randomization phase, responders may move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders may move to the crossover phase where they will receive the alternate therapy. During the crossover phase, participants will receive thrice weekly treatments for 3 or 4 weeks for a total of 9 or 12 treatments respectively. Following the crossover phase, responders will move to the maintenance phase and non‐responders will exit the study. During the maintenance phase, participants who achieved response with ketamine will receive weekly ketamine treatments for one month, treatment once every two weeks for two months, and monthly treatment for three months. Should participants in the ketamine arm relapse during monthly treatment, they may return to treatments once every two weeks. Participants who achieved response in the ECT arm will receive ECT treatment for six months based on decision of the treating physician in order to maintain a clinical response. Both treatment arms will have a follow‐up visit during month seven.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"6232","Effects of Repeated Psilocybin Dosing in OCD.^\nAim 1: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms among participants in the immediate treatment condition, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment condition. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the immediate treatment group will report statistically significantly greater symptom improvement from baseline 4 days post‐second dose, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment group at the same interval during their waitlist phase. Aim 2: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, compared to one dose. The investigators hypothesize that two doses of oral psilocybin will reduce OCD symptoms to a statistically significantly greater extent than one dose. This study aims to investigate the effects of repeated dosing of oral psilocybin on OCD symptomatology and assess psychological mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's therapeutic effects on OCD. This study will employ a randomized, waitlist‐controlled design with blinded independent ratings, with participants randomized to receive either immediate treatment (two doses oral psilocybin separated by one week) or delayed treatment (7 weeks post‐randomization). An adaptive dose selection strategy will be implemented, with the first dose being standardized at 25 mg of psilocybin, and the second dose being either the same or a higher dosage (i.e., 30 mg) on the basis of a clinically significant response from baseline or not, respectively, 4 days post‐first dose. This study is conducted entirely on an outpatient basis with the possibility of remote/virtual follow‐up visits after each dosing session.

Animal experiments indicate that MDMA is a potent neurotoxin specifically affecting the serotonergic system. A few functional neuroimaging studies revealed central nervous alterations after the repeated use of ecstasy. We examined 94 ecstasy users in comparison to 27 control subjects by means of positron emission tomography (PET) with 2-[18F]-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG). The FDG uptake rates were globally reduced in ecstasy users, most pronounced in the striatum. The uptake rates tended to be negatively correlated with the cumulative ecstasy doses.

"6558","The effects of a sub-anaesthetic dose of ketamine on human selective attention.^\nTested the hypothesis that a sub-anaesthetic dose of the noncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist, ketamine, would induce psychophysiological and selective attention anomalies in healthy Ss that are commonly observed in schizophrenic patients. In a double-blind randomized placebo-controlled design, 18 healthy male 20–28 yr olds were challenged with 0.3 mg/kg ketamine. Ss were then tested in a selective attention task in which standard (80%) and deviant tones (20%) of either 1000 or 1100 Hz were evenly presented to the left or right ear. Stimulus duration was 50 ms and the interstimulus intervals were randomized between 1750 and 2150 ms. The S was instructed to push a button as quickly as possible after hearing the deviant tone in a specified ear. Ketamine did not alter selective attention task performance of the Ss, but did reduce processing negativity and the P300 amplitude (both in general and to deviant stimuli in particular), enhanced the N100 amplitude to deviant stimuli, and did not effect mismatch negativity. Ketamine induces some of the attentional deficits in healthy Ss that are observed in schizophrenics, suggesting that reduced glutamatergic activity in the brain may be involved in some of the symptoms of schizophrenia.

"6677","Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^\nMephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"6740","The effects of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine on verbal memory in normal volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: N-methyl-D: -aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonists have been reported to induce schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans, including memory impairments. Although the NMDA receptor has been shown to impair memory acquisition by disrupting long-term potentiation (LTP), limited research has been done on studying the effects of NMDA antagonists on the post-LTP cascade of events implicated in consolidation as measured by administering the drug after the initial learning experience. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this experiment was to examine the effect of ketamine on mental status and to identify NMDA antagonist-induced memory deficits by comparing the recall performance of items presented both immediately before and during ketamine infusion. METHODS: Thirteen normal controls received a 60-min infusion of ketamine in a randomized double-blind, cross-over design. Mental status was evaluated with the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale. The first 12-item word list was presented immediately before infusion, and two lists were subsequently presented during the infusion. Verbal memory performance was assessed by measuring the delayed cued recall of each list 30 min after its presentation. RESULTS: At the beginning, subjects experienced perceptual and reality distortion symptoms, followed later by mild subjective effects. Ketamine significantly reduced the delayed recall of words presented immediately before, but not during, drug infusion. Ketamine-induced decrements in verbal recall correlated significantly with plasma ketamine levels. CONCLUSION: This study characterizes the behavioral effects associated with ketamine and suggests that ketamine decreases verbal memory performance by interfering with early consolidation processes.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"7943","A randomized, double-blind, active placebo-controlled study of efficacy, safety, and durability of repeated vs single subanesthetic ketamine for treatment-resistant depression.^\nThe strategy of repeated ketamine in open-label and saline-control studies of treatment-resistant depression suggested greater antidepressant response beyond a single ketamine. However, consensus guideline stated the lack of evidence to support frequent ketamine administration. We compared the efficacy and safety of single vs. six repeated ketamine using midazolam as active placebo. Subjects received either six ketamine or five midazolam followed by a single ketamine during 12 days followed by up to 6-month post-treatment period. The primary end point was the change from baseline in the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h after the last infusion. Fifty-four subjects completed all six infusions. For the primary outcome measure, there was no significant difference in change of MADRS scores between six ketamine group and single ketamine group at 24 h post-last infusion. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy compared to midazolam after five infusions before receiving single ketamine infusion. Remission and response favored the six ketamine after infusion 4 and 5, respectively, compared to midazolam before receiving single ketamine infusion. For those who responded, the median time-to-relapse was nominally but not statistically different (2 and 6 weeks for the single and six ketamine group, respectively). Repeated infusions were relatively well-tolerated. Repeated ketamine showed greater antidepressant efficacy to midazolam after five infusions but fell short of significance when compared to add-on single ketamine to midazolam at the end of 2 weeks. Increasing knowledge on the mechanism of ketamine should drive future studies on the optimal balance of dosing ketamine for maximum antidepressant efficacy with minimum exposure.","[1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8041","Comparative Effectiveness of Intravenous Ketamine and Intranasal Esketamine in Clinical Practice Among Patients With Treatment-Refractory Depression: An Observational Study.^\nObjective: Ketamine has been redeveloped as a rapid-acting antidepressant for treatment-resistant depression (TRD). There is a paucity of literature comparing subanesthetic intravenous (IV) ketamine and US Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved intranasal (IN) esketamine for TRD in real-world clinical settings. We compared the efficacy and time to achieve remission/response with repeated ketamine and esketamine. Methods: An observational study of adults with TRD received up to 6 IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) or up to 8 IN esketamine (56- or 84-mg) treatments from August 17, 2017, to June 24, 2021. Depressive symptoms were measured utilizing the 16-item Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology self-report (QIDS-SR) before and 24 hours after treatment. Cox proportional hazard models were used to evaluate associations between time to response ( ≥ 50% change in QIDS-SR score) and remission (QIDS-SR score ≤ 5). Results: Sixty-two adults (median age = 50 years, 65% female) received IV ketamine (76%, n = 47) or IN esketamine (24%, n = 15). Neither baseline-to-endpoint change in QIDS-SR score nor response/remission rates were significantly different between groups. Time to remission, defined as number of treatments (adjusting for age, body mass index [BMI], sex, and baseline QIDS-SR score), was faster for IV versus IN treatment (HR = 5.0, P = .02). Conclusions: Intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine showed similar rates of response and remission in TRD patients, but the number of treatments required to achieve remission was significantly lower with IV ketamine compared to IN esketamine. These findings need to be investigated in a randomized control trial comparing these two treatment interventions.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"8810","Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.","[0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
