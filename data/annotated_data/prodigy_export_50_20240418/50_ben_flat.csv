305,"Administration of Sub-anesthetic Dose of Ketamine and Electroconvulsive Treatment on Alternate Week Days in Patients with Treatment Resistant Depression: A Double Blind Placebo Controlled Trial.^
INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND: Patients with depression who fail to respond to at least two antidepressants in their current episode are considered to have Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). ECT is an effective treatment of TRD but cognitive side effects limit its use. Ketamine elicits a rapid antidepressant response in sub-anesthetic repeated doses. ECT and ketamine may be modulating the glutamate system, therefore when administered in an interleaved fashion, they could have a synergistic effect. METHODS: 15 TRD patients were recruited and 12 were included in the analysis. Patients were randomly assigned to an ECT + iv. ketamine or ECT + iv. placebo (midazolam). At baseline and before each infusion, depression severity scales were administered. At baseline, halfway through and at the end of the study, cognitive tests were administered. RESULTS: There was no difference between the ketamine and placebo arms, per change in 17-item Hamilton Depression Scores (HAM-D), Young Mania Rating Scores or cognitive tests. Per HAMD scores, 3 ECT +ketamine subjects (42%) showed early remission (HAMD < 8) and maintained euthymia for 3 additional visits. None of the ECT +midazolam subjects (0%) achieved early remission. This difference showed a trend level significance (Chi square P-Value = 0.0910). CONCLUSION: The results of the study were limited due to the small sample size. However, a trend level difference in rates of early remission was seen, suggesting that ketamine + ECT may lead to a faster symptom relief. A larger sample size is needed for statistical confirmation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0
777,"Antidepressant effects of ketamine in depressed patients.^
BACKGROUND: A growing body of preclinical research suggests that brain glutamate systems may be involved in the pathophysiology of major depression and the mechanism of action of antidepressants. This is the first placebo-controlled, double-blinded trial to assess the treatment effects of a single dose of an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist in patients with depression. METHODS: Seven subjects with major depression completed 2 test days that involved intravenous treatment with ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or saline solutions under randomized, double-blind conditions. RESULTS: Subjects with depression evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 72 hours after ketamine but not placebo infusion (i.e., mean 25-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale scores decreased by 14 +/- SD 10 points vs. 0 +/- 12 points, respectively during active and sham treatment).

1240,"Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Esketamine for the Rapid Reduction of Symptoms of Depression and Suicidality in Patients at Imminent Risk for Suicide: Results of a Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study.^
OBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy of standard-of-care treatment plus intranasal esketamine or placebo for rapid reduction of symptoms of major depression, including suicidality, among individuals at imminent suicide risk. METHOD: In a double-blind, multicenter, proof-of-concept study, 68 participants were randomly assigned to receive esketamine (84 mg) or placebo twice weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to comprehensive standard-of-care treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in score from baseline to 4 hours after initial dose on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Clinician global judgment of suicide risk (from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool) was also assessed. Secondary endpoints included these measures at 24 hours and double-blind endpoint at day 25. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in MADRS score was observed in the esketamine group compared with the placebo group at 4 hours (least-square mean difference=-5.3, SE=2.10; effect size=0.61) and at ∼24 hours (least-square mean difference=-7.2, SE=2.85; effect size=0.65), but not at day 25 (least-square mean difference=-4.5, SE=3.14; effect size=0.35). Significantly greater improvement was also observed in the esketamine group on the MADRS suicidal thoughts item score at 4 hours (effect size=0.67), but not at 24 hours (effect size=0.35) or at day 25 (effect size=0.29). Between-group reductions in clinician global judgment of suicide risk scores were not statistically different at any time point. The most common adverse events among participants in the esketamine group were nausea, dizziness, dissociation, unpleasant taste, and headache. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that intranasal esketamine compared with placebo, given in addition to comprehensive standard-of-care treatment, may result in significantly rapid improvement in depressive symptoms, including some measures of suicidal ideation, among depressed patients at imminent risk for suicide.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1385,"A cluster randomised controlled trial of the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module in Australian secondary schools: study protocol.^
BACKGROUND: The use of ecstasy is a public health problem and is associated with a range of social costs and harms. In recent years, there has been growing concern about the availability and misuse of new and emerging drugs designed to mimic the effects of illicit drugs, including ecstasy. This, coupled with the fact that the age of use and the risk factors for using ecstasy and emerging drugs are similar, provides a compelling argument to implement prevention for these substances simultaneously. The proposed study will evaluate whether a universal Internet-based prevention program, known as the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module, can address and prevent the use of ecstasy and emerging drugs among adolescents. METHODS: A cluster randomised controlled trial will be conducted among Year 10 students (aged 15-16 years) from 12 secondary schools in Sydney, Australia. Schools will be randomly assigned to either the Climate Schools intervention group or the control group. All students will complete a self-report questionnaire at baseline, immediately post-intervention, and 6-, 12- and 24-months post-baseline. The primary outcome measures will include ecstasy and emerging drug-related knowledge, intentions to use these substances in the future, and the patterns of use of ecstasy and emerging drugs. A range of secondary outcomes will also be assessed, including beliefs and attitudes about ecstasy and emerging drugs, peer pressure resistance, other substance use and mental health outcomes. DISCUSSION: To our knowledge, this will be the first evaluation of an Internet-based program designed to specifically target ecstasy and NED use among adolescents. If deemed effective, the Climate Schools: Ecstasy and Emerging Drugs Module will provide schools with an interactive and novel prevention program for ecstasy and emerging drugs that can be readily implemented by teachers.

1441,"Effects of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism on antidepressant response to low-dose ketamine infusion.^
Evidence suggests that levels of treatment refractoriness and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) rs6265 polymorphism are related to the antidepressant effects of conventional antidepressants and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation. However, whether these factors are associated with the antidepressant effects of low-dose ketamine remains unclear. In total, 71 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) were randomized to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, 0.2 mg/kg ketamine, and saline control infusion groups. They were further divided into three treatment refractoriness groups according to the Maudsley staging method and were genotyped for Val66Met BDNF polymorphism. Participants' Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) scores were assessed preinfusion, at 40, 80, 120, and 240 min postinfusion, and sequentially on days 2-7 and 14 after infusion. Patients with any Val allele exhibited an antidepressant response (p = 0.029) to 0.5 mg/kg ketamine vs. 0.2 mg/kg ketamine vs. saline control infusions. However, the trajectory of HDRS scores did not differ (p = 0.236) between the treatment groups among Met/Met carriers. In the low treatment refractoriness group, the 0.2 mg/kg ketamine infusion exhibited the optimal antidepressant effect (p = 0.002); in the moderate treatment refractoriness group, the 0.5 mg/kg ketamine infusion achieved the strongest antidepressant effect (p = 0.006); however, in the high treatment refractoriness group, the trajectory of depressive symptoms did not differ between treatments (p = 0.325). In future clinical practice, ketamine dose may be adjusted according to the level of treatment refractoriness and BDNF rs6265 polymorphism to achieve the optimal antidepressant effect for patients with TRD.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
1692,"Predicting changes in substance use following psychedelic experiences: natural language processing of psychedelic session narratives.^
Background: Experiences with psychedelic drugs, such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), are sometimes followed by changes in patterns of tobacco, opioid, and alcohol consumption. But, the specific characteristics of psychedelic experiences that lead to changes in drug consumption are unknown. Objective: Determine whether quantitative descriptions of psychedelic experiences derived using Natural Language Processing (NLP) would allow us to predict who would quit or reduce using drugs following a psychedelic experience. Methods: We recruited 1141 individuals (247 female, 894 male) from online social media platforms who reported quitting or reducing using alcohol, cannabis, opioids, or stimulants following a psychedelic experience to provide a verbal narrative of the psychedelic experience they attributed as leading to their reduction in drug use. We used NLP to derive topic models that quantitatively described each participant’s psychedelic experience narrative. We then used the vector descriptions of each participant’s psychedelic experience narrative as input into three different supervised machine learning algorithms to predict long-term drug reduction outcomes. Results: We found that the topic models derived through NLP led to quantitative descriptions of participant narratives that differed across participants when grouped by the drug class quit as well as the long-term quit/reduction outcomes. Additionally, all three machine learning algorithms led to similar prediction accuracy (~65%, CI = ±0.21%) for long-term quit/reduction outcomes.

2232,"Baseline delta sleep ratio predicts acute ketamine mood response in major depressive disorder.^
BACKGROUND: Electroencephalographic (EEG) sleep slow wave activity (SWA; EEG power between 0.6 and 4Hz) has been proposed as a marker of central synaptic plasticity. Decreased generation of sleep slow waves--a core feature of sleep in depression--indicates underlying plasticity changes in the disease. Various measures of SWA have previously been used to predict antidepressant treatment response. This study examined the relationship between baseline patterns of SWA in the first two NREM episodes and antidepressant response to an acute infusion of the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Thirty patients (20M, 10F, 18-65) fulfilling DSM-IV criteria for treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) who had been drug-free for two weeks received a single open-label infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (.5mg/kg) over 40 min. Depressive symptoms were assessed with the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after ketamine infusion. Sleep recordings were obtained the night before the infusion and were visually scored. SWA was computed for individual artifact-free NREM sleep epochs, and averaged for each NREM episode. Delta sleep ratio (DSR) was calculated as SWA(NREM1)/SWA(NREM2). RESULTS: A significant positive correlation was observed between baseline DSR and reduced MADRS scores from baseline to Day 1 (r=.414, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was relatively small (N=30) and all subjects had treatment-resistant MDD, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Further studies are needed to replicate and extend this observation to other patient groups.

2465,"The influence of 5-HTT and COMT genotypes on verbal fluency in ecstasy users.^
Deficits in verbal fluency associated with ecstasy use have been well established; however, the mechanisms underlying this impairment have yet to be elucidated. In this study we investigated for the first time whether there was a disproportionate impairment in two cognitive subcomponents of verbal fluency: clustering (ability to generate words within the same subcategory) and switching (ability to change the subcategory). We also investigated a possible association between ecstasy use and verbal fluency in subjects genotyped for 5-HTT (5-HTTLPR and 5-HTTVNTR) and COMT (val108/158met, rs165599 and rs2097603) polymorphisms, in order to find a potential implication of genetic factors. Ecstasy polydrug users (n = 30) and non-ecstasy users (n = 41) were evaluated in both semantic and phonemic fluency. Results showed that ecstasy users had poorer semantic (but not phonemic) fluency performance than controls. Detailed analysis of clustering and switching performance revealed that this impairment was associated with poorer clustering mechanisms. Clustering was also modulated by the COMT rs165599 polymorphism independently of the group. A specific effect of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism on switching performance was also found, with ss carriers performing significantly worse than ls and ll carriers, suggesting a serotonin modulation of frontal-executive flexibility. Based on the impaired clustering and switching strategies observed in ecstasy users, it might be proposed that both semantic knowledge and retrieval are impaired in this population. The verbal fluency deficit in ecstasy users may be attributable to a disruption of frontal-striatal circuits directly related with the serotonin function as well as a depletion of lexical-semantic stores mediated by temporal structures. © The Author(s) 2010.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0

Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD.

2783,"MDMA Increases Cooperation and Recruitment of Social Brain Areas When Playing Trustworthy Players in an Iterated Prisoner's Dilemma.^
Social decision-making is fundamental for successful functioning and can be affected in psychiatric illness and by serotoninergic modulation. The Prisoner's Dilemma is the archetypal paradigm to model cooperation and trust. However, the effect of serotonergic enhancement is poorly characterized, and its influence on the effect of variations in opponent behavior unknown. To address this, we conducted a study investigating how the serotonergic enhancer 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) modulates behavior and its neural correlates during an iterated Prisoner's Dilemma with both trustworthy and untrustworthy opponents. We administered 100 mg MDMA or placebo to 20 male participants in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study. While being scanned, participants played repeated rounds with opponents who differed in levels of cooperation. On each round, participants chose to compete or cooperate and were asked to rate their trust in the other player. Cooperation with trustworthy, but not untrustworthy, opponents was enhanced following MDMA but not placebo (respectively: odds ratio = 2.01; 95% CI, 1.42-2.84, p < 0.001; odds ratio = 1.37; 95% CI, 0.78-2.30, not significant). Specifically, MDMA enhanced recovery from, but not the impact of, breaches in cooperation. During trial outcome, MDMA increased activation of four clusters incorporating precentral and supramarginal gyri, superior temporal cortex, central operculum/posterior insula, and supplementary motor area. There was a treatment × opponent interaction in right anterior insula and dorsal caudate. Trust ratings did not change across treatment sessions. MDMA increased cooperative behavior when playing trustworthy opponents. Underlying this was a change in brain activity of regions linked to social cognition. Our findings highlight the context-specific nature of MDMA's effect on social decision-making.SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT We provide a detailed analysis of the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA) on cooperative behavior during interpersonal interactions, as well as the neural correlates underlying these effects. We find that, following administration of MDMA, participants behave more cooperatively, but only when interacting with trustworthy partners. While breaches of trustworthy behavior have a similar impact following administration of MDMA compared with placebo, MDMA facilitates a greater recovery from these breaches of trust. Underlying this altered behavior are changes in brain activity during the viewing of opponents' behavior in regions whose involvement in social processing is well established. This work provides new insights into the impact of MDMA on social interactions, emphasizing the important role of the behavior of others toward us.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
2832,"Is ecstasy perceived to be safe? A critical survey.^
Recent publications claim that the recreational drug ecstasy is considered to be safe by many or most ecstasy users, or by young people or the general public. Unfortunately, there are no references that provide any support for this claim. Previous studies of various populations, including drug users and adolescents in several nations, also failed to support claims of the perceived safety of ecstasy. Epidemiological surveys from the USA and UK consistently report high proportions of young people who perceive great risk in using ecstasy. Studies in ecstasy users show that they are aware of a number of short- and long-term risks of ecstasy use, although, in the absence of actual problems, they evaluate the personal significance of these risks as low. This study further investigated the perceived harmfulness of ecstasy, drawing on an online survey of over 900 drug users. Little support for the claim was found. Seventy-three percent of the participants in the online survey viewed ecstasy as carrying at least 'some risk'. The claim of ecstasy's perceived safety is plausibly based on researchers' assumptions that the continued widespread use of the drug indicates that users are unaware of the associated risks, and that informing them about these risks would lead to a reduction in drug use. We argue that these assumptions are inadequate and that drug information and harm reduction strategies should focus on more affective and personally significant aspects of risk perception. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

3104,"Neurometabolic effects of psilocybin, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE) and d-methamphetamine in healthy volunteers. A double-blind, placebo-controlled PET study with [18F]FDG.^
The neurometabolic effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin (PSI; 0.2 mg/kg), the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE; 2 mg/kg) and the stimulant d-methamphetamine (METH; 0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and the drugs' interactions with a prefrontal activation task were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucoseFDG-positron emission tomographicPET study (each group: n = 8). Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand. The MDE data support the hypothesis that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class, which takes an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3371,"The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^
Examined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine.

3537,"Gray matter volume of rostral anterior cingulate cortex predicts rapid antidepressant response to ketamine.^
Ketamine was recently approved for treatment resistant depression. However, despite its therapeutic potential, about 50% of patients do not show improvement under this therapy. In this prospective two-site study, we investigated baseline brain structural predictors for rapid symptom improvement after a single subanesthetic ketamine infusion. Furthermore, given the preclinical evidence and findings from a pilot study in a clinical population that ketamine induces rapid neuroplasticity, we performed an exploratory investigation of macroscopic changes 24 h post-treatment. T1-weighted MRI brain images from 33 depressed patients were acquired before and 24 h after a single ketamine infusion and analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM). Additionally, we performed a region of interest (ROI)-based analysis of structures that have previously been shown to play a role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine: bilateral hippocampus, nucleus accumbens, anterior cingulate cortex, and thalamus. A whole-brain regression analysis showed that greater baseline volume of the bilateral rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC) significantly predicts rapid symptom reduction. The right ACC showed the same association in the ROI analysis, while the other regions yielded no significant results. Exploratory follow-up analyses revealed no volumetric changes 24 h after treatment. This is the first study reporting an association between pretreatment gray matter volume of the bilateral rACC and the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine. Results are in line with previous investigations, which highlighted the potential of the rACC as a biomarker for response prediction to different antidepressant treatments. Ketamine-induced volumetric changes may be seen at later time points.

3598,"The Efficacy of Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis.^
Background: The use of psychedelic compounds to treat psychiatric disorders has become a very significant topic of research over the past several years. Psilocybin has risen to prominence as one of the most studied among these psychedelic compounds. Multiple trials have already shown that it can be a safe and efficacious treatment for various medical conditions. This study intends to perform a meta-analysis of data reported in clinical trials studying psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety. Methods: Articles were searched, screened, and ultimately selected using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was collected from commonly used psychometric tests that measured mood and anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated by comparing scores in these tests at baseline and control to experimental groups. Sub-group analysis was performed to assess psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety during short, medium, and long-term time frames. Results: Statistical significance was achieved in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to controls in multiple subgroups. Heterogeneity of the effect sizes was calculated using an I2 value which showed low to moderate values. Multiple tools were used to assess publication bias, and none could be found. Conclusion: Although research on psilocybin continues to show promise, the evidence is still at a preliminary phase, and more trials need to be conducted with larger patient populations over longer periods for psilocybin to potentially be approved in a community setting.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
3820,"Effect of baseline anxious depression on initial and sustained antidepressant response to ketamine.^
OBJECTIVE: Patients with anxious depression are typically more difficult to treat with monoaminergic antidepressants compared to those with nonanxious depression. Although novel research has shown that the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has rapidly acting, relatively sustained effects in treating depression, we predicted that, consistent with the existent literature on traditional antidepressants, patients with anxious depression would have a poorer antidepressant response. METHOD: Twenty-six inpatients with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) (DSM-IV criteria) received a single infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 minutes) from January 2006-March 2013 and were followed for 28 days. A post hoc analysis compared treatment response and relapse using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) in patients with anxious versus nonanxious depression. Anxious depression was defined as MDD plus a Hamilton Depression Rating Scale anxiety/somatization factor score ≥ 7. RESULTS: Both anxious and nonanxious depressed patients responded positively to ketamine. A linear mixed model controlling for baseline with the MADRS revealed a significant group main effect (P = .03) and group-by-time interaction (P = .01). Post hoc tests indicated that patients with anxious depression had significantly fewer depression symptoms compared to those with nonanxious depression at days 1 through 5, 9 through 12, 15 through 17, and 25, with no significant group differences in dissociative (P = .62) or psychotic (P = .41) side effects. Regarding responders, patients with anxious depression relapsed significantly later than those with nonanxious depression (median ± SE = 19.0 ± 17.9 vs 1.0 ± 0.0 days to relapse, respectively; χ² = 9.30; P = .002). CONCLUSIONS: Unexpectedly, patients with anxious depression responded better to ketamine than those with nonanxious depression, with longer time to relapse and no side effect differences. This finding gives promise for the role of novel glutamatergic medications for the treatment of those with anxious depression, a traditionally difficult-to-treat subgroup of depressed patients.

4916,"A single intravenous administration of a sub-anesthetic ketamine dose during the perioperative period of cesarean section for preventing postpartum depression: A meta-analysis.^
The feasibility of intravenous ketamine administration during the perioperative period of cesarean section to prevent postpartum depression (PPD) has not been determined by meta-analysis. To evaluate the efficacy, safety and dose of prophylactic ketamine in offsetting PPD, we retrieved the following databases in English or Chinese from inception to December 2020: Pubmed, Embase, Web of Science, The Cochrane Library, CNKI, VIP and Wanfang. A total of 10 studies (9 RCTs and 1 retrospective study) were included with 2087 cases. Meta-analysis showed that in ketamine group, the score and the prevalence of PPD within 1 week postpartum were significantly reduced, whereas PPD score after 4 weeks postpartum showed no superiority. There was no significant difference in terms of total adverse events rate, although vomiting occurred more frequently in the ketamine group. In addition, we found that ketamine efficacy emerged at 0.5 mg/kg. By meta-regression, we observed that: (1) Age and BMI are negatively associated with mood response to ketamine. (2) An analgesic pump containing ketamine for continuous 48 h postpartum administration was more efficacious than an intravenous injection of ketamine during cesarean section.

5020,"[Analgesia-sedation for maxillo-facial surgery with midazolam-pentazocine and miazolam-ketamine. Clinical double-blind study of anxiety, analgesia, sedation and amnesia].^
Ketamine and midazolam, applied as intravenous medication for conscious sedation in day-case maxillo-facial surgery, has been proven to be superior to pentazocine and midazolam concerning cardiovascular parameters and respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-dose ketamine/midazolam on anxiety, analgesia, amnesia and subjective feelings. METHODS. 140 out-patients (ASA I) were randomly divided into four groups. The double-blind study was prospective. CONTROL GROUP: Local anaesthesia (LA), articaine 4% plus epinephrine 1:200,000 (n = 35); test group P/M: LA, additional pentazocine 0.40 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35); test group K25/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.25 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35), test group K50/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.5 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35). LA was injected 3 min after application of the systemic medication in the test groups or application of a placebo (saline 0.9%) in the control group. Three further minutes later, operation was started. For evaluation questionnaires, visual analogue scales (VAS) and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were used. For testing retrograde and anterograde amnesia, acoustic sensations were delivered before application of the systemic medication (a Christmas carol) and during operation (the German national anthem). RESULTS. The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data, duration of operation, applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation. The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild, in contrast to the control group. Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups. Retrograde amnesia was not found in any group. Complete anterograde amnesia was observed in all test groups with respect to the intraoperative sensation, but even in the control group 50% of the patients did not remember having heard the national anthem. As subjective feelings negative criteria were mainly reported in the control group, where as in all test groups positive sensations dominated. Dreams were reported mostly after the higher dosage of ketamine, but no patient experienced any unpleasant dreams. The clinical assessment of the different regimes were excellent for test groups P/M and K50/M, modest for the control group and test group K25/M. Postoperatively, patients of test group P/M were remarkably sedated, but no clinically relevant sedation or motor weakness were observed in the other groups. Postoperative pain sensations were rated more intense in all test groups than in the control group. In test groups P/M and K25/M an increasing pain level was recorded during the postoperative period, with the consequence of a higher demand rate for analgesics. CONCLUSIONS. Dental surgery can be performed safely with low-dose ketamine/midazolam. Compared to pentazocine/midazolam, the higher dosage of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg bw) showed identical results intraoperatively, but was superior during the postoperative period (vigilance), and thus may represent a suitable dosage. The lower dosage of ketamine resulted in worse operating conditions, but a dosage higher than 0.5 mg/kg bw might lead to unconscious sedation and might increase the frequency of unpleasant dreams.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5276,"Naltrexone but Not Ketanserin Antagonizes the Subjective, Cardiovascular, and Neuroendocrine Effects of Salvinorin-A in Humans.^
BACKGROUND: Salvinorin-A is a terpene found in the leaves of the plant Salvia divinorum. When administered to humans, salvinorin-A induces an intense but short-lasting modified state of awareness, sharing features with those induced by the classical serotonin-2A receptor agonist psychedelics. However, unlike substances such as psilocybin or mescaline, salvinorin-A shows agonist activity at the kappa-opioid receptor rather than at the serotonin-2A receptor. Here, we assessed the involvement of kappa-opioid receptor and serotonin-2A agonism in the subjective, cardiovascular, and neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin-A in humans. METHODS: We conducted a placebo-controlled, randomized, double-blind study with 2 groups of 12 healthy volunteers with experience with psychedelic drugs. There were 4 experimental sessions. In group 1, participants received the following treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, naltrexone+placebo, and naltrexone+salvinorin-A. Naltrexone, a nonspecific opioid receptor antagonist, was administered at a dose of 50mg orally. In group 2, participants received the treatment combinations: placebo+placebo, placebo+salvinorin-A, ketanserin+placebo, and ketanserin+salvinorin-A. Ketanserin, a selective serotonin-2A antagonist, was administered at a dose of 40mg orally. RESULTS: Inhalation of 1mg of vaporized salvinorin-A led to maximum plasma concentrations at 1 and 2 minutes after dosing. When administered alone, salvinorin-A severely reduced external sensory perception and induced intense visual and auditory modifications, increased systolic blood pressure, and cortisol and prolactin release. These effects were effectively blocked by naltrexone, but not by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: Results support kappa opioid receptor agonism as the mechanism of action underlying the subjective and physiological effects of salvinorin-A in humans and rule out the involvement of a serotonin-2A-mediated mechanism.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5380,"Sub-Acute Effects of Psilocybin on Empathy, Creative Thinking, and Subjective Well-Being.^
Creative thinking and empathy are crucial for everyday interactions and subjective well-being. This is emphasized by studies showing a reduction in these skills in populations where social interaction and subjective well-being are significantly compromised (e.g., depression). Anecdotal reports and recent studies suggest that a single administration of psilocybin can enhance such processes and could therefore be a potential treatment. However, it has yet to be assessed whether effects outlast acute intoxication. The present study aimed to assess the sub-acute effects of psilocybin on creative thinking, empathy, and well-being. Participants attending a psilocybin retreat completed tests of creative (convergent and divergent) thinking and empathy, and the satisfaction with life scale on three occasions: before ingesting psilocybin (N = 55), the morning after (N = 50), and seven days after (N = 22). Results indicated that psilocybin enhanced divergent thinking and emotional empathy the morning after use. Enhancements in convergent thinking, valence-specific emotional empathy, and well-being persisted seven days after use. Sub-acute changes in empathy correlated with changes in well-being. The study demonstrates that a single administration of psilocybin in a social setting may be associated with sub-acute enhancement of creative thinking, empathy, and subjective well-being.

5705,"D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^
RATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
5968,"Effect of esketamine nasal spray on depressive symptoms in adults with severe major depressive disorder: a post hoc analysis of the aspire i and aspire ii studies.^
Background: ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II were 2 identically designed, global, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled phase 3 studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133) designed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of esketamine (ESK) nasal spray vs placebo (PBO) nasal spray, given in the context of comprehensive standard of care (SoC; ie, hospitalization, initiation, or optimization of antidepressant therapy), in adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) who had active suicidal ideation with intent. These studies were the basis for the recent approval of ESK for the treatment of depressive symptoms in adults with MDD with acute suicidal ideation or behavior. To further understand the rapid effect of ESK +SoC vs PBO+SoC on depressive symptoms in patients with severe depression at baseline, we conducted a post hoc analysis of pooled data from ASPIRE I and ASPIRE II to examine changes in Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total scores and Clinical Global Impression‐Severity of Suicidality‐Revised (CGI‐SS‐r) scores after ESK treatment. Methods: The ASPIRE I and II trials enrolled adults aged 18‐64 years with MDD confirmed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview and a minimum total MADRS score of >28 at baseline. Patients were randomized 1:1 to ESK 84 mg or PBO nasal spray twice weekly plus comprehensive SoC antidepressant treatment for 4 weeks. For this post hoc analysis, a subset of trial patients was identified as having severe depression per baseline total MADRS score >34 (Snaith Br J Psychiatry 1986). Change in MADRS total score was calculated from baseline to 4 hours post‐first dose, 24 hours post‐first dose, and predose on day 25 (ie, last day of double‐blind treatment phase). Differences between least squares mean (LSM) changes from baseline between groups in MADRS total score were examined using a mixed model for repeated measures. Percentages of subjects achieving response (ie, change in MADRS total score ≥50%) and remission (ie, MADRS total score ≤12) were also assessed using Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel tests. Generalized estimation equations were used to determine the relative odds of achieving a clinically meaningful improvement on the CGI‐SS‐r (≥1‐point decrease) scale with ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC. A multiplicity adjustment procedure was not carried out. Results: Of 450 patients enrolled in the trials, 370 (82.2%) had severe MDD at baseline, as defined by MADRS score, and were included in this post hoc analysis (n=189, ESK+SoC; n=181, PBO +SoC). Demographic and psychiatric characteristics were similar between ESK+SoC and PBO+SoC groups at baseline (mean age: 40.3; 61.4% female). Mean (SD) MADRS total scores were 41.9 (4.62) and 42.5 (4.64), respectively. The ESK+SoC group had significantly greater decreases from baseline in MADRS total score vs the PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (‐12.6 vs ‐8.6; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.0 [‐5.9, ‐2.1]; P<0.001), at 24 hourspost‐first dose (‐16.4 vs ‐11.7; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐4.7 [‐6.9, ‐2.5]; P<0.001), and on day 25 (‐26.0 vs ‐22.8; LSM difference [95% CI] ‐3.2 [‐5.8, ‐0.7]; P=0.013). Significantly more patients in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group attained response at 4 hours post‐first dose (24.5% vs 11.1%; P<0.001), at 24 hours post‐first dose (34.8% vs 22.4%; P=0.009), and on day 25 (76.7% vs 58.3%; P<0.001). The percentages of patients who attained remission were also greater in the ESK+SoC group vs PBO+SoC group at 4 hours post‐first dose (8.5% vs 2.8%; P=0.017), at 24 hours post‐first dose (18.2% vs 6.7%; P<0.001), and on day 25 (51.3% vs 36.1%; P=0.008). Patients in the ESK+SoC group were 78% more likely to experience a ≥1‐point decrease in CGI‐SS‐r score at 4 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 1.78 [1.15, 2.74]; P=0.009) and 99% more likely at 24 hours post‐first dose (odds ratio [95% CI] 199 [1.24, 3.20]; P=0.005] than patients in the PBO+SoC group. Conclusions: Similar to findings from the ASPIRE global phase 3 clinical trial program to assess e ficacy of ESK+SoC vs PBO+SoC in reducing depressive symptoms in adults with moderate to severe MDD and suicidal ideation with intent, patients with severe MDD, as defined by MADRS total score >34, demonstrated significant improvement in depressive symptoms when treated with ESK +SoC compared with PBO+SoC as early as 4 hours after the first ESK dose. Improvements in depressive symptoms continued in favor of ESK+SoC treatment through study end of the doubleblind treatment phase. Additional analyses will be conducted to assess efficacy outcomes in patients with severe MDD defined through other validated instruments. ESK+SoC may provide an effective treatment of depressive symptoms with continued significant benefit for this population with challenging‐to‐treat depression. Reference: Snaith RP et al.

6000,"A Test of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy in People With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^
Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) occurs in response to a traumatic event or events. It is most likely to occur following an event involving perceived personal threat, such as rape or physical assault. PTSD is clearly a public health problem that causes a great deal of suffering and accounts for a significant portion of health care costs. This study will examine whether two sessions of methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy can be safely administered to participants with PTSD, and whether MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy, when compared with placebo‐assisted therapy, will reduce PTSD symptoms after each session and two months after the second session. MDMA is a substance possessing unique effects that make it well suited to intensive psychotherapy. MDMA has been hypothesized to represent a new class of drugs, called entactogens, that produce feelings of closeness to others, empathy, well being, and insightfulness. Currently, MDMA is scheduled (illegal) and cannot be used outside of research studies like this one. Anecdotal reports of therapy conducted before MDMA was made illegal suggest that MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy may benefit people with PTSD. This study will examine MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in twenty people ages 18 to 70 with PTSD either related to crime victimization or combat, when combat‐related PTSD lasts no longer than five years, and that has not gotten better after psychotherapy and treatment with an SSRI (selective serotonin uptake inhibitor, such as Paxil). This study lasts three to four months. Participants attend up to fourteen (14) ordinary (non‐drug) psychotherapy sessions with the investigators as well as two eight hour long experimental (MDMA or placebo) sessions and one MDMA session. People taking part in this study cannot take any psychiatric medication during the study period. People will either get 125 mg MDMA or placebo ""by chance,"" as by coin‐toss, with twelve of twenty (60%) getting MDMA during each experimental session, and eight of twenty (40%) getting placebo. Two to two and a half hours later, if you and the investigators agree it is alright, you will take a second supplemental, dose of MDMA or placebo. The supplemental dose will be half the size of the first dose. The same investigators conducting non‐drug therapy sessions conduct the experimental sessions. All participants are required to stay the night at the clinic after each experimental session. Participants meet with the investigators for a non‐drug assisted therapy session the day after each experimental session. A third MDMA session in this placebo‐controlled stage of the study will only be for people who received MDMA in the first two sessions. PTSD symptoms are measured at the start of the study, four days after each experimental session, and finally two months after the second experimental session. People are tested on memory and problem solving when they first enter the study and again two months after the second experimental session. PTSD symptoms are measured to see whether there are any changes in symptoms during the study, and tests of thinking, memory and problem‐solving are meant to spot any changes that could be due to MDMA or MDMA‐assisted therapy. Participants who recieved MDMA who complete the final evaluation, and upon discussion with the investigators, will undergo a third MDMA session. The third session will happen approximately two months after the second experimental session This session is ""open label,"" meaning that they and the investigators will both know they are receiving MDMA. It will be followed by one psychotherapy session a day after this session and two additional psychotherapy sessions in the following weeks. PTSD symptoms will be measured again two months after the third MDMA session. Participants who received placebo and complete the final evaluation two months after the second experimental procedure will be given an opportunity to take part in an open‐label continuation of the study where they will receive an initial dose of 125 mg MDMA and a supplemental dose of 62.5 mg MDMA in up to three experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart. Participants in this open‐label continuation will act as their own controls. The open‐label continuation lasts three months and will involve nine more visits with the investigators, including the two experimental sessions.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6015,"Interaction Between Duloxetine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy).^
3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine through an interaction with the corresponding presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter. 5‐HT transport inhibitors block MDMA‐induced 5‐HT release in vitro or in animals and also attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA in humans. NE transport inhibitors similarly prevent the MDMA‐induced release of NE in cell assays and attenuate behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. Effects of the NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the response to MDMA in humans are currently investigated. Here we suggest evaluating effects of pretreatment with the combined 5‐HT and NE transport blocker duloxetine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The study will use a randomized double‐blind cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Duloxetine (120 mg) or placebo will be administered 16 h and 4 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers.

6044,"Psilocybin-facilitated Smoking Cessation Treatment: a Pilot Study.^
One of the most promising lines of investigation for the therapeutic use of hallucinogens in the 1960s and 1970s was in the treatment of drug dependence. We propose to examine psilocybin administration combined with a structured smoking cessation treatment program in nicotine dependent individuals in order to provide preliminary data on the efficacy of this combined treatment for smoking cessation. Prior work in our laboratory has shown that under carefully prepared and supportive conditions, psilocybin administration can facilitate highly salient experiences with enduring personal meaning and spiritual significance (Griffiths et al., 2006, 2008). It is plausible that embedding such highly meaningful experiences into a drug dependence cessation attempt may provide an enduring motivation for remaining abstinent. Cigarette smoking is a good model system for studying drug dependence because users are less likely to be challenged by the many social and economic impairments that often accompany dependence on other drugs such as cocaine, heroin, or alcohol. More specifically, we propose to conduct a randomized controlled comparative efficacy study in which either psilocybin or transdermal nicotine patch are administered under highly supportive conditions to individuals who are nicotine‐dependent cigarette smokers, who have had multiple unsuccessful quit attempts, and who continue to desire to quit smoking. Other than nicotine dependence, participants will be healthy. Fifteen participants have already completed a preliminary open‐label pilot‐study with no control condition. Eighty additional participants will be enrolled and randomized to either psilocybin (n=40), or nicotine patch (n=40) treatment. Participants will receive a 13‐week course of cognitive behavioral therapy for smoking cessation, with Target Quit Date set for week 5. After several preparation meetings with study monitors, participants will have either a single day‐long psilocybin session using a high dose (30 mg/70 kg), or a standard 8 to 10‐week course of nicotine patch treatment. Participant smoking status will be assessed repeatedly for 8 weeks after the Target Quit Date, including biological verification of smoking status through breath and urine samples. Smoking status will also be assessed at three follow up sessions approximately 3, 6, and 12 months after the Target Quit Date. Additionally, 50 of these participants (25 per treatment condition) will undergo MRI scanning before and after Target Quit Date to assess the brain‐based mechanisms associated with these treatments. Individuals assigned to the nicotine patch study treatment condition will be eligible to undergo an optional high dose psilocybin session after completing the 6‐month follow‐up meeting.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
6103,"A Multi-Site Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD.^
PTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg).

6855,"Psychiatric safety of ketamine in psychopharmacology research.^
RATIONALE: A growing number of investigators are studying ketamine effects in healthy human subjects, but concerns remain about its safety as a research tool. Therefore, it is timely to revisit the safety of subanesthetic doses of ketamine in experimental psychopharmacology studies. OBJECTIVE: To report on the safety of laboratory studies with subanesthetic doses of ketamine in healthy humans using an existing dataset. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Medically healthy subjects with no personal or familial Axis I psychotic spectrum disorders were administered subanesthetic doses of ketamine by intravenous infusion in a series of clinical investigations from 1989 to 2005. The safety of ketamine administration was monitored in these subjects. RESULTS: Four hundred and fifty subjects received at least one dose of active ketamine. Eight hundred and thirty three active ketamine and 621 placebo infusions were administered. Ten adverse mental status events were documented in nine subjects/infusions that were deemed related to ketamine administration (2% of subjects, 1.45% of infusions). All but one adverse reaction resolved by the end of the test session. The side effects in the remaining individual were no longer clinically significant within 4 days of the test session. No residual sequelae were observed. CONCLUSION: Ketamine administration at subanesthetic doses appears to present an acceptable level of risk for carefully screened populations of healthy human subjects in the context of clinical research programs that intensively monitor subjects throughout their study participation.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7174,"Altered State of Consciousness and Mental Imagery as a Function of N, N-dimethyltryptamine Concentration in Ritualistic Ayahuasca Users.^
Consumption of the psychedelic brew ayahuasca is a central ritualistic aspect of the Santo Daime religion. The current observational, baseline controlled study was designed to assess whether members (n = 24) of the Santo Daime church would show enhanced capacity for mental imagery during an ayahuasca experience. In addition, this study assessed whether the effects of ayahuasca on consciousness and mental imagery were related to peak serum concentration of N, N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), the main psychoactive component. Measures of altered states of consciousness (5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire) and ego dissolution (Ego Dissolution Inventory [EDI]) as well as measures of mental imagery (visual perspective shifting, vividness of visual imagery, cognitive flexibility, associative thinking) were taken on two subsequent days on which members of Santo Daime were sober or drank a self-selected volume of ayahuasca. Measures of altered states of consciousness revealed that feelings of oceanic boundlessness, visual restructuralization, and EDI increased most prominently after drinking and shared a positive correlation with peak DMT concentration. Measures of mental imagery did not noticeably differ between the baseline and ayahuasca condition, although subjective ratings of cognitive flexibility were lower under ayahuasca. Two measures related to mental imagery, that is, perspective shifts and cognitive flexibility, were significantly correlated to peak DMT concentrations. Peak concentrations of DMT and other alkaloids did not correlate with ayahuasca dose. These findings confirm previous notions that the primary phenomenological characteristics of ayahuasca are driven by DMT. Compensatory or neuroadaptive effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake may have mitigated the acute impact of ayahuasca in Santo Daime members on mental imagery.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
7190,"Attenuation of ketamine-induced impairment in verbal learning and memory in healthy volunteers by the AMPA receptor potentiator PF-04958242.^
There is a need to develop treatments for cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia (CIAS). The significant role played by N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) in both the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and in neuronal plasticity suggests that facilitation of NMDAR function might ameliorate CIAS. One strategy to correct NMDAR hypofunction is to stimulate α-amino-3- hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs) as AMPAR and NMDAR functioning are coupled and interdependent. In rats and nonhuman primates (NHP), AMPAR potentiators reduce spatial working memory deficits caused by the nonselective NMDAR antagonist ketamine. The current study assessed whether the AMPAR potentiator PF-04958242 would attenuate ketamine-induced deficits in verbal learning and memory in humans. Healthy male subjects (n = 29) participated in two randomized treatment periods of daily placebo or PF-04958242 for 5 days separated by a washout period. On day 5 of each treatment period, subjects underwent a ketamine infusion for 75 min during which the effects of PF-04958242/placebo were assessed on ketamine-induced: (1) impairments in verbal learning and recall measured by the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test; (2) impairments in working memory on a CogState battery; and (3) psychotomimetic effects measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale. PF-04958242 significantly reduced ketamine-induced impairments in immediate recall and the 2-Back and spatial working memory tasks (CogState Battery), without significantly attenuating ketamine-induced psychotomimetic effects. There were no pharmacokinetic interactions between PF-04958242 and ketamine. Furthermore, PF-04958242 was well tolerated. ‘High-impact’ AMPAR potentiators like PF-04958242 may have a role in the treatment of the cognitive symptoms, but not the positive or negative symptoms, associated with schizophrenia. The excellent concordance between the preclinical (rat, NHP) and human studies with PF-04958242, and in silico modeling of AMPAR–NMDAR interactions in the hippocampus, highlights the translational value of this study.

7860,"Debunking the myth of 'Blue Mondays': No evidence of affect drop after taking clinical MDMA.^
BACKGROUND: Incorporating 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to psychotherapy has shown promise in recent years for treating various mental health conditions, particularly those involving trauma. However, concerns about declines in mood and cognition during the days following dosing, also known as 'Blue Mondays', have been raised as limitations to its clinical use. Although these changes have been well-documented among recreational users, there are critical confounds to these reports that limit generalizability to clinically administered MDMA. AIMS: Here, we aimed to evaluate the evidence basis for the negative side effects associated with MDMA as well as inform our understanding of the drug's post-acute effects in a clinical context with an open-label study. METHODS: The current open-label study examined MDMA therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD; N = 14) and measured mood, sleep quality, illicit MDMA consumption and anecdotal reports after the acute drug effects had worn off. RESULTS: Participants maintained a positive mood during the week following drug administration in a clinical context. Relative to baseline, self-reported sleep quality improved at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Finally, no participants reported using or desiring to use illicit MDMA, and the anecdotal reports indicated that they perceived the treatment favourably. CONCLUSION: The results support the overall safety and tolerability of clinically administered MDMA and, importantly, suggest that the 'come downs' previously associated with the substance may be explained by confounds in research relating to the illicit sourcing of the drug and specific environmental setting for recreational consumption.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8596,"Mood and impulsivity of recreational Ecstasy users in the week following a ""rave"".^
Two days following widely attended ""rave"" or dance party events, questionnaires assessing mood (Beck Depression Inventory, or BDI-II) and impulsivity (Impulsiveness, Venturesomeness and Empathy Scale, or IVE) were completed by 43 attendees who reported using Ecstasy at the events, and by 31 Ecstasy-naïve controls who attended the same events. Participants who had taken Ecstasy at the events were significantly more depressed two days later than controls, according to analysis of their BDI-II scores. There was no group difference in impulsivity as measured by the IVE. Levels of self-reported Ecstasy use were not related to depression or impulsivity scores. Results are considered in terms of the hypothetical mood effect of short-term depletion of serotonin induced by MDMA, as well as several alternative non-pharmacological explanations.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8606,"Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^
BACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
8889,"Acute effects of intravenous DMT in a randomized placebo-controlled study in healthy participants.^
N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is distinct among classic serotonergic psychedelics because of its short-lasting effects when administered intravenously. Despite growing interest in the experimental and therapeutic use of intravenous DMT, data are lacking on its clinical pharmacology. We conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 27 healthy participants to test different intravenous DMT administration regimens: placebo, low infusion (0.6 mg/min), high infusion (1 mg/min), low bolus + low infusion (15 mg + 0.6 mg/min), and high bolus + high infusion (25 mg + 1 mg/min). Study sessions lasted for 5 h and were separated by at least 1 week. Participant's lifetime use of psychedelics was ≤20 times. Outcome measures included subjective, autonomic, and adverse effects, pharmacokinetics of DMT, and plasma levels of brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF) and oxytocin. Low (15 mg) and high (25 mg) DMT bolus doses rapidly induced very intense psychedelic effects that peaked within 2 min. DMT infusions (0.6 or 1 mg/min) without a bolus induced slowly increasing and dose-dependent psychedelic effects that reached plateaus after 30 min. Both bolus doses produced more negative subjective effects and anxiety than infusions. After stopping the infusion, all drug effects rapidly decreased and completely subsided within 15 min, consistent with a short early plasma elimination half-life (t(1/2α)) of 5.0-5.8 min, followed by longer late elimination (t(1/2β) = 14-16 min) after 15-20 min. Subjective effects of DMT were stable from 30 to 90 min, despite further increasing plasma concentrations, thus indicating acute tolerance to continuous DMT administration. Intravenous DMT, particularly when administered as an infusion, is a promising tool for the controlled induction of a psychedelic state that can be tailored to the specific needs of patients and therapeutic sessions.Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04353024.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
9175,"Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^
INTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Further study and optimization of this treatment approach in well-powered clinical trials is recommended.",0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0
