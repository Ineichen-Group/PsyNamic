"382","Spectral Changes of EEG Following a 6-Week Low-Dose Oral Ketamine Treatment in Adults With Major Depressive Disorder and Chronic Suicidality.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has considerable therapeutic potential in alleviating major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality. However, the clinical diagnosis of neuropsychiatric disorders requires more robust diagnostic criteria. Electroencephalography (EEG) has shown promise in classifying depressive and suicidal patients from healthy individuals. The present study aimed to identify changes in the spectral properties of EEG in patients with major depressive disorder and chronic suicidality after completing the 6-week Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality with follow-up occurring 4 weeks after final ketamine treatment and determine associations between EEG spectral output and clinical symptoms. METHODS: Participants (n = 25) had 4-minute eyes closed resting state EEG recorded at frontal, temporal, centro-parietal, and occipital regions. Spectral analysis was performed with Welch's power spectrum density method, and the power of 4 distinct frequency bands was analyzed: theta, alpha, low-beta, and high-beta. Correlation analyses between changes in clinical symptoms and spectral power were conducted using Spearman's ranked correlation. RESULTS: Between pre- and posttreatment, only centro-parietal alpha power decreased. Between posttreatment and follow-up, centro-parietal alpha increased again in addition to increases in temporal alpha, centro-parietal and temporal theta, and occipital low-beta and decreases in occipital theta and temporal low-beta. Additionally, the decrease of occipital theta positively correlated with clinical subscales for depression and stress. CONCLUSIONS: EEG spectral analysis revealed significant changes in theta, alpha, and low-beta frequency bands. Alpha band showed initial changes after treatment; however, this trended back toward baseline levels after the treatment cessation. In contrast, theta and low-beta showed significant power changes only after the treatment had ended.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"3100","Psychological effects of (S)-ketamine and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT): a double-blind, cross-over study in healthy volunteers.^\nINTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"3533","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) and alcohol interactions in humans: psychomotor performance, subjective effects, and pharmacokinetics.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is frequently consumed in association with alcohol. The effect of this combination in humans has not been previously investigated. Nine male healthy volunteers received single oral doses of 100 mg of MDMA plus 0.8 g/kg ethanol, 100 mg of MDMA, 0.8 g/kg of ethanol, and placebo in a double blind, double dummy, randomized crossover trial. Measurements included psychomotor performance, subjective effects, and pharmacokinetics. Plasma concentrations of MDMA showed a 13% increase after the use of alcohol, whereas plasma concentrations of alcohol showed a 9 to 15% decrease after MDMA administration. The MDMA-alcohol combination induced longer lasting euphoria and well being than MDMA or alcohol alone. MDMA reversed the subjective sedation induced by alcohol but did not reduce drunkenness feelings. MDMA did not reverse the actions of alcohol on psychomotor abilities. Combined use of MDMA and alcohol causes dissociation between subjective and objective sedation. Subjects may feel euphoric and less sedated and might have the feeling of doing better, but actual performance ability continues to be impaired by the effect of alcohol. Confirmation of these findings in further studies will be highly relevant in terms of road safety.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4410","Phase II, randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Esketamine as an adjunct to standard care in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder- OCD.^\nINTERVENTION: D27.505.954.427.700.122 In a crossover design, all participants will receive an infusion of 0.045mg/kg midazolam (active placebo) and another infusion of 0.5mg/kg esketamine, with an interval of two weeks between procedures. All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump. Randomization will be performed in blocks, ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine. Crossing between the blocks will be performed, so that all patients receive both interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned into two distinct groups through a list of random numbers, keeping allocation concealment preserved. Regarding masking, the same investigator responsible for the allocation will prepare the drugs. Study solutions will be provided in identical 50mL syringes containing midazolam or escetamine with the additional volume of saline solution for a total of 50mL. Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline, making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection. The active placebo used, midazolam, is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms, that is, it does not worsen and does not treat. It is a short‐acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action, a short elimination half‐life, and a similar time course of dissociative and non‐specific behavioral effects (eg, sedation, disorientation) to escetamine, thus providing adequate blinding ( Shiroma, 2020). Such medication is widely used in clinical trials (Peyrovian, 2020; Dakwar, 2020; Rothberg, 2020), with data in the literature proving the safety of its use in OCD patients (Bloch 2012, Rodriguez 2017). The sample size cannot be estima CONDITION: obsessive‐compulsive disorder PRIMARY OUTCOME: To compare of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms between the control group and the placebo group from the reduction in the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale score 24h after the infusion, compared to the score before each procedure. It is expected to find a significant reduction, i.e. greater than or equal to 35% in the total score on the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale. A mixed linear fixed effects model will be used to examine the differences between esketamine and midazolam treatment. A composite symmetry covariance structure appears to be the best fit to the data. The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data. Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests. Significance is assessed at P < 0.05, two‐tailed. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To assess changes from baseline scores for 24h, 7, and 14 days after each infusion in the placebo and control groups on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity and Improvement and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the change in the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale total score before each infusion to 7 and 14 days after the procedure between the placebo group and the control group. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the proportion of responders (participants who achieved a reduction of at least 35% of symptoms by the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale) of the placebo group and the control group after 24h, 7 and 14 days after each infusion. To assess the proportion of individuals who respond or remit at each point, a McNemar test will be used at each point for the participants and the results will be Bonferroni corrected for the number of points examined. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used to compare severity of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms, severity of depressive symptoms (if any) and percentage of cumulative reduction of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms compared to percentage of reduction of depressive symptoms; To evaluate clinical and biological markers (peripheral biomarkers such as BDNF, IL‐1, IK6, TNF‐alpha, IF , microRNAs and serum esketamine level) and their correspondence with therapeutic response. We will use t‐tests to assess differences in the dosages of these markers at different collection periods and between treatment groups. Pearson's correlation analysis will be used to determine the relationship between Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale scores and serum marker levels. Finally, a linear regression model will be used to evaluate the effect of each marker as a possible predictor of Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale scores.

"5738","The Effects of MDMA and Methamphetamine on Feelings of Closeness and Connection During Semi-Structured Conversations With Strangers.^\nBackground: MDMA is classified as an “empathogenic” drug, as it increases feelings of empathy and closeness to others. These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi‐structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within‐subject, double‐blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18‐35 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in‐lab sessions separated by 72 hours. During peak drug effect, they engaged in a 45 min semi‐structured conversation with a novel same‐sex partner. Subjective mood, physiological, and oxytocin levels were obtained at regular intervals, and subjects rated feelings of closeness and connection with their partners at the end of each session and one week later. Results: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased ratings of feeling connected to the partner, and increased ratings of enjoyment and meaningfulness of the conversation, relative to placebo (Study 1 MDMA; p=0.009 and Study 2 methamphetamine p=0.01). Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased subjective ratings of “sociable,” “loving,” and “friendly.” Only MDMA increased ratings of “trusting,” “grateful,” and “appreciated,” and only methamphetamine increased ratings of “understood” MDMA (p=0.001), and to a lesser extent methamphetamine (p=0.02) increased salivary oxytocin levels. Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs. This study provides a model for future studies assessing effects of drugs on interpersonal interactions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"6563","The relation between naturalistic use of psychedelics and perception of emotional stimuli: An event-related potential study comparing non-users and experienced users of classic psychedelics.^\nBackground: Previous research has suggested that controlled administration of psychedelic substances can modulate emotional reactivity, enhancing positive and diminishing negative emotions. However, it is unclear whether similar effects are associated with using psychedelics in less-controlled naturalistic environments. Aims: This cross-sectional study investigated the neural markers associated with the perception of emotional stimuli in individuals with extensive experience of naturalistic psychedelic use (15 or more lifetime experiences), comparing them to non-users. Methods: Electroencephalography (EEG) signals were recorded from two groups: experienced psychedelics users (N = 56) and non-users (N = 55). Participants were presented with facial images depicting neutral or emotional expressions (anger, sadness, and happiness). Event-related potential (ERP) components were analyzed as indices of emotional reactivity. Results: Psychedelic users were characterized by significantly lower amplitudes of the N200 component in response to fearful faces, in comparison to non-users. In addition, interaction effects between Group and Emotional expression were observed on N170 and N200 amplitudes, indicating group differences in the processing of fearful faces. However, no significant between-group differences emerged in the analysis of later ERP components associated with attention and cognitive processes (P200 and P300). Conclusions: The results suggest that naturalistic use of psychedelics may be linked to reduced reactivity to emotionally negative stimuli at the early and automatic processing stages. Our study contributes to a better understanding of the effects related to using psychedelics in naturalistic contexts.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"996","Psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine: Dose versus effect relationships.^\nPsychotomimetic emergence phenomena following general anesthesia with ketamine are well documented, and affect 5-30% of patients. The psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been less well studied. We administered ketamine or saline in single blinded, crossover fashion to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using a computer-assisted continuous ketamine infusion that achieved a stepwise series of 5 constant plasma levels of ketamine, at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 jug/ml. After approximately 20 min at each level, to allow for equilibration with the biophase, the volunteer completed a visual analog rating of 13 psychotic and dissociative symptom scales involving color, reality, sounds, body parts, ideas of reference, surroundings, time, euphoria, out-of-control thoughts, anxiety, drowsiness and suspiciousness. Target ketamine levels were verified by measuring actual plasma concentration. Ketamine produced marked psychotomimetic effects that were doserelated in a highly linear fashion for all scales (r 0.92; p 0.03). Effects on anxiety, suspiciousness, and ideas of reference were weakest, attaining less than 22% of the maximum possible effect.

"1745","Reduced auditory evoked gamma-band response and schizophrenia-like clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nAbnormal gamma-band oscillations (GBO) have been frequently associated with the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. GBO are modulated by glutamate, a neurotransmitter, which is continuously discussed to shape the complex symptom spectrum in schizophrenia. The current study examined the effects of ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, on the auditory-evoked gamma-band response (aeGBR) and psychopathological outcomes in healthy volunteers to investigate neuronal mechanisms of psychotic behavior. In a placebo-controlled, randomized crossover design, the aeGBR power, phase-locking factor (PLF) during a choice reaction task, the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) Rating Scale were assessed in 25 healthy subjects. Ketamine was applied in a subanaesthetic dose. Low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography was used for EEG source localization. Significant reductions of the aeGBR power and PLF were identified under ketamine administration compared to placebo (p < 0.01). Source-space analysis of aeGBR generators revealed significantly reduced current source density (CSD) within the anterior cingulate cortex during ketamine administration. Ketamine induced an increase in all PANSS (p < 0.001) as well as 5D-ASC scores (p < 0.01) and increased response times (p < 0.001) and error rates (p < 0.01). Only negative symptoms were significantly associated with an aeGBR power decrease (p = 0.033) as revealed by multiple linear regression. These findings argue for a substantial role of the glutamate system in the mediation of dysfunctional gamma band responses and negative symptomatology of schizophrenia and are compatible with the NMDAR hypofunction hypothesis of schizophrenia.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4798","Ketamine as a novel treatment for major depressive disorder and bipolar depression: a systematic review and quantitative meta-analysis.^\nOBJECTIVE: Given the significant disability, morbidity and mortality associated with depression, the promising recent trials of ketamine highlight a novel intervention. A meta-analysis was conducted to assess the efficacy of ketamine in comparison with placebo for the reduction of depressive symptoms in patients who meet criteria for a major depressive episode. METHOD: Two electronic databases were searched in September 2013 for English-language studies that were randomized placebo-controlled trials of ketamine treatment for patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression and utilized a standardized rating scale. Studies including participants receiving electroconvulsive therapy and adolescent/child participants were excluded. Five studies were included in the quantitative meta-analysis. RESULTS: The quantitative meta-analysis showed that ketamine significantly reduced depressive symptoms. The overall effect size at day 1 was large and statistically significant with an overall standardized mean difference of 1.01 (95% confidence interval 0.69-1.34) (P<.001), with the effects sustained at 7 days postinfusion. The heterogeneity of the studies was low and not statistically significant, and the funnel plot showed no publication bias.

Recent clinical trial evidence has stimulated interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelics at end of life. Much uncertainty remains, however, mainly due to methodological difficulties that beset existing trials. We conducted a scoping review of pipeline clinical trials of psychedelic treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress at end of life. METHODS: Proposed, registered, and ongoing trials were identified from 2 electronic databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). Recent reviews and both commercial and non-profit organization websites were used to identify additional unregistered trials. RESULTS: In total, 25 studies were eligible, including 13 randomized controlled trials and 12 open-label trials. Three trials made attempts beyond randomization to assess expectancy and blinding effectiveness. Investigational drugs included ketamine (n = 11), psilocybin (n = 10), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (n = 2), and lysergic acid diethylamide (n = 2). Three trials involved microdosing, and fifteen trials incorporated psychotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: A variety of onging or upcoming clinical trials are expected to usefully extend evidence regarding psychedelic-assisted group therapy and microdosing in the end-of-life setting. Still needed are head-to-head comparisons of different psychedelics to identify those best suited to specific indications and clinical populations.

METHODS: We analysed all patients with acute recreational drug toxicity included by the Euro-DEN Plus dataset (22 EDs in 14 European countries) between October 2013 and December 2016 (39 months). Drugs were grouped as: opioids, cocaine, cannabis, amphetamines, gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), hallucinogens, new psychoactive substances (NPS), benzodiazepines and ketamine. Descriptive data by age and sex are presented and compared among age/sex categories and among drug families. RESULTS: Of 17,371 patients were included during the 39-month period, 17,198 (99.0%) had taken at least one of the investigated drugs (median age: 31 years; 23.9% female; ethanol co-ingestion recorded in 41.5%, unknown in 31.2%; multiple drug use in 37.9%). Opioids (in 31.4% of patients) and amphetamines (23.3%) were the most frequently involved and hallucinogens (1.9%) and ketamine (1.7%) the least. Overall, female patients were younger than males, both in the whole cohort (median age 29 vs. 32 years; p < 0.001) and in all drug groups except benzodiazepines (median age 36 vs. 36 years; p = 0.83). The relative proportion of each drug group was different at every age strata and some patterns could be clearly described: cannabis, NPS and hallucinogens were the most common in patients <20 years; amphetamines, ketamine and cocaine in the 20- to 39-year group; GHB/GBL in the 30- to 39-year group; and opioids and benzodiazepines in patients ≥40 years. Ethanol and other drug co-ingestion was more frequent at middle-ages, and multidrug co-ingestion was more common in females than males. CONCLUSION: Differences in the drugs involved in acute drug toxicity presentations according to age and sex may be relevant for developing drug-prevention and education programs for some particular subgroups of the population based on the increased risk of adverse events in specific sex and/or age strata.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

"5705","D-serine plasma concentration is a potential biomarker of (R,S)-ketamine antidepressant response in subjects with treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: (R,S)-ketamine is a rapid and effective antidepressant drug that produces a response in two thirds of patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The underlying biochemical differences between a (R,S)-ketamine responder (KET-R) and non-responder (KET-NR) have not been definitively identified but may involve serine metabolism. OBJECTIVES: The aim of the study was to examine the relationship between baseline plasma concentrations of D-serine and its precursor L-serine and antidepressant response to (R,S)-ketamine in TRD patients. METHODS: Plasma samples were obtained from 21 TRD patients at baseline, 60 min before initiation of the (R,S)-ketamine infusion. Patients were classified as KET-Rs (n = 8) or KET-NRs (n = 13) based upon the difference in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores at baseline and 230 min after infusion, with response defined as a ≥50 % decrease in MADRS score. The plasma concentrations of D-serine and L-serine were determined using liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry. RESULTS: Baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs (3.02 ± 0.21 μM) than in KET-NRs (4.68 ± 0.81 μM), p < 0.001. A significant relationship between baseline D-serine plasma concentrations and percent change in MADRS at 230 min was determined using a Pearson correlation, r = 0.77, p < 0.001, with baseline D-serine explaining 60 % of the variance in (R,S)-ketamine response. The baseline concentrations of L-serine (L-Ser) in KET-Rs were also significantly lower than those measured in KET-NRs (66.2 ± 9.6 μM vs 242.9 ± 5.6 μM, respectively; p < 0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: The results demonstrate that the baseline D-serine plasma concentrations were significantly lower in KET-Rs than in KET-NRs and suggest that this variable can be used to predict an antidepressant response following (R,S)-ketamine administration.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects.

"558","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^\nOBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

We found that the ketamine administration caused an altered state of consciousness and changes in systemic physiology (e.g. increase in pulse rate and electrodermal activity). Furthermore, ketamine led to a brain-wide reduction in the fractional amplitude of low frequency fluctuations, and a decrease in the global brain connectivity of the prefrontal region. Lastly, we provide preliminary evidence that a combination of neural and physiological metrics may serve as predictors of subjective mystical experiences and reductions in depressive symptomatology. Overall, our study demonstrated the successful application of fNIRS neuroimaging to study the physiological effects of the psychoactive substance ketamine in humans, and can be regarded as an important step toward larger scale clinical fNIRS studies that can quantify the impact of psychedelics on the brain in standard clinical settings.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1455","Effects of Low-Dose Ketamine on the Antidepressant Efficacy and Suicidal Ideations in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nOBJECTIVES: It remains controversial whether a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could modulate the antidepressant effect of electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depressive disorder. We investigated the effect of ketamine on accelerating the antidepressant efficacy of ECT. METHODS: One hundred twenty-seven patients with major depressive disorder were included in this randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. The study group received 0.3 mg/kg ketamine, and the control group received an isovolumetric dose of normal saline before undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. The main outcome was the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale score after each ECT session. Suicidal ideation (SI) was also evaluated using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale. The response, remission, and recurrence rates were analyzed using time-to-event analysis. RESULTS: No significant differences were found in the overall response, remission, and relapse rates between the groups (P > 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving response was 4.0 ± 0.41 in the study group and 7.0 ± 0.79 in the control group (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving remission in the study and control groups was 8.0 ± 0.29 and 9.0 ± 0.48, respectively (P < 0.05). The median number of ECT sessions for achieving SI reduction in the study and control groups was 3.0 ± 0.75 and 6.0 ± 1.19, respectively (P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Low-dose ketamine (0.3 mg/kg) could modulate the antidepressant efficacy of ECT via accelerating the onset of its effects and reducing the number of ECT sessions required to obtain response, remission, and SI reduction, without influencing the relapse rates in remitting patients after ECT treatment.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"1749","Mood and cognitive effects of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'): Week-end 'high' followed by mid-week low.^\nAims. Recreational use of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is widespread. The present study aimed to examine both the acute and residual effects of this drug on users' mood and cognitive function. Design and participants. A parallel group design was used to compare 12 participants who reported having taken MDMA with 12 participants who reported having consumed only alcohol, on the relevant night (day 1). These same participants were then re-assessed the following day (day 2) and again mid-week (day 5). Findings. Acute effects of MDMA broadly replicated previous findings. MDMA users rated elevated mood on day 1 but significantly low mood on day 5, at which point some participants scored within the range for clinical depression. In contrast, the alcohol group showed less pronounced changes, which followed a U-shaped curve over days with the lowest point being day 2. The MDMA group also showed significant impairments on an attentional/working memory task, compared with alcohol users. Conclusions. Weekend use of MDMA may lead to depressed mood mid-week. Possible mechanisms underlying the findings are discussed in terms of temporary depletion of serotonin, serotonergic neurotoxity and psychological aspects of mood change.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"1765","Nicotine fails to attenuate ketamine-induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms in humans: implications for schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist, ketamine, induces a range of symptoms resembling those seen in schizophrenia. Enhancement of nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) function may have potential as a treatment for the cognitive deficits and negative symptoms of schizophrenia. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nAChR systems on NMDAR antagonist-induced effects. METHODS: The interactive effects of ketamine and nicotine were evaluated in 37 healthy subjects in a randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover counterbalanced, 2 (intravenous ketamine or placebo) × 2 (intravenous nicotine or placebo) design. Verbal and visual memory, sustained attention, working memory, response inhibition, emotion recognition, executive function, reaction time, motor function, and speed of processing were assessed once per test day, while negative and positive symptoms, perceptual alterations, and a number of feeling states were measured several times before and after administration of drugs. RESULTS: Ketamine induced cognitive deficits and negative and positive symptoms. Nicotine worsened immediate recall, auditory working memory, response inhibition, and executive function and serial processing. Nicotine decreased (improved) reaction time on the sustained attention and choice reaction time tasks. Nicotine did not reduce ketamine-induced cognitive deficits or negative and positive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: At blood levels comparable with tobacco smoking, nicotine infusion does not appear to alleviate the ketamine-induced transient cognitive and behavioral effects in healthy subjects that resemble those seen in schizophrenia. The lack of an effect of nicotine on a spectrum of ketamine effects suggests that the consequences of NMDAR antagonism are not likely under the direct influence of nAChR.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"2031","Evidence for chronically altered serotonin function in the cerebral cortex of female 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine polydrug users.^\nCONTEXT: MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, also popularly known as ""ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that produces loss of serotonin axons in animal models. Whether MDMA produces chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in humans remains controversial. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether MDMA use is associated with chronic reductions in serotonin signaling in the cerebral cortex of women as reflected by increased serotonin(2A) receptor levels. DESIGN: Cross-sectional case-control study comparing serotonin(2A) receptor levels in abstinent female MDMA polydrug users with those in women who did not use MDMA (within-group design assessing the association of lifetime MDMA use and serotonin(2A) receptors). Case participants were abstinent from MDMA use for at least 90 days as verified by analysis of hair samples. The serotonin(2A) receptor levels in the cerebral cortex were determined using serotonin(2A)-specific positron emission tomography with radioligand fluorine 18-labeled setoperone as the tracer. SETTING: Academic medical center research laboratory. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 14 female MDMA users and 10 women who did not use MDMA (controls). The main exclusion criteria were nondrug-related DSM-IV Axis I psychiatric disorders and general medical illness. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Cortical serotonin(2A) receptor nondisplaceable binding potential (serotonin(2A)BP(ND)). RESULTS: MDMA users had increased serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in occipital-parietal (19.7%), temporal (20.5%), occipitotemporal-parietal (18.3%), frontal (16.6%), and frontoparietal (18.5%) regions (corrected P < .05). Lifetime MDMA use was positively associated with serotonin(2A)BP(ND) in frontoparietal (β = 0.665; P = .007), occipitotemporal (β = 0.798; P = .002), frontolimbic (β = 0.634; P = .02), and frontal (β = 0.691; P = .008) regions. In contrast, there were no regions in which MDMA use was inversely associated with receptor levels. There were no statistically significant effects of the duration of MDMA abstinence on serotonin(2A)BP(ND). CONCLUSIONS: The recreational use of MDMA is associated with long-lasting increases in serotonin(2A) receptor density. Serotonin(2A) receptor levels correlate positively with lifetime MDMA use and do not decrease with abstinence. These results suggest that MDMA use produces chronic serotonin neurotoxicity in humans. Given the broad role of serotonin in human brain function, the possibility for therapeutic MDMA use, and the widespread recreational popularity of this drug, these results have critical public health implications.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"2245","Psilocybin induces aberrant prediction error processing for tactile mismatch responses.^\nBackground: The skin as the body's largest organ is our first contact point with the environment encoding information of many different sources as well as providing a sense of boundaries and the Self/Non‐Self discrimination – thus forming a backdrop of all perceptual experiences [1]. Predictive codes integrating bodily states and sensory inputs may give rise to self‐awareness and a sense of agency. Distortions in these processes have been linked to psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenic delusions [2]. However, the relationship between altered tactile prediction error (PE) processing and distorted self‐experience and its underlying neuropharmacology have never been empirically studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the preferential 5‐HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self‐experience, on the processing of tactile mismatch responses by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: In this cross‐over, double‐blind, within‐subject, randomized and placebo‐controlled study, fifteen healthy participants (8 males, and 7 females, aged between 20–40 years) received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight p. o. oral administration of the 5‐HT2A/1A agonist Psi. Participants completed a roving oddball task while undergoing fMRI 85 minutes after Psi/Pla administration during peak of subjective Psi effects. To induce tactile mismatch responses, trains of stimuli switched randomly between high (double pulse) and low (single pulse) intensity after a variable number of 3 to 7 repetitions, generating an unpredictable sequence. The first stimulus of each train was modelled as the “Deviant (D)"" and the third repetition of each train as “Standard"" (S). All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using a MR‐safe electrode and a constant current stimulator (Digitimer, DS7AH). The fMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in the SPM12 software package. The dependent variables were the fMRI BOLD contrasts D > S. Subjective effects were measured using the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). 5D‐ASC scores were analyzed by using a repeated‐measures ANOVA design with treatment condition (Pla and Psi) and scale as within‐subject factors. Results: In response to unpredicted stimuli significant decreases in brain activity after Psi administration were detected for the D > S contrast in areas previously implicated in body awareness and tactile deviancy processing: thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, midcingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Further, Psi produced robust perceptual alterations of bodily awareness and self‐experience assessed with the rating scale 5D‐ASC. Conclusion: This study shows that Psi alters the integration of tactile stimuli through aberrant PE signalling, potentially the underlying mechanism of Psi‐induced alterations of self and body‐experience. Furthermore, it points to the important role of the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes in the processes of self‐experience. This finding may be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders compromised by distorted self‐experience.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

"3149","Adjunctive music improves the tolerability of intravenous ketamine for bipolar depression.^\nIntravenous ketamine is an effective treatment of bipolar depression. One of its most important side-effects is a transient altered state of consciousness commonly referred to as dissociation. These states can be anxiety-provoking, distressing and even treatment-limiting, warranting research into mitigation strategies. In this article, we present two cases that demonstrate the potential of adjunctive music to diminish the distress associated with ketamine-induced dissociation—though not necessarily its degree—in bipolar 1 disorder. Both patients suffering from severe depression underwent their first ketamine infusion without music and opted for music with subsequent infusions. They reported that music significantly improved the tolerance of their dissociative symptoms, thereby reducing distress and facilitating subsequent treatments. Both patients achieved remission from their highly treatment-resistant depressive episodes following six ketamine infusions. This is the first report of music’s benefits on ketamine for bipolar 1 depression, though there is precedence in the scientific literature on ‘psychedelics’ where the use of music in combination with medication-induced altered states has been studied. The principles regarding music selection that have resulted from this paradigm may be applicable to the use of ketamine in unipolar and bipolar depression. The optimal use of music with ketamine warrants further research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"

We sought to extend these findings by investigating the extent to which ecstasy/polydrug users manifest executive deficits in everyday life. Methods:: Forty-two current ecstasy/polydrug users, 18 previous (abstinent for at least 6 months) ecstasy/polydrug users, and 50 non-users of ecstasy (including both non-users of any illicit drug and some cannabis-only users) completed the self-report Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function-Adult Version (BRIEF-A) measure.

Previous ecstasy/polydrug users did not differ significantly from non-users. In regression analyses, although the current frequency of ecstasy use accounted for statistically significant unique variance on 3 of the 9 BRIEF-A subscales, daily cigarette consumption was the main predictor in 6 of the subscales. Conclusions:: Current ecstasy/polydrug users report more executive dysfunction than do previous users and non-users.

Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"4884","Group format psychedelic-assisted therapy interventions: Observations and impressions from the HOPE trial.^\nBackground: Psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated significant promise as a treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress associated with serious medical illness and has generally been employed on an individual basis, which presents challenges for scaling and resource availability. There are also compelling theoretical reasons to suggest that group-based formats-if utilized in a thoughtful fashion-might offer unique or enhanced therapeutic benefits for certain conditions or populations. The HOPE trial is an IRB-approved open-label feasibility and safety pilot study of psi-locybin enhanced group therapy in patients with a DSM-5 depressive disorder associated with a cancer diagnosis completed at the Huntsman Cancer Institute (HCI) in Salt Lake City, Utah (HOPE: A Pilot Study of Psilocybin Enhanced Group Psychotherapy in Patients with Cancer).

Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales. The physiological effects measured were blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Side effects were assessed during the session, and after 1 and 3 days. Haloperidol attenuated MDMA-induced positive and mania-like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects. Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA. In contrast, dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA, indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"4988","Use of ketamine and esketamine for depression: an overview of systematic reviews with meta-analyses.^\nPURPOSE: To summarize the evidence of efficacy and safety of the use of ketamine and esketamine for depression. METHODS: A literature search was performed in Medline, the Cochrane Library, LILACS, and CRD until November 2020. We included systematic reviews with meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials on the use of ketamine and esketamine in adult patients with depression. Two authors independently performed the study selection and data extraction. The AMSTAR-2 tool was used to appraise the quality of included reviews. RESULTS: A total of 118 records were identified, and 11 studies fully met the eligibility criteria. Compared to control, ketamine improved the clinical response at 40 min to 1 week and clinical remission at 80 min to 72 h, and esketamine improved both outcomes at 2 h to 4 weeks. Ketamine and esketamine also had a beneficial effect on the depression scales score and suicidality. For adverse events, oral ketamine did not show significant change compared to control, while intranasal esketamine showed difference for any events, such as dissociation, dizziness, hypoesthesia, and vertigo. Most reviews were classified as ""critically low quality,"" and none of them declared the source of funding of the primary studies and assessed the potential impact of risk of bias in primary studies. CONCLUSION: Ketamine and esketamine showed a significant antidepressant action within a few hours or days after administration; however, the long-term efficacy and safety are lacking. In addition, the methodological quality of the reviews was usually critically low, which may indicate the need for higher quality evidence in relation to the theme.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"5164","Prophylactic use of ketamine reduces postpartum depression in Chinese women undergoing cesarean section(✰).^\nThis study aimed to explore the effect of prophylactic ketamine administration on postpartum depression in Chinese woman undergoing cesarean section. This randomized controlled study included 654 Chinese women undergoing cesarean section. At 10 min after child birth, patients in the ketamine group were given 0.5 mg/kg ketamine, whereas patients in the control group received standard postpartum care. At the end of operation, all patients were armed with a patient-controlled intravenous analgesia device. The primary outcome was the prevalence of postpartum depression (PPD), as assessed by the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS), and the secondary outcomes included the safety assessment and the Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) of postoperative pain. The prevalence of postpartum blues and postpartum depression were significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group. Logistic analysis showed that ketamine administration protected against postpartum depression, and PPD-associated risk factors included stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. In addition, the antidepressive effect of prophylactic ketamine was stronger in mothers with a history of moderate stress during pregnancy, antenatal depressive symptom and antenatal suicidal ideation. Our findings suggest that ketamine functions as a prophylactic agent against PPD.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"5524","Simultaneous EEG/fMRI recorded during ketamine infusion in patients with major depressive disorder.^\nA single subanaesthetic dose of ketamine rapidly alleviates the symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD). However, few studies have investigated the acute effects of ketamine on the BOLD pharmacological magnetic resonance imaging (phMRI) response and EEG spectra. In a randomised, double-blind, active placebo-controlled crossover trial, resting-state simultaneous EEG/fMRI was collected during infusion of ketamine or active placebo (remifentanil) in 30 participants with MDD. Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale scores showed a significant antidepressant effect of ketamine compared to placebo (69% response rate). phMRI analyses showed BOLD signal increases in the anterior cingulate and medial prefrontal cortices and sensitivity of the decrease in subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC) BOLD signal to noise correction. EEG spectral analysis showed increased theta, high beta, low and high gamma power, and decreased delta, alpha, and low beta power with differing time-courses. Low beta and high gamma power time courses explained significant variance in the BOLD signal. Interestingly, the variance explained by high gamma power was significantly associated with non-response to ketamine, but significant associations were not found for other neurophysiological markers when noise correction was implemented. The results suggest that the decrease in sgACC BOLD signal is potentially noise and unrelated to ketamine's antidepressant effect, highlighting the importance of noise correction and multiple temporal regressors for phMRI analyses. The lack of effects significantly associated with antidepressant response suggests the phMRI methodology employed was unable to detect such effects, the effect sizes are relatively small, or that other processes, e.g. neural plasticity, underlie ketamine's antidepressant effect.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6027","Emotional Effects of Methylphenidate and MDMA in Healthy Subjects.^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). 5‐HT release mainly contributes to the subjective effects of MDMA whereas NE release is involved in the cardiovascular and psychostimulant effects of MDMA. DA is also likely to be involved in the rewarding and reinforcing effects of drugs of abuse. However, the functional role of DA in the subjective effects of MDMA in humans is largely unclear. To determine the role of the DA transporter (DAT) in the response to MDMA in humans the investigators test the effects of the DA and NE transporter blocker methylphenidate on the subjective effects of MDMA. The investigators use a randomized double‐blind placebo‐controlled cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. methylphenidate or placebo will be administered before MDMA or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments and plasma samples are collected for pharmacokinetics. The primary hypothesis is that methylphenidate will significantly reduce the subjective effects of MDMA.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"

"6121","A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg). Total amounts of MDMA to be administered per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 180.","[0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 0]"
"6123","Ketamine's Effect Changes the Cortical Electrophysiological Activity Related to Semantic Affective Dimension of Pain.^\nKetamine is a unique anesthetic with neural effects that are distinct from more commonly‐used γ‐aminobutyric acid agonists. Evidence suggest that analgesic effect of ketamine is primarily related to the affective than the sensorial aspects of pain interpretation. The investigators investigated whether ketamine, a noncompetitive NMDA antagonist, would modify the perceived emotional valence of pain‐related words when compared to non‐pain‐related ones in healthy volunteers. Using a single session double‐blind parallel placebo‐controlled design, 24 healthy volunteers were randomized to receive intravenous S‐ketamine (n=12) or placebo (n=12). During infusion (plasmatic target of 60 ng/ml), the effects of ketamine were recorded using EEG and oddball behavioral data was monitored. Evoked potentials (N200 and P300 components) were recorded during performance of a semantic written word oddball task containing pain‐related (targets) and non‐pain‐related words (standards). Expected results: The findings of this study can help in the understanding of neurophysiologic mechanisms involved in ketamine's effects both in psychiatric diseases as in the treatment of postoperative acute and chronic pain.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"6173","Food Effects on Bioavailability of MDMA in Healthy Volunteers.^\nThe sponsor has completed a Phase 3 study of MDMA‐assisted therapy for individuals diagnosed with severe PTSD demonstrating the safety and efficacy of this treatment. However, the effect of food intake on the absorption and bioavailability of orally administered MDMA is not yet well characterized. This phase I, open‐label, randomized sequence, multi‐dose, 2‐period crossover pharmacokinetic (PK) study assesses the effect of food on the relative bioavailability of MDMA. In addition, an increase in heart rate is anticipated following MDMA administration. Therefore, the secondary purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of food on the safety and tolerability of oral MDMA, as well as MDMA effects on ECG. Potential participants will be identified by the clinical site and invited to phone screen for the study. Following informed consent, potential study participants will undergo screening examinations to assess eligibility for inclusion in the study. Participants will be randomized to receive one of two conditions before the other: ‐ Fasted Treatments: 10 hours of fasting followed by MDMA administration with 240 mL water. ‐ Fed Treatments: A high‐fat (approximately 50 percent of total caloric content of the meal) and high‐calorie (approximately 800 to 1000 calories) meal will be consumed within 30 minutes of MDMA administration. Participants will be confined at the Clinical Research Unit (CRU) for each Dosing Session from the time of check‐in on the night before dosing until discharge 48 hours after dosing. MDMA will be administered on Day 1 following the treatment sequence to which the participant has been randomized. Concentration‐time profiles of MDMA will be determined in the time interval 0‐72 hours post‐dose, according to the expected PK profiles of MDMA and its metabolites. Participants will remain at the CRU for at least 36 hours after administration of study drug for collection of serial blood samples for PK analysis and safety monitoring. An additional outpatient visit will occur 72 hours after dosing to collect a final PK sample and perform safety assessments.","[1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]"
"7914","Effects of cannabis use on antidepressant treatment response to repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation and ketamine.^\nThe present letter presents a retrospective analysis of Veterans treated with these modalities at the VA San Diego Medical Center between 2017 and 2023 and analyzed whether cannabis moderated the antidepressant effects. We found a group difference only in age for the rTMS and ketamine groups (cannabis users were on average younger (p < 0.05)). We next examined whether cannabis use affected changes in PHQ-9 scores during ketamine treatments, revealing a main effect of treatment (F (4, 510) = 21.6, p < 0.0001), with a mean reduction of 4.4 points on the PHQ-9 (CI 2.7–6.1). There was no main effect of cannabis use (F (1, 118) = 0.58, p = 0.45) nor a significant group x time interaction (F (7, 759) = 0.36, p = 0.93). Non-cannabis users showed a 4.5 point reduction (CI 2.539–6.407) while cannabis users showed a 4.3 point reduction (CI 0.7802–7.917). Our study limitations include a modest sample, a unique population of Veterans that may not generalize, and a non-randomized uncontrolled analysis. Our study strengths include results that generalize across two treatments (ketamine and rTMS), and a naturalistic design without obvious bias. Finally, this is currently the largest data on the effects of cannabis on treatment outcomes of ketamine and rTMS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8752","Meta-Analysis: Hemodynamic Responses to Sub-anesthetic Doses of Ketamine in Patients With Psychiatric Disorders.^\nKetamine, a medication traditionally used as an anesthetic, has increasingly been recognized as an effective treatment for psychiatric disorders. At sub-anesthetic doses (defined here as <= 0.5 mg/kg), ketamine treatment has been studied in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD), obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and social anxiety disorder (SAD). Transient increases in hemodynamic activity have been reported during and after ketamine treatment, which may be desirable properties in some anesthesia settings, but are generally undesirable in psychiatric settings. While ketamine doses used in psychiatry are lower than those used in anesthesia, there are published instances of early termination of psychiatric ketamine infusions due to elevations in blood pressure and heart rate. No unifying study has been conducted to examine the impact of sub-anesthetic ketamine doses on hemodynamic parameters [systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and heart rate (HR)] in psychiatric populations and to evaluate these changes across adult age groups. Here, data from 15 articles comprising a total N = 2,252 ketamine or esketamine treatments in adult participants were used to conduct a meta-analysis of treatment-induced hemodynamic changes. Ketamine/esketamine produced modest but significant increases in the variables of interest with an average SBP increase of 12.61 mm Hg (95% CI 10.40-14.82 mm Hg, z = 11.18, p < 0.0001), average DBP increase of 8.49 mm Hg (95% CI 6.89-10.09 mmHg, z = 10.41, p < 0.0001), and average heart rate increase of 4.09 beats per minute (95% CI 0.55-7.63 BPM), z = 2.27, p = 0.0235). Stratified subgroup analysis indicated no significant differences between ketamine and esketamine effects on blood pressure. Further analysis indicated that there was no significant effect of age on ketamine-induced changes in SBP, DBP, and HR. Taken together these data show that sub-anesthetic ketamine and esketamine induce small but significant increases in hemodynamic parameters that are transient in nature in adult psychiatric populations. While these data are reassuring, it is important for each treatment case to fully explore potential cardiovascular risks prior to initiating treatment.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8810","Quitting ecstasy: An investigation of why people stop taking the drug and their subsequent mental health.^\nThe regular use of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) has been associated with depressed mood, anxiety and hostility, but it is not known whether such effects persist after people stop using the drug. Furthermore, little is known about what factors might influence the decision to quit using MDMA. The aim of the present study was to examine the reasons why ex-users had stopped using this drug and to assess their current levels of depression, anxiety, anger and aggression. Telephone interviews were conducted with people who used to take MDMA on a regular basis but who no longer used the drug. The participants comprised sixty-six ex-users who used to take MDMA regularly (at least once every 2 months over a period of at least 1 year), but who had not taken MDMA for at least 1 year (average 3 years). Participants were asked about why they had quit MDMA. They also completed questionnaires to assess trait mood. Ex-users could be divided into two groups based on their reason for quitting: (i) those who had quit for mental health reasons and (ii) those who had quit for circumstantial reasons. Approximately half of those in the mental health group scored in the range for clinical depression. In that group, current levels of depression and anxiety correlated significantly with the cumulative amount of MDMA that they had taken several years previously. These findings suggest that some users may either be more vulnerable to the adverse effects of MDMA or have pre-existing mental health problems for which they self-medicate by using ecstasy. The present study shows that some ex-users experience an impairment to mental health that persists for years after they stop using this drug.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1]"
"8910","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^\nRATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both.","[0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 0]"
"9611","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.
