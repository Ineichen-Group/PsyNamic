"447","0","Increased serotonin2 (5-HT2) receptor binding as measured by 3H-lysergic acid diethylamide (3H-LSD) in the blood platelets of depressed patients.^\n3H-Lysergic acid diethylamide (3H-LSD) binding, a putative measure of 5-HT2 receptor binding, was studied in the blood platelets of 29 depressed patients and 24 normal controls. The B(max) (maximum number of 3H-LSD binding sites) in the blood platelets of depressed patients was significantly greater than that of normal volunteers. This increase in B(max) was significantly lower in female compared to male normal controls but there was no difference between male and female depressed patients. There was also no difference in K(d) (an inverse measure of affinity of 3H-LSD binding to its sites) between normal controls and depressed patients. The correlations between B(max) of 3H-LSD binding and the B(max) of the 3H-imipramine binding site or the V(max) of 5-HT uptake sites were not significant. The role of serotonergic processes in the psychobiology of depression is discussed."
"1166","1","Ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators for depression in adults.^\nBACKGROUND: Considering the ample evidence of involvement of the glutamate system in the pathophysiology of depression, pre-clinical and clinical studies have been conducted to assess the antidepressant efficacy of glutamate inhibition, and glutamate receptor modulators in particular. This review focuses on the use of glutamate receptor modulators in unipolar depression. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effects - and review the acceptability - of ketamine and other glutamate receptor modulators in comparison to placebo (or saline placebo), other pharmacologically active agents, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in alleviating the acute symptoms of depression in people with unipolar major depressive disorder. SEARCH METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group's Specialised Register (CCDANCTR, to 9 January 2015). This register includes relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs) from: the Cochrane Library (all years), MEDLINE (1950 to date), EMBASE (1974 to date), and PsycINFO (1967 to date). We did not apply any restrictions to date, language or publication status. SELECTION CRITERIA: Double- or single-blind RCTs comparing ketamine, memantine, or other glutamate receptor modulators with placebo (or saline placebo), other active psychotropic drugs, or electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in adults with unipolar major depression. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Three review authors independently identified studies, assessed trial quality and extracted data. The primary outcomes for this review were response rate and adverse events. MAIN RESULTS: We included 25 studies (1242 participants) on ketamine (9 trials), memantine (3), AZD6765 (3), D-cycloserine (2), Org26576 (2), atomoxetine (1), CP-101,606 (1), MK-0657 (1), N-acetylcysteine (1), riluzole (1) and sarcosine (1). Twenty-one studies were placebo-controlled and the majority were two-arm studies (23 out of 25). Twenty-two studies defined an inclusion criteria specifying the severity of depression; 11 specified at least moderate depression; eight, severe depression; and the remaining three, mild-moderate depression. Nine studies recruited only treatment-resistant patients.We rated the risk of bias as low or unclear for most domains, though lack of detail regarding masking of treatment in the studies reduced our certainty in the effect for all outcomes. We rated three studies as having high risk for selective outcome reporting. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.Among all glutamate receptor modulators, only ketamine (administered intravenously) proved to be more efficacious than placebo, though the quality of evidence was limited by risk of bias and small sample sizes. There was low quality evidence that treatment with ketamine increased the likelihood of response after 24 hours (odds ratio (OR) 10.77, 95% confidence interval (CI) 2.00 to 58.00; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), 72 hours (OR 12.59, 95% CI 2.38 to 66.73; 3 RCTs, 56 participants), and one week (OR 2.58, 95% CI 1.08 to 6.16; 4 RCTs, 131 participants). The effect of ketamine was even less certain at two weeks, as data were available from only one trial (OR 0.93, 95% CI 0.31 to 2.83; 51 participants, low quality evidence). This was consistent across all efficacy outcomes. Ketamine caused more confusion and emotional blunting compared to placebo. There was insufficient evidence to determine if this increased the likelihood of leaving the study early (OR 1.90, 95% CI 0.43 to 8.47; 5 RCTs, 139 participants, low quality evidence).One RCT with 72 participants reported higher numbers of responders on ketamine than midazolam at 24 hours (OR 0.36, 95% CI 0.14 to 0.58), 72 hours (OR 0.37, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.59), and one week (OR 0.29, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.49). However, midazolam was better tolerated than ketamine in terms of blurred vision, dizziness, general malaise and nausea/vomiting at 24 hours post-infusion. The evidence contributing to these outcomes was of low quality.We found better efficacy of sarcosine over citalopram at four weeks (OR 6.93, 95% CI 1.53 to 31.38; 1 study, 40 participants), but not at two weeks (OR: 8.14, 95% CI 0.88 to 75.48); fewer participants in the sarcosine group experienced adverse events (OR 0.04, 95% CI 0.00 to 0.68; P = 0.03, 1 study, 40 participants). This was based on low quality evidence. No significant results were found for the remaining glutamate receptor modulators.In one study with 18 participants, ketamine was more effective than ECT at 24 hours (OR 28.00, 95% CI 2.07 to 379.25) and 72 hours (OR 12.25, 95% CI 1.33 to 113.06), but not at one week (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83), or two weeks (OR 3.35, 95% CI 0.12 to 93.83). No differences in terms of adverse events were found between ketamine and ECT, however the only adverse events reported were blood pressure and heart rate. This study was rated as very low quality. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: We found limited evidence for ketamine's efficacy over placebo at time points up to one week in terms of the primary outcome, response rate. The effects were less certain at two weeks post-treatment. No significant results were found for the remaining ten glutamate receptor modulators, except for sarcosine being more effective than citalopram at four weeks. In terms of adverse events, the only significant differences in favour of placebo over ketamine were in regards to confusion and emotional blunting. Despite the promising nature of these preliminary results, our confidence in the evidence was limited by risk of bias and the small number of participants. Many trials did not provide information on all the prespecified outcomes and we found no data, or very limited data, on very important issues like suicidality, cognition, quality of life, costs to healthcare services and dropouts due to lack of efficacy.All included studies administered ketamine intravenously, which can pose practical problems in clinical practice. Very few trials were included in the meta-analyses for each comparison; the majority of comparisons contained only one study. Further RCTs (with adequate blinding) are needed to explore different modes of administration of ketamine with longer follow-up, which test the comparative efficacy of ketamine and the efficacy of repeated administrations."
"1028","1","Psilocybin disrupts sensory and higher order cognitive processing but not pre-attentive cognitive processing-study on P300 and mismatch negativity in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: Disruption of auditory event-related evoked potentials (ERPs) P300 and mismatch negativity (MMN), electrophysiological markers of attentive and pre-attentive cognitive processing, is repeatedly described in psychosis and schizophrenia. Similar findings were observed in a glutamatergic model of psychosis, but the role of serotonergic 5-HT(2A) receptors in information processing is less clear. OBJECTIVES: We studied ERPs in a serotonergic model of psychosis, induced by psilocybin, a psychedelic with 5-HT(2A/C) agonistic properties, in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty subjects (10M/10F) were given 0.26 mg/kg of psilocybin orally in a placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over design. ERPs (P300, MMN) were registered during the peak of intoxication. Correlations between measured electrophysiological variables and psilocin serum levels and neuropsychological effects were also analyzed. RESULTS: Psilocybin induced robust psychedelic effects and psychotic-like symptoms, decreased P300 amplitude (p = 0.009) but did not affect the MMN. Psilocybin's disruptive effect on P300 correlated with the intensity of the psychedelic state, which was dependent on the psilocin serum levels. We also observed a decrease in N100 amplitude (p = 0.039) in the P300 paradigm and a negative correlation between P300 and MMN amplitude (p = 0.014). CONCLUSIONS: Even though pre-attentive cognition (MMN) was not affected, processing at the early perceptual level (N100) and in higher-order cognition (P300) was significantly disrupted by psilocybin. Our results have implications for the role of 5-HT(2A) receptors in altered information processing in psychosis and schizophrenia."
"8854","0","Ketamine use disorder: preclinical, clinical, and neuroimaging evidence to support proposed mechanisms of actions.^\nKetamine, a noncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist, has been exclusively used as an anesthetic in medicine and has led to new insights into the pathophysiology of neuropsychiatric disorders. Clinical studies have shown that low subanesthetic doses of ketamine produce antidepressant effects for individuals with depression. However, its use as a treatment for psychiatric disorders has been limited due to its reinforcing effects and high potential for diversion and misuse. Preclinical studies have focused on understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's antidepressant effects, but a precise mechanism had yet to be elucidated. Here we review different hypotheses for ketamine's mechanism of action including the direct inhibition and disinhibition of NMDA receptors, AMPAR activation, and heightened activation of monoaminergic systems. The proposed mechanisms are not mutually exclusive, and their combined influence may exert the observed structural and functional neural impairments. Long term use of ketamine induces brain structural, functional impairments, and neurodevelopmental effects in both rodents and humans. Its misuse has increased rapidly in the past 20 years and is one of the most common addictive drugs used in Asia. The proposed mechanisms of action and supporting neuroimaging data allow for the development of tools to identify 'biotypes' of ketamine use disorder (KUD) using machine learning approaches, which could inform intervention and treatment."
"7618","0","Ketamine: A Review for Clinicians.^\nA growing series of clinical trials and case series now suggest that ketamine-originally used as an anesthetic agent-potentially offers an exciting new treatment option for severe depression. Increasing numbers of studies show that ketamine can provide prompt relief for many depressed patients, including those with severe treatment-refractory depression. Although the effects of a single treatment are commonly short-lived, multiple infusion protocols may offer sustained relief. The uniquely rapid onset of antidepressant action raises the potential for ketamine use in a variety of clinical situations, including the prevention or shortening of hospital stays, the treatment of acute suicidal ideation, and the facilitation of medication crossovers. Ketamine, in combination with other multimodal treatment approaches, including psychotherapy, may further augment response effect and duration. Promises of efficacy have led to increasingly unbridled use to treat a variety of psychiatric disorders, with diverse approaches and treatment environments, despite inadequate data demonstrating the true clinical efficacy and safety of the various protocols or a thorough understanding of mechanisms of action. This article briefly reviews the history of ketamine's development as a potential antidepressant, current hypotheses related to its mechanisms of action, and existing evidence for its safety and efficacy with a focus on clinicians' interests."
"2758","1","MDMA decreases the effects of simulated social rejection.^\n3-4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) increases self-reported positive social feelings and decreases the ability to detect social threat in faces, but its effects on experiences of social acceptance and rejection have not been determined. We examined how an acute dose of MDMA affects subjective and autonomic responses to simulated social acceptance and rejection. We predicted that MDMA would decrease subjective responses to rejection. On an exploratory basis, we also examined the effect of MDMA on respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA), a measure of parasympathetic cardiac control often thought to index social engagement and emotional regulation. Over three sessions, healthy adult volunteers with previous MDMA experience (N=36) received capsules containing placebo, 0.75 or 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA under counter-balanced double-blind conditions. During expected peak drug effect, participants played two rounds of a virtual social simulation task called ""Cyberball"" during which they experienced acceptance in one round and rejection in the other. During the task we also obtained electrocardiograms (ECGs), from which we calculated RSA. After each round, participants answered questionnaires about their mood and self-esteem. As predicted, MDMA decreased the effect of simulated social rejection on self-reported mood and self-esteem and decreased perceived intensity of rejection, measured as the percent of ball tosses participants reported receiving. Consistent with its sympathomimetic properties, MDMA decreased RSA as compared to placebo. Our finding that MDMA decreases perceptions of rejection in simulated social situations extends previous results indicating that MDMA reduces perception of social threat in faces. Together these findings suggest a cognitive mechanism by which MDMA might produce pro-social behavior and feelings and how the drug might function as an adjunct to psychotherapy. These phenomena merit further study in non-simulated social environments."
"8480","1","Association of study characteristics with estimates of effect size in studies of ecstasy use.^\nStudies of the chronic effects of MDMA, or 'ecstasy', in humans have been largely inconsistent. We explored whether study-level characteristics are associated with the effect size estimate reported. We based our analyses on the recent systematic review by Rogers and colleagues, focusing on those meta-analyses within this report where there was a relatively large number of studies contributing to each individual meta-analysis. Linear regression was used to investigate the association between study level variables and effect size estimate, weighted by the inverse of the SE of the effect size estimate, with cluster correction for studies which contributed multiple estimates. This indicated an association between effect size estimate and both user group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting former users compared with those recruiting current users, and control group, with smaller estimates among studies recruiting polydrug user controls compared with those recruiting drug-naïve controls. In addition, increasing year of publication was associated with reduced effect size estimate, and there was a trend level association with prevalence of ecstasy use, reflecting smaller estimates among studies conducted in countries with higher prevalence of ecstasy use. Our data suggest a number of study-level characteristics which appear to influence individual study effect size estimates. These should be considered when designing future studies, and also when interpreting the ecstasy literature as a whole."
"5274","1","A randomized controlled trial of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and fear extinction retention in healthy adults.^\nBACKGROUND: Fear conditioning and extinction are well-characterized cross-species models of fear-related posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, and recent animal data suggest that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) enhances fear extinction retention. AIMS: This study investigated the effect of MDMA on fear learning, extinction training, and retention in healthy humans. METHODS: The study involved a randomized placebo-controlled, two-group, parallel design trial in a sample of healthy adults, age 21-55 recruited from a major metropolitan area. The experimental paradigm included a fear acquisition session followed by an extinction training session 24 hours later, and 2 hours after study drug administration. Fear extinction retention was measured 48 hours after extinction training. Participants (N = 34; 70.6% male and 29.4% female) were randomly assigned in 1:1 ratio to 100 mg MDMA or placebo. All randomized participants completed the trial and were included in primary analyses. Safety was monitored via adverse events and vital signs. MDMA was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events. RESULTS: Results indicated a significant main effect of session between extinction training and retention with no significant group differences. Significantly more participants in the MDMA group retained extinction learning compared to the placebo group (χ(2) = 7.29, p = 0.007). CONCLUSION: Although we did not observe the hypothesized facilitation of extinction retention, the findings from this initial human trial provide compelling rationale to continue to explore the potential for MDMA to impact extinction retention.Clinical Trials Registry Name and Identifier: Evaluation of MDMA on Startle Response (NCT0318176) https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03181763?term = MDMA&draw = 2&rank = 9."
"6810","0","Acute effects of Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on resting state connectivity networks and impact of COMT genotype: A multi-site pharmacological fMRI study.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis produces various acute psychotropic effects, with marked individual differences. Cannabis use is a risk factor for developing psychotic disorders. The main component responsible for these effects is Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). Here we investigated the neural basis of acute THC effects and its modulation by catechol-methyl-transferase (COMT) Val158Met genotype. METHODS: Resting state functional MRI data of healthy occasional cannabis users were combined and re-analyzed from three double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject pharmacological functional magnetic resonance imaging studies (total N=87). Functional connectivity after placebo and THC was compared in three functional networks (salience, executive and default mode network) and a network implicated in psychosis (the hippocampus-midbrain-striatum network). COMT genotype modulation of subjective effects and connectivity was examined. RESULTS: THC reduced connectivity in the salience network, specifically from the right insula to both the left insula and anterior cingulate cortex. We found a trend towards decreased connectivity in the hippocampus-midbrain-striatum network after THC. COMT genotype modulated subjective effects of THC, with strongest dysphoric reactions in Met/Met individuals. In addition, reduced connectivity after THC was demonstrated in the hippocampus-midbrain-striatum network of Met/Met individuals only. CONCLUSIONS: In this large multisite study we found that THC robustly decreases connectivity in the salience network, involved in processing awareness and salient information. Connectivity changes in the hippocampus-midbrain-striatum network may reflect the acute psychotic-like effects of THC. COMT genotype modulation of THC's impact on subjective effects and functional connectivity provides further evidence for involvement of prefrontal dopamine levels in the acute effects of cannabis."
"3653","1","Gamma and delta neural oscillations and association with clinical symptoms under subanesthetic ketamine.^\nSeveral electrical neural oscillatory abnormalities have been associated with schizophrenia, although the underlying mechanisms of these oscillatory problems are unclear. Animal studies suggest that one of the key mechanisms of neural oscillations is through glutamatergic regulation; therefore, neural oscillations may provide a valuable animal-clinical interface on studying glutamatergic dysfunction in schizophrenia. To identify glutamatergic control of neural oscillation relevant to human subjects, we studied the effects of ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist that can mimic some clinical aspects of schizophrenia, on auditory-evoked neural oscillations using a paired-click paradigm. This was a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of ketamine vs saline infusion on 10 healthy subjects. Clinically, infusion of ketamine in subanesthetic dose significantly increased thought disorder, withdrawal-retardation, and dissociative symptoms. Ketamine significantly augmented high-frequency oscillations (gamma band at 40-85 Hz, p=0.006) and reduced low-frequency oscillations (delta band at 1-5 Hz, p<0.001) compared with placebo. Importantly, the combined effect of increased gamma and reduced delta frequency oscillations was significantly associated with more withdrawal-retardation symptoms experienced during ketamine administration (p=0.02). Ketamine also reduced gating of the theta-alpha (5-12 Hz) range oscillation, an effect that mimics previously described deficits in schizophrenia patients and their first-degree relatives. In conclusion, acute ketamine appeared to mimic some aspects of neural oscillatory deficits in schizophrenia, and showed an opposite effect on scalp-recorded gamma vs low-frequency oscillations. These electrical oscillatory indexes of subanesthetic ketamine can be potentially used to cross-examine glutamatergic pharmacological effects in translational animal and human studies."

"4861","0","Ecstasy and other club drugs: a review of recent epidemiologic studies.^\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review highlights the epidemiologic research on club drug use in the past year, with a focus on clinical epidemiology, social epidemiology, new methodological approaches, and alternative explanations for drug use behaviors. RECENT FINDINGS: Although 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) or ecstasy is currently classified as a type of hallucinogen and its withdrawal is not recognized in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, there is evidence for the association of withdrawal symptoms with MDMA abstinence. Findings from latent class analysis indicate that MDMA users have a significantly higher risk of dependence than lysergic acid diethylamide users. Research on sociodemographic factors associated with club drug use continues to be a main focus worldwide. New epidemiologic research methods have been developed to enable researchers to monitor real-time drug use behaviors and to conduct surveys on sensitive issues in public places. In addition to traditional behavioral models, researchers began to examine the club drug phenomenon in the context of economic environment. SUMMARY: Recent findings on MDMA use further question the current drug classification in the diagnostic systems. Despite the continuous growth in the club drug research literature, there is no study on the influence of genetic factors on club drug use. More research in this area is needed."
"8956","1","Learning, memory, and executive function in new MDMA users: A 2-year follow-up study.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is associated with changes in neurocognitive performance. Recent studies in laboratory animals have provided additional support for the neurodegeneration hypothesis. However, results from animal research need to be applied to humans with caution. Moreover, several of the studies that examine MDMA users suffer from methodological shortcomings. Therefore, a prospective cohort study was designed in order to overcome these previous methodological shortcomings and to assess the relationship between the continuing use of MDMA and cognitive performance in incipient MDMA users. It was hypothesized that, depending on the amount of MDMA taken, the continued use of MDMA over a 2-year period would lead to further decreases in cognitive performance, especially in visual paired association learning tasks. Ninety-six subjects were assessed, at the second follow-up assessment: 31 of these were non-users, 55 moderate-users, and 10 heavy-users. Separate repeated measures analyses of variance were conducted for each cognitive domain, including attention and information processing speed, episodic memory, and executive functioning. Furthermore, possible confounders including age, general intelligence, cannabis use, alcohol use, use of other concomitant substances, recent medical treatment, participation in sports, level of nutrition, sleep patterns, and subjective well-being were assessed. The Repeated measures analysis of variance (rANOVA) revealed that a marginally significant change in immediate and delayed recall test performances of visual paired associates learning had taken place within the follow-up period of 2 years. No further deterioration in continuing MDMA-users was observed in the second follow-up period. No significant differences with the other neuropsychological tests were noted. It seems that MDMA use can impair visual paired associates learning in new users. However, the groups differed in their use of concomitant use of illicit drugs. Therefore, performance differences between the groups cannot completely ascribed to the use of MDMA."

Field sobriety tests (FSTs) are a key component of the gold standard law enforcement officer-based evaluations, yet controlled studies are inconclusive regarding their efficacy in detecting whether a person is under the influence of THC. OBJECTIVE: To examine the classification accuracy of FSTs with respect to cannabis exposure and driving impairment (as determined via a driving simulation). DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled parallel randomized clinical trial was conducted from February 2017 to June 2019 at the Center for Medicinal Cannabis Research, University of California, San Diego. Participants were aged 21 to 55 years and had used cannabis in the past month. Data were analyzed from August 2021 to April 2023. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized 1:1:1 to placebo (0.02% THC), 5.9% THC cannabis, or 13.4% THC cannabis smoked ad libitum. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES: The primary end point was law enforcement officer determination of FST impairment at 4 time points after smoking. Additional measures included officer estimation as to whether participants were in the THC or placebo group as well as driving simulator data. Officers did not observe driving performance. RESULTS: The study included 184 participants (117 [63.6%] male; mean [SD] age, 30 [8.3] years) who had used cannabis a mean (SD) of 16.7 (9.8) days in the past 30 days; 121 received THC and 63, placebo. Officers classified 98 participants (81.0%) in the THC group and 31 (49.2%) in the placebo group as FST impaired (difference, 31.8 percentage points; 95% CI, 16.4-47.2 percentage points; P < .001) at 70 minutes after smoking. The THC group performed significantly worse than the placebo group on 8 of 27 individual FST components (29.6%) and all FST summary scores. However, the placebo group did not complete a median of 8 (IQR, 5-11) FST components as instructed. Of 128 participants classified as FST impaired, officers suspected 127 (99.2%) as having received THC. Driving simulator performance was significantly associated with results of select FSTs (eg, ≥2 clues on One Leg Stand was associated with impairment on the simulator: odds ratio, 3.09; 95% CI, 1.63-5.88; P < .001). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: This randomized clinical trial found that when administered by highly trained officers, FSTs differentiated between individuals receiving THC vs placebo and driving abilities were associated with results of some FSTs. However, the high rate at which the participants receiving placebo failed to adequately perform FSTs and the high frequency that poor FST performance was suspected to be due to THC-related impairment suggest that FSTs, absent other indicators, may be insufficient to denote THC-specific impairment in drivers.

The extent to which dopaminergic systems contribute to the effects of Delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) remains unclear. This study evaluated whether pretreatment with a dopamine receptor antagonist altered the effects of Delta-9-THC in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In a 2-test-day double-blind study, 28 subjects including healthy subjects (n = 17) and frequent users of cannabis (n = 11) were administered active (0.057 mg/kg) or placebo oral haloperidol in random order followed 90 and 215 min later by fixed order intravenous administration of placebo (vehicle) and active (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta-9-THC, respectively. RESULTS: Consistent with previous reports, intravenous Delta-9-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects including ""high."" Delta-9-THC also impaired verbal recall and attention. Haloperidol pretreatment did not reduce any of the behavioral effects of Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol worsened the immediate free and delayed free and cued recall deficits produced by Delta-9-THC. Haloperidol and Delta-9-THC worsened distractibility and vigilance. Neither drug impaired performance on a motor screening task, the Stockings of Cambridge task, or the delayed match to sample task. Frequent users had lower baseline plasma prolactin levels and blunted Delta-9-THC induced memory impairments. CONCLUSIONS: The deleterious effects of haloperidol pretreatment on the cognitive effects of Delta-9-THC are consistent with the preclinical literature in suggesting crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems. However, it is unlikely that DA D(2) receptor mechanisms play a major role in mediating the psychotomimetic and perceptual altering effects of Delta-9-THC. Further investigation is warranted to understand the basis of the psychotomimetic effects of Delta-9-THC and to better understand the crosstalk between DAergic and CBergic systems."
"6386","0","Evaluating the Role of Ketamine/Esketamine in the Management of Major Depressive Disorder with Suicide Risk.^\nNearly 5% of individuals in the USA had serious thoughts of suicide in 2019 and over 30% of individuals suffering with major depressive disorder reported suicidal ideation with 2 million of those reporting suicidal ideation with some level of intent. However, options to treat depressed individuals considered at imminent risk of suicide remain limited. Until the recent approval of esketamine in the treatment of patients with major depressive disorder with serious suicidal thoughts or actions, no medications had been specifically evaluated for use in this population in the acute setting. This review discusses the history and the current understanding of the role of ketamine and esketamine in depression and suicidal ideation and behavior. It covers some of the pivotal studies in this field and provides a summary of their major findings. The trials of esketamine in patients with major depressive disorder with active suicidal ideation or behavior are the first large-scale trials in patients considered at imminent risk of suicide. As such, the design of these studies is by definition novel, a fact that complicates the interpretation of the data and assessment of the true clinical meaningfulness of the findings. Despite this, the findings in toto draw a consistent picture of benefits that appears to outweigh the potential risks of the treatment. The studies also serve to highlight the complexities and limitations associated with clinical trials aiming to test the ability of novel therapeutics to reduce the burden and risks in patients with suicide ideation and behavior."
"8494","1","Party people: Personality and MDMA use of house party visitors.^\nPersonality characteristics have been linked to substance use, however research on the association between personality and MDMA use is scarce. This study examined differences on Big Five personality dimensions between a population sample of non-hard drug using Dutch adolescents and young adults (n = 265), and a sample of young people visiting house parties, including both MDMA- and non-MDMA-users (n = 541). Results showed that 71% of the party visitors indicated using MDMA. Group differences were found on conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness and neuroticism-emotional stability, but not on resourcefulness-openness to experience. Compared to the non-hard drug using National respondents, MDMA-using party visitors reported higher levels of extraversion and both MDMA and non-MDMA-using partygoers showed less conscientiousness. Non-MDMA-using partygoers reported less agreeableness and emotional stability than National Sample respondents. MDMA-users actually high on the drug at the moment of administration of the questionnaire did not differ from their non-high counterparts on any of the personality dimensions. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

"2961","0","The emerging role of psilocybin and MDMA in the treatment of mental illness.^\nINTRODUCTION: Mental illness has a chronic course of illness with a number of clinical manifestations. Affected individuals experience significant functional, emotional, cognitive, and/or behavioral impairments. The growing prevalence of mental illness has been associated with significant social and economic costs. Indeed, the economic burden of mental illness is estimated to exceed $1.8 trillion USD over the next 30 years. A significant number of individuals affected by mental illness fail to respond to first-line treatment options. Therefore, there remains an unmet need for rapidly attenuating therapeutic options for mental health disorders with minimal social and economic burden. AREAS COVERED: The paucity of novel treatment options warrants a renewed investigation of psychedelic-based psychotherapy. Herein, the authors will evaluate the therapeutic potential of traditional psychedelics, psilocybin, and MDMA, in the treatment of mental illness with a narrative review of available literature. EXPERT OPINION: Psychedelics, such as psilocybin and MDMA, offer an alternative avenue of therapy for many mental health disorders. Available evidence indicates that psychedelics may offer a single-dose, rapid effect model that have robust effects with treatment-resistant mental disorders and a unique advantage as a possible monotherapy for mental illness. Novel clinical trials that evaluate the safety, tolerability, and efficacy in clinically representative populations are warranted."
"6468","1","Antidepressant effects of a psychedelic experience in a large prospective naturalistic sample.^\nBACKGROUND: Over the last two decades, a number of studies have highlighted the potential of psychedelic therapy. However, questions remain to what extend these results translate to naturalistic samples, and how contextual factors and the acute psychedelic experience relate to improvements in affective symptoms following psychedelic experiences outside labs/clinics. The present study sought to address this knowledge gap. AIM: Here, we aimed to investigate changes in anxiety and depression scores before versus after psychedelic experiences in naturalistic contexts, and how various pharmacological, extrapharmacological and experience factors related to outcomes. METHOD: Individuals who planned to undergo a psychedelic experience were enrolled in this online survey study. Depressive symptoms were assessed at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks post-psychedelic experience, with self-rated Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS-SR-16) as the primary outcome. To facilitate clinical translation, only participants with depressive symptoms at baseline were included. Sample sizes for the four time points were N = 302, N = 182, N = 155 and N = 109, respectively. RESULTS: Relative to baseline, reductions in depressive symptoms were observed at 2 and 4 weeks. A medicinal motive, previous psychedelic use, drug dose and the type of acute psychedelic experience (i.e. specifically, having an emotional breakthrough) were all significantly associated with changes in self-rated QIDS-SR-16. CONCLUSION: These results lend support to therapeutic potential of psychedelics and highlight the influence of pharmacological and non-pharmacological factors in determining response. Mindful of a potential sample and attrition bias, further controlled and observational longitudinal studies are needed to test the replicability of these findings."

Given its adverse effects, the growing abuse of MDMA worldwide, and the need for forensic chemistry methods that minimize environmental issues, here we report a green approach for quantitative MDMA analysis in ecstasy tablets based on phenyl reversed-phase liquid-chromatography coupled to a diode-array detector. Water with 0.1% formic acid (pH adjusted to 5.00 with ammonium hydroxide) and ethanol (85:15, v/v) was employed as the mobile phase. The method showed good analytical performance in terms of linearity (0.0031–0.1 mg mL−1, R 2 = 0.9998), precision (1.26–7.79%), accuracy (93.5–107.7%), and recovery (96.6–100.6%). The limits of detection and quantification were 0.0007 and 0.0031 mg mL−1, respectively. The MDMA purity ranged from 14.7% to 35.1% (m/m). Additionally, greenness assessment using an eco-scale metric provided a score. The results indicated that the simultaneous use of ethanol and phenyl-bonded phase provides high selectivity and is suitable and reliable for routine analysis of seized ecstasy samples, constituting a powerful alternative to expensive mass spectrometer-based liquid chromatography and common reversed-phase columns."

Engagement in trauma-focused psychotherapy is difficult for some patients with PTSD, especially those with extreme affect dysregulation associated with recall of traumatic memories. In recent years there have been a number of neuroscientific and clinical studies examining the potential role for adjunctive drug-assisted psychotherapy using 3,4,-methylenedioxmethamphetamine (MDMA) as a treatment for PTSD. re-visiting of a novel approach to trauma-focused psychotherapy with Used just two or three times, under careful medical supervision and specialised psychotherapy support MDMA appears to facilitate the recall of traumatic memories without the user feeling overwhelmed by the negative affect that usually accompanies such memories. This therapeutic approach began in the 1980s and was subsequently shelved in the midst of public health concerns surrounding the recreational use of the drug ecstasy. When pharmaceutical grade MDMA is used in a clinical setting it does not share the same risk profiles as ecstasy. Recent phase one neurophysiological studies and phase two clinical studies are showing promise as a potential new approach to managing treatment-resistant PTSD."

This study was conducted to investigate the comparative effectiveness of repeated ketamine infusions in treating anhedonia in Chinese individuals suffering from MDD and BD. Methods: Ninety-seven individuals suffering from MDD (n = 77) or BD (n = 20) were treated with six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered over 40 min. Anhedonia was measured through the Montgomery–Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). The antianhedonic response and remission were defined as ≥ 50% and ≥ 75% reduction in MADRS anhedonia subscale score one day after the sixth infusion, respectively. Results: Anti-anhedonic response and remission rates after the sixth ketamine infusion were 48.5% (95% confidence interval = 38.3%–58.6%) and 30.9% (95% confidence interval = 21.6%–40.3%), respectively. When compared to baseline, a significant reduction in the MADRS anhedonia subscale score was observed at 4 h after the first infusion and was maintained with repeated infusions at any time point (all Ps < 0.05). The anti-anhedonic effect of ketamine did not differ between the MDD and BD groups. Conclusion: This preliminary study found that repeated ketamine infusions appeared to be effective at rapidly ameliorating anhedonia, with similar efficacy in MDD and BD.

"7243","1","Psychedelics and psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy.^\nObjective: The authors provide an evidenced-based summary of the literature on the clinical application of psychedelic drugs in psychiatric disorders. Methods: Searches of PubMed and PsycINFO via Ovid were conducted for articles in English, in peer-reviewed journals, reporting on “psilocybin,” “lysergic acid diethylamide,” “LSD,” “ayahuasca,” “3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine,” and “MDMA,” in human subjects, published between 2007 and July 1, 2019. A total of 1,603 articles were identified and screened. Articles that did not contain the terms “clinical trial,” “therapy,” or “imaging” in the title or abstract were filtered out. The 161 remaining articles were reviewed by two or more authors. The authors identified 14 articles reporting on well-designed clinical trials investigating the efficacy of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and ayahuasca for the treatment of mood and anxiety disorders, trauma and stress-related disorders, and substance-related and addictive disorders as well as in end-of-life care. Results: The most significant database exists for MDMA and psilocybin, which have been designated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) as “breakthrough therapies” for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and treatment-resistant depression, respectively. The research on LSD and ayahuasca is observational, but available evidence suggests that these agents may have therapeutic effects in specific psychiatric disorders. Conclusions: Randomized clinical trials support the efficacy of MDMA in the treatment of PTSD and psilocybin in the treatment of depression and cancer-related anxiety. The research to support the use of LSD and ayahuasca in the treatment of psychiatric disorders is preliminary, although promising. Overall, the database is insufficient for FDA approval of any psychedelic compound for routine clinical use in psychiatric disorders at this time, but continued research on the efficacy of psychedelics for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is warranted."
"2629","1","Test-retest reliability and cross-cultural applicability of DSM-5 adopted diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorders.^\nBackground: Despite increasing prevalence of nonmedical ketamine use globally, data on ketamine use disorders, which are classified in the DSM-5 under criteria for phencyclidine, are limited. This study assessed the reliability and applicability of DSM-based diagnostic criteria for ketamine use disorder. Methods: Participants who used ecstasy were recruited through the Tri-City Study of Club Drug Use, Abuse, and Dependence in St. Louis, Miami, and Sydney. Those who reported using ketamine (lifetime use >5 times) were included in these analyses (n = 205). Participants were interviewed using the computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drugs (CD-SAM) at baseline and 7 days later for the reliability of diagnoses and individual diagnostic criteria. Results: Overall, 29.3% met DSM-5 adopted criteria for ketamine use disorder at Time 1. Moderate to excellent test-retest reliability was observed consistently across study sites for any ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.57, Y = 0.61) and severe ketamine use disorder (κ = 0.62, Y = 0.79). Continued use of ketamine despite knowledge of physical or psychological problems was the most frequently endorsed individual criterion (59.0%), followed by reported withdrawal (30.2%) and physically hazardous use (29.8%). All individual criteria had acceptable reliability estimates (κ ≥ 0.41). Conclusions: Diagnoses of ketamine use disorder can be reliably evaluated using this fully structured diagnostic instrument's questions and algorithm. Ketamine-related withdrawal among people who use ketamine should be re-evaluated. Considering that after-effects of this dissociative anesthetic can last for many hours, it is important to explore a different timeframe for possible withdrawal effects."

After the translation process was completed, the questionnaire was administered to forty-five adult polydrug abusers who were residing in a general hospital. Subjects answered the questionnaire on four occasions, describing the feelings they usually experienced under the effects of four classes of drugs of abuse (morphine-like opioids, alcohol, stimulants and hallucinogens). The scales showed an acceptable level of internal consistency. A characteristic pattern of response was obtained for each condition. A discriminant analysis revealed that four scales PCAG (pentobarbital-chlorpromazine-alcohol group), MBG (morphine-benzedrine group), LSD (lysergic acid dyethylamide scale) and BG (benzedrine group) significantly discriminated between the conditions studied. Sixty percent of the questionnaires answered were correctly classified according to the discriminant functions constructed. The results from this study are similar to those obtained with the English ARCI, and suggest that the Spanish version of the 49-item ARCI may be an useful instrument for the evaluation of subjective effects produced by psychoactive drugs in Spanish populations."

The following is a description of a new high-pressure liquid chromatographic (HPLC) analytical method for the analysis of MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) from whole blood. Upon separation of MDMA, MDA and MDE by HPLC, quantitation is achieved by use of electrochemical detection. Retention times for MDA, MDMA, and MDE are 6.5, 9.2, and 10.3 min, respectively, allowing for a complete chromatographic run every 15 min. The sensitivity of the method is 1 ng/ml which allows for measurement of MDA, MDMA, or MDE in microsamples of whole blood. The volume of blood required is very small (200 μl); therefore, there is minimal blood loss in repeated blood sampling from small animals. Assay linearity was demonstrated from 1 ng/ml to at least 1 μg/ml. The coefficients of variation for both intra-assay and inter-assay comparisons were less than 9%. Other HPLC methods have been previously described for the analysis of amphetamine derivatives, but this new method offers greater sensitivity, rapid turn-around time and ease of use. © 1993."

Such crises, especially when suicide attempt or ideation is involved, are a major risk factor of suicide. Ketamine, a N-methyl-d-aspartate glutamate receptor antagonist, and its enantiomer esketamine rapidly reduce depressive symptoms in depressed patients with current suicidal ideation. Recently, esketamine has been approved for use in patients with depression at risk of suicide and for psychiatric emergency by major medical agencies in the United States and Europe, whereas ketamine is increasingly used off-label. However, there is currently limited guidance on why, when, and how to use these drugs in patients with depression to treat a crisis. In this review article, we provide a succinct overview of the cellular and molecular mechanisms of action of ketamine and esketamine, and of the functional brain changes following their administration. We also summarize the major clinical studies on ketamine and esketamine efficacy in patients experiencing a crisis (generally, suicidal ideation), and propose a profile of patients who can benefit most from such drugs, on the basis of neurobiological and clinical observations. Finally, we describe the administration mode, the efficacy and tolerability profiles, the side effect management, possible concomitant treatments and the issue of deprescribing."

A longitudinal study of ecstasy and other drug use among Norwegian youth.^\nEcstasy users have been described as ""ordinary people"" with ""normal lives"" in recent literature, but little empirical evidence exists to support this portrayal. One may assume, however, that such a rosy portrayal is more likely to fit individuals who consume drugs that are more commonly used (e.g., cannabis). With this in mind, we have explored characteristics of different categories of drug users by analyzing data from a general population study of young people in Norway (n = 2,761). Respondents were assessed three times over a period of seven years (mean age at time 3 = 21.6 years). Results showed that ecstasy users, cannabis users, and users of ""traditional"" hard drugs were all relatively unremarkable with respect to socio-economic characteristics. On the other hand, they all tended to have a less favorable family background than nonusers of drugs, and their rates of past and present legal substance use, mental health problems, and antisocial behavior were also much higher. Individuals who included ecstasy in their drug-taking repertoire had a somewhat more deviant profile than other drug users, indicating that their public image of being ordinary and well adjusted is highly overstated.

"6128","1","Effect of Ketamine on Laboratory-induced Stress in Healthy Subjects.^\nStress exposure is one of the greatest risk factors for psychiatric illnesses like major depressive disorder (MDD) and post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Stress resilience is the ability to experience stress without developing psychopathology. Enhancing stress resilience in at‐risk populations could potentially protect against the development of stress‐induced psychiatric disorders. Despite this, no resilience‐enhancing pharmaceuticals have been identified yet. Pre‐clinical studies showed that the administration of the glutamate N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine one week before an acute stress prevents the developing of depressive‐like behavior in animals. In this project the study team proposes a pilot study to test if this stress prophylactic effect of ketamine applies also to humans. Ketamine will be compared to an active placebo control condition, the anesthetic midazolam, in a sample of healthy volunteers. The specific aims of this project are to test the effect of ketamine administered 1‐week prior a laboratory‐induced stress (1) on the positive and negative affect as measured with the Profile of Mood States (POMS) ‐ Bipolar and (2) on the hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal axis (HPA axis), adrenaline‐noradrenaline axis (ANS axis), and self‐reports of anxiety.

Nitrous oxide produced a variety of subjective effects, including some that are characteristic of psychedelic drugs, such as happy, euphoric mood changes, changes in body awareness and image, alterations of time perception, and experiences of a dreamy, detached reverie state. The subjective effects, including those of a psychedelic nature, were very similar to the subject effects we observed in a previous study of nitrous oxide. However, euphoric mood changes were more pronounced, and adverse effects were less pronounced, in the present study, possibly due to the shorter duration of gas inhalation or the minimal tests of performance involved. Some other differences in subjective effects between the present and previous studies were identified by a discriminant analysis and seemed related to specific differences in experimental conditions. This suggests that the environment can influence which drug effects emerge, or at least their relative prominence. Clinicians should be familiar with the range of subjective effects that patients inhaling nitrous oxide may experience."

To date, there is no known treatment. Lamotrigine as sole agent was not found to be effective in a previous small double-blind, randomized crossover trial. However, evidence from open trials suggests that it may be beneficial as an add-on medication with antidepressants. Methods: We report here an extended series of 32 patients with DPD in whom lamotrigine was prescribed as an augmenting medication. Most of the patients were receiving selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Results: Fifty-six percent (n = 18) of patients had a more than or equal to 30% reduction on the Cambridge Depersonalization Scale score at follow-up. Both maximum dose of lamotrigine used and before treatment Cambridge Depersonalization Scale scores showed positive correlations with the percentage of response. Conclusions: The results of this trial suggest that a significant number of patients with DPD may respond to lamotrigine when combined with antidepressant medication. The results are sufficiently positive to prompt a larger controlled evaluation of lamotrigine as ""add-on' treatment in DPD."
"2206","0","Augmenting the Treatment of PTSD with Ketamine—a Review.^\nPurpose: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a lifetime prevalence of 6.1% in the general adult population. Clinical guidelines for the treatment of PTSD suggest the use of trauma-focused psychotherapies such as prolonged exposure (PE) and cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT). As a second-level intervention, these guidelines suggest the use of psychotropic medications, mainly selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). To date, however, studies have shown that both psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacologic treatments have limited efficacy, with remission rates around 40–70% and dropout rates of up to 50%. This paper reviews a new and emerging treatment approach of medication-augmented psychotherapy for PTSD, with an emphasis on augmenting prolonged exposure therapy (PE) with sub-anesthetic ketamine infusion. Based on animal and human research on fear extinction and memory reconsolidation, neurobiological changes that emerge following a ketamine infusion can enhance learning and thus benefit exposure-based psychotherapies for PTSD. Summary: Medication-augmented exposure-based psychotherapies represent a promising direction for the treatment of PTSD, with some positive results in small-scale studies. More studies (phase 2 and 3) should be performed to determine if this multimodal treatment approach may help mitigate PTSD symptoms in trauma-exposed individuals who do not respond to standard monotherapeutic approaches. © 2019, This is a U.S. Government work and not under copyright protection in the US; foreign copyright protection may apply."

Intranasal administration offers a non-invasive route for systemic drug delivery. We evaluated the safety and analgesic efficacy of intranasal ketamine in treating moderate-to-severe, acute postoperative pain in the molar extraction model. Methods: Intranasal ketamine (10 mg, 30 mg, and 50 mg) and placebo were evaluated in a randomised, double-blind, single-dose, parallel study in 40 patients undergoing removal of 2-4 impacted third molars. Analgesic efficacy was assessed over a 3 h period following drug administration. Safety was evaluated through adverse event reporting, vital signs, pulse oximetry, nasal assessments, and a standard dissociative side effects questionnaire. Results: Ketamine delivered intranasally was well tolerated. Statistically significant analgesia, superior to placebo, was observed with the highest dose tested, 50 mg, over a 3 h period. Rapid onset of analgesia was reported (<10 min), and meaningful pain relief was achieved within 15 min of the 50 mg dose. The majority of adverse events were mild/weak and transient. No untoward effects were observed on vital signs, pulse oximetry, and nasal examination. At the doses tested, no significant dissociative effects were evident using the Side Effects Rating Scale for Dissociative Anaesthetics.

In order to better understand initiation into methamphetamine use among gay and bisexual men, qualitative analyses were performed on a sample of young gay and bisexual men (ages 18-29) in New York City. Participants were recruited as part of a larger study which used time-space sampling to enroll club-going young adults who indicated recent club drug (ecstasy, ketamine, GHB, methamphetamine, cocaine, and/or LSD) use. The data for this paper are derived from the qualitative interviews of 54 gay and bisexual male methamphetamine users. At initiation (1) methamphetamine was used in a social, non-sexual setting for a majority of the participants; (2) participants expressed limited knowledge of methamphetamine; and (3) many participants used cocaine as a basis for comparison when describing various effects of the drug. The understanding that at initiation methamphetamine was not solely used as a sexual enhancement for members of this community may enable health workers to more accurately target potential users when putting forth intervention efforts. Future research should aim to gain a better understanding into the role that methamphetamine plays in non-sexual contexts, particularly among gay and bisexual men who may not be part of the club ""scene."" The relationship between attitudes towards methamphetamine and other drugs, particularly cocaine, among gay and bisexual men should be explored. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"1485","0","Adding ketamine in a multimodal patient-controlled epidural regimen reduces postoperative pain and analgesic consumption.^\nWe designed this double-blind study to evaluate the effect of adding small-dose ketamine in a multimodal regimen of postoperative patient-controlled epidural analgesia (PCEA). Ninety-one patients, ASA physical status I-III, undergoing major surgery, received a standardized general anesthesia and epidural catheterization in an appropriate intervertebral space after surgery. A PCEA device was programmed to deliver a regimen of morphine 0.02 mg/mL, bupivacaine 0.8 mg/mL, and epinephrine 4 microg/mL, with the addition of ketamine 0.4 mg/mL (ketamine, n = 45) or without (control, n = 46). The mean visual analog pain scale (VAS) scores during cough or movement for the first 3 days after surgery were higher in the control group than in the ketamine group (P < 0.05), whereas the mean VAS score at rest for the first 2 days were higher in the control group than in the ketamine group (P < 0.05). Furthermore, patients in the control group consumed more multimodal analgesics than patients in the ketamine group for the first 2 days (P < 0.05). The sedation scores and the incidence of side effects (pruritus, nausea, emesis, sleep deprivation, motor block, and respiration depression) were similar between the two groups. We conclude that adding ketamine 0.4 mg/mL in a multimodal PCEA regimen provides better postoperative pain relief and decreases consumption of analgesics. IMPLICATIONS: Many studies have evaluated one or a combination of two analgesics for postoperative pain control, but few have examined a multimodal approach using three or four different epidural analgesics. This study demonstrates an additive analgesic effect when ketamine is added to a multimodal analgesic treatment."
"5154","1","Microdosing psilocybin for chronic pain: a case series.^\nPsychedelic serotonergic agonists such as psilocybin have recently been shown to produce sustained benefit in refractory depression, end of life anxiety, and addiction when administered in hallucinogenic doses and coupled with psychotherapy. Although it has been suggested that similar high-dose protocols may help chronic pain conditions, there are few published clinical trials of psychedelics for pain. The use of these agents in subpsychedelic doses for chronic pain management has received even less attention. This case series details the experiences of 3 individuals who have used low-dose psilocybin to manage chronic neuropathic pain. Although the nature and etiology of each patient's pain vary, they share a common experience, including inefficacy of current therapeutics and decreased quality of life. Through self-administration of psilocybin, these patients have achieved robust pain relief with decreased reliance on traditional analgesic medications. Despite varying preparations and uncertain potencies, the analgesic effects for all 3 patients occurred at doses without a psychedelic experience and with minimal cognitive or somatic adverse effects. Furthermore, the efficacy of pain relief and, in some cases, the duration of the effect were magnified when coupled with functional exercise. In addition, in 1 case, repeated dosing seemed to produce increased relief, suggesting a possible long-term plasticity-mediated effect. These commonalities highlight psilocybin's therapeutic potential in the treatment of chronic pain that warrants further investigation."
"710","1","The effect of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) on whole-brain functional and effective connectivity.^\nPsychedelics have emerged as promising candidate treatments for various psychiatric conditions, and given their clinical potential, there is a need to identify biomarkers that underlie their effects. Here, we investigate the neural mechanisms of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) using regression dynamic causal modelling (rDCM), a novel technique that assesses whole-brain effective connectivity (EC) during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). We modelled data from two randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over trials, in which 45 participants were administered 100 μg LSD and placebo in two resting-state fMRI sessions. We compared EC against whole-brain functional connectivity (FC) using classical statistics and machine learning methods. Multivariate analyses of EC parameters revealed predominantly stronger interregional connectivity and reduced self-inhibition under LSD compared to placebo, with the notable exception of weakened interregional connectivity and increased self-inhibition in occipital brain regions as well as subcortical regions. Together, these findings suggests that LSD perturbs the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain. Notably, whole-brain EC did not only provide additional mechanistic insight into the effects of LSD on the Excitation/Inhibition balance of the brain, but EC also correlated with global subjective effects of LSD and discriminated experimental conditions in a machine learning-based analysis with high accuracy (91.11%), highlighting the potential of using whole-brain EC to decode or predict subjective effects of LSD in the future."
"5568","1","Effectiveness and Safety of Ketamine for Unipolar Depression: a Systematic Review.^\nMajor Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a common psychiatric disorder with major implications for healthcare system and socioeconomic burden. For chronic and treatment-resistant depression, Ketamine has emerged as a possible treatment option. This systematic review explores the evidence for the effectiveness and tolerability of Ketamine in patients with MDD. This systematic review was conducted following the guidelines of Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) checklist. Eight electronic databases were searched by using search terms: (ketamine) AND (trial OR RCT OR clinical-trial) AND (depressive OR depression OR ""depressive-disorder""). After a rigorous screening process against the predetermined eligibility criteria, 35 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were included. Quality assessment of included studies was done by using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for RCTs. Thirty-five RCTs are included in this review article with majority of studies from United States, Iran, and China. Intravenous (IV) Ketamine was effective in 70% (21/30) of the included studies whereas oral and Intranasal (IN) Ketamine were effective in two and three studies, respectively. The majority of studies (6/8) using Ketamine as anesthetic agent during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) failed to show an improvement compared to the participants receiving ECT and placebo. The most common reported side effects were nausea, vomiting, dizziness, diplopia, drowsiness, dysphoria, hallucinations, and confusion. Ketamine is an effective treatment option for patients with MDD with undesirable effects when administered via oral, IV and IN routes. Ketamine agumentation of ECT requires further exploration in well-designed studies with adequate sample size. The short-lived antidepressant effect of Ketamine is a potential limitation, therefore, further studies administering multiple infusions for acute treatment and maintenance are necessary."
"2556","1","Low-dose ketamine for treatment resistant depression in an academic clinical practice setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies demonstrating a rapid, robust improvement in treatment resistant depression (TRD) following a single sub-anesthetic infusion of ketamine have generated much excitement. However, these studies are limited in their generalizability to the broader TRD population due to their subject exclusion criteria which typically limit psychiatric comorbidity, concurrent medication, and level of suicide risk. This paper describes the safety and efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a naturalistic TRD patient sample participating in a real-world TRD treatment program within a major university health system. METHODS: The effects of a sub-anesthetic dose (0.5mg/kg) of ketamine infused IV over forty minutes on TRD patients participating in a treatment program at the University of California, San Diego was investigated by retrospectively analyzing the medical charts of 41 adult TRD patients with a diagnosis of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) or Bipolar Disorder (BD). RESULTS: Subjects were aged 48.6, 78% white, 36.6% female, and 82.9% had MDD. Significant psychiatric comorbidity existed in 73%. Average pre-infusion BDI score was 32.6 ± 8.4 (S.D) and dropped to 16.8 ± 3.1 at 24-h post-infusion (p < 0.001). The 24-h response (≥ 50% reduction from pre-infusion) and remission (BDI <13) rates were 53.7% and 41.5%, respectively. Three quarters of responders maintained responder status at 7-days. Ketamine infusions were well tolerated with occasional nausea or anxiety and mild hemodynamic effects during the infusion. LIMITATIONS: Retrospective nature of this study, lack of control group and use of self-report depression ratings scales. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first published study of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions in a real-world TRD population. The results suggest that this treatment is effective and well tolerated in this population."
"4787","1","Psychiatric Outcomes of Patients With Severe Agitation Following Administration of Prehospital Ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is an emerging drug used in the management of undifferentiated, severe agitation in the prehospital setting. However, prior work has indicated that ketamine may exacerbate psychotic symptoms in patients with schizophrenia. The objective of this study was to describe psychiatric outcomes in patients who receive prehospital ketamine for severe agitation. METHODS: This is a retrospective cohort study, conducted at two tertiary academic medical centers, utilizing chart review of patients requiring prehospital sedation for severe agitation from January 1, 2014, to June 30, 2016. Patients received either intramuscular (IM) versus intravenous (IV) ketamine or IM versus IV benzodiazepine. The primary outcome was psychiatric inpatient admission with secondary outcomes including ED psychiatric evaluation and nonpsychiatric inpatient admission. Generalized estimating equations and Fisher's exact tests were used to compare cohorts. RESULTS: During the study period, 141 patient encounters met inclusion with 59 (42%) receiving prehospital ketamine. There were no statistically significant differences between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts for psychiatric inpatient admission (6.8% vs. 2.4%, difference = 4.3%, 95% CI = -2% to 12%, p = 0.23) or ED psychiatric evaluation (8.6% vs. 15%, difference = -6.8%, 95% CI = -18% to 5%, p = 0.23). Patients with schizophrenia who received ketamine did not require psychiatric inpatient admission (17% vs. 10%, difference = 6.7%, 95% CI = -46% to 79%, p = 0.63) or ED psychiatric evaluation (17% vs. 50%, difference = -33%, 95% CI = -100% to 33%, p = 0.55) significantly more than those who received benzodiazepines, although the subgroup was small (n = 16). While there was no significant difference in the nonpsychiatric admission rate between the ketamine and benzodiazepine cohorts (35% vs. 51%, p = 0.082), nonpsychiatric admissions in the benzodiazepine cohort were largely driven by intubation (63% vs. 3.8%, difference = 59%, 95% CI = 38% to 79%, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: Administration of prehospital ketamine for severe agitation was not associated with an increase in the rate of psychiatric evaluation in the emergency department or psychiatric inpatient admission when compared with benzodiazepine treatment, regardless of the patient's psychiatric history."

The goal of this review is to highlight unique clinical trial design considerations for the study of emerging treatments for OUD that address targets beyond the MOR system. In November 2019, the Analgesic, Anesthetic, and Addiction Clinical Trial Translations, Innovations, Opportunities, and Networks (ACTTION) public-private partnership with the US Food and Drug Administration sponsored a meeting to discuss the current evidence regarding potential treatments for OUD, including cannabinoids, psychedelics, sedative-hypnotics, and immunotherapeutics, such as vaccines. OBSERVATIONS: Consensus recommendations are presented regarding the most critical elements of trial design for the evaluation of novel OUD treatments, such as: (1) stage of treatment that will be targeted (eg, seeking treatment, early abstinence/detoxification, long-term recovery); (2) role of treatment (adjunctive with or independent of existing OUD treatments); (3) primary outcomes informed by patient preferences that assess opioid use (including changes in patterns of use), treatment retention, and/or global functioning and quality of life; and (4) adverse events, including the potential for opioid-related relapse or overdose, especially if the patient is not simultaneously taking maintenance MOR agonist or antagonist medications. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: Applying the recommendations provided here as well as considering input from people with lived experience in the design phase will accelerate the development, translation, and uptake of effective and safe therapeutics for individuals struggling with OUD."
"9347","1","It's a rave new world: Estimating the prevalence and perceived harm of ecstasy and other drug use among club rave attendees.^\nThe use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") appears to be increasing worldwide, with ""rave"" attendees being one high-risk population. To date, however, only one study has collected ecstasy use information from rave attendees in the United States. To address this limitation, we collected self-report drug use information from 70 adult ""club rave"" attendees within the Baltimore-Washington corridor in April and May 2002. Data collection was scheduled between 12 A.M. and 5 A.M. Participation rates were high, with 85 percent of the club rave attendees completing the interview. Eighty-six percent of the respondents reported lifetime ecstasy use, 51 percent reported 30-day use, and 30 percent reported using ecstasy within the two days preceding the interview. While past-year ecstasy users were comparable to non-users with respect to a host of demographic and drug use variables, non-ecstasy users were significantly more likely than past-year users to perceive risks associated with the regular use of alcohol and ecstasy. Not surprisingly, non-ecstasy users were significantly more likely than past-year users to perceive harmful long-term physical and psychological effects associated with ecstasy ingestion. These findings suggest that rave attendees may be an important population for ecstasy-related prevention efforts."
"13","0","In this issue-February 15th.^\nThis editorial provides a brief summary of the articles in the current issue of Biological Psychiatry. First article provides new evidence that these antidepressant effects of NMDA receptor antagonists are mediated by their ability to increase the stimulation of α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic acid (AMPA) glutamate receptors. Subanesthetic doses of the NMDA receptor antagonist, ketamine, caused both acute and sustained antidepressant-like effects in mice. Another article used a mouse model that increased the activity of a stress response system by increasing the expression of corticotrophin releasing factor (CRF) or by administering corticosterone. The authors pooled the results of 34 double-blind randomized controlled trials that compared a single SNRI, venlafaxine, to other SSRIs. They report a 5.9% advantage in remission rates for venlafaxine. They also report that the typical doctor would need to treat 17 patients to have a single patient benefit from being treated with venlafaxine rather than an SSRI. Thus, in the typical clinical practice this difference constitutes a barely detectable benefit, but this difference could be meaningful across the large population of depressed patients in the United States.

"6137","1","Pilot Trial of Visual Healing® in Psilocybin-assisted Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nThe objective of the study is to test a strategy for optimizing Set and Setting for psilocybin‐assisted therapy of alcohol use disorder. Psilocybin shows promise in early trials for alcohol use disorder, but initial results suggest that patients with alcohol use disorder may be less likely to achieve a mystical experience with standard doses of psilocybin. Optimizing Set and Setting for the psilocybin experience may improve outcomes without requiring higher drug doses. The current study will complete a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing Set and Setting (N=10) versus standard Set and Setting procedures (N=10) in participants with alcohol use disorder undergoing open‐label psilocybin 25 mg therapy. In the Visual Healing condition, participants will view nature‐themed video programs during the Prep session and during the Ascent phase of the psilocybin experience. Anecdotal reports and reviews suggest that viewing Visual Healing creates a tranquil and calming environment that fosters a stronger connection between the viewer and nature. Psilocybin increases the users feeling of connection to nature and having an intention to connect with nature during the psychedelic session is associated with better outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy in initial studies. Reducing pre‐dosing anxiety/apprehension and enhancing connections to nature with Visual Healing may improve outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy without the need for higher psilocybin doses."
"5977","0","Marijuana use is associated with behavioral approach and depressive symptoms in adolescents and emerging adults.^\nBackground Repeated CB1 binding due to THC results in downregulation of the endocannabinoid system in cortex and limbic regions, perhaps disrupting frontolimbic functioning. This is particularly a concern in young adults who are still undergoing neurodevelopment in frontal and limbic regions. Such disruptions may be linked to increased depressive symptoms, anxiety symptoms, and executive dysfunction, and decreased behavioral approach. Objectives Here we examine the influence of young adult marijuana use on anxiety, depressive symptoms, behavioral approach, and executive dysfunction. The influence of alcohol and gender were also assessed. Methods 84 participants (42 MJ, 42 controls) aged 18-25 were balanced for gender (39 F). Exclusion criteria included: MRI contraindications, left handed, comorbid Axis-I disorders, major medical or neurologic disorders, prenatal issues, or prenatal alcohol/illicit drug exposure, or excessive other drug use. Participants completed the FrsBE, BIS/BAS, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (State), and BDI-II. Multiple regressions were run to predict anxiety, depressive symptoms, behavioral approach, and executive dysfunction from MJ group status, past year alcohol use, gender, and MJ∗gender interactions, controlling for cotinine and ecstasy. Results MJ group predicted increased depressive symptoms (p =.049). Decreased fun-seeking (p =.04), reward response (p =.01), and BAS total (p =.01) were predicted by MJ group. Gender predicted decreased reward responsiveness in females (p =.049) and decreased BIS in females (p =.03). Female marijuana users had increased anxiety symptoms (p =.04) and increased disinhibition (p =.04). Increased cotinine predicted increased drive (p =.046), reward responsiveness (p =.008) and BAS Total (p =.02). Apathy and Executive Dysfunction were not predicted by any measures. All results had small effect sizes Conclusions/Importance Depressive symptoms were greater in MJ users, while behavioral approach was decreased. Cotinine levels predicted increased behavioral approach. Female MJ users also had greater anxiety and disinhibition. In sum, these findings suggest sub-clinical threshold deficits related to regular marijuana use that are indicative of a need to prevent marijuana use in adolescents and young adults."
"9114","1","Basal functioning of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychological distress in recreational ecstasy polydrug users.^\nAbstract: Rationale: Ecstasy (MDMA) is a psychostimulant drug which is increasingly associated with psychobiological dysfunction. While some recent studies suggest acute changes in neuroendocrine function, less is known about long-term changes in HPA functionality in recreational users. Objectives: The current study is the first to explore the effects of ecstasy-polydrug use on psychological distress and basal functioning of the HPA axis through assessing the secretion of cortisol across the diurnal period. Method: Seventy-six participants (21 nonusers, 29 light ecstasy-polydrug users, 26 heavy ecstasy-polydrug users) completed a substance use inventory and measures of psychological distress at baseline, then two consecutive days of cortisol sampling (on awakening, 30 min post awakening, between 1400 and 1600 hours and pre bedtime). On day 2, participants also attended the laboratory to complete a 20-min multitasking stressor. Results: Both user groups exhibited significantly greater levels of anxiety and depression than nonusers. On day 1, all participants exhibited a typical cortisol profile, though light users had significantly elevated levels pre-bed. On day 2, heavy users demonstrated elevated levels upon awakening and all ecstasy-polydrug users demonstrated elevated pre-bed levels compared to non-users. Significant between group differences were also observed in afternoon cortisol levels and in overall cortisol secretion across the day. Conclusions: The increases in anxiety and depression are in line with previous observations in recreational ecstasy-polydrug users. Dysregulated diurnal cortisol may be indicative of inappropriate anticipation of forthcoming demands and hypersecretion may lead to the increased psychological and physical morbidity associated with heavy recreational use of ecstasy. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg."
"7055","1","Psilocybin Induces Time-Dependent Changes in Global Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The use of psilocybin in scientific and experimental clinical contexts has triggered renewed interest in the mechanism of action of psychedelics. However, its time-dependent systems-level neurobiology remains sparsely investigated in humans. METHODS: We conducted a double-blind, randomized, counterbalanced, crossover study comprising 23 healthy human participants who received placebo and 0.2 mg/kg of psilocybin orally on 2 different test days. Participants underwent magnetic resonance imaging at 3 time points between administration and peak effects: 20 minutes, 40 minutes, and 70 minutes after administration. Resting-state functional connectivity was quantified via a data-driven global brain connectivity method and compared with cortical gene expression maps. RESULTS: Psilocybin reduced associative, but concurrently increased sensory, brain-wide connectivity. This pattern emerged over time from administration to peak effects. Furthermore, we showed that baseline connectivity is associated with the extent of psilocybin-induced changes in functional connectivity. Lastly, psilocybin-induced changes correlated in a time-dependent manner with spatial gene expression patterns of the 5-HT(2A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 2A) and 5-HT(1A) (5-hydroxytryptamine 1A) receptors. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that the integration of functional connectivity in sensory regions and the disintegration in associative regions may underlie the psychedelic state and pinpoint the critical role of the serotonin 2A and 1A receptor systems. Furthermore, baseline connectivity may represent a predictive marker of the magnitude of changes induced by psilocybin and may therefore contribute to a personalized medicine approach within the potential framework of psychedelic treatment."

In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced study, the behavioral, cognitive, and endocrine effects of 0, 2.5, and 5 mg intravenous delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta-9-THC) were characterized in 22 healthy individuals, who had been exposed to cannabis but had never been diagnosed with a cannabis abuse disorder. Prospective safety data at 1, 3, and 6 months poststudy was also collected. Delta-9-THC (1) produced schizophrenia-like positive and negative symptoms; (2) altered perception; (3) increased anxiety; (4) produced euphoria; (5) disrupted immediate and delayed word recall, sparing recognition recall; (6) impaired performance on tests of distractibility, verbal fluency, and working memory (7) did not impair orientation; (8) increased plasma cortisol. These data indicate that Delta-9-THC produces a broad range of transient symptoms, behaviors, and cognitive deficits in healthy individuals that resemble some aspects of endogenous psychoses. These data warrant further study of whether brain cannabinoid receptor function contributes to the pathophysiology of psychotic disorders."

From a variety of pharmacological and brain stimulation open-label studies, the treatments were found to have similar response and remission rates of 30% to 70% and 20% to 50%, respectively. For randomized placebo-controlled trials, reported response and remission rates were 15% to 60% and 10% to 40%, respectively. Ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy both have response and remission rates at the higher end of these ranges, and their significant advantage is their fast action in an acute setting.

"2923","0","The Psilocybin-Telomere Hypothesis: An empirically falsifiable prediction concerning the beneficial neuropsychopharmacological effects of psilocybin on genetic aging.^\nWe introduce a novel hypothesis which states that the therapeutic utilisation of psilocybin has beneficial effects on genetic aging. Ex hypothesi, we predict a priori that controlled psilocybin interventions exert quantifiable positive impact on leucocyte telomere length (telomeres are a robust predictor of mortality and multifarious aging-related diseases). Our hypothesising follows the Popperian logic of scientific discovery, viz., bold (and refutable) conjectures form the very foundation of scientific progress. The 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' is formalised as a logically valid deductive (syllogistic) argument and we provide substantial evidence to support the underlying premises. Impetus for our theorising derives from a plurality of converging empirical sources indicating that psilocybin has persistent beneficial effects on various aspects of mental health (e.g., in the context of depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, addiction, etc.). Additional support is based on a large corpus of studies that establish reliable correlations between mental health and telomere attrition (improved mental health is generally correlated with longer telomeres). Another pertinent component of our argument is based on recent studies which demonstrate that ""meditative states of consciousness"" provide beneficial effects on genetic aging. Similarly, psilocybin can induce states of consciousness that are neurophysiologically and phenomenologically significantly congruent with meditative states. Furthermore, prior research has demonstrated that a single dose of psilocybin can occasion life-changing transformative experiences (≈ 70% of healthy volunteers rate their experience with psilocybin amongst the five personally most meaningful lifetime events, viz., ranked next to giving birth to a child or losing a loved one). We postulate that these profound psychological events leave quantifiable marks at the molecular genetic/epigenetic level. Given the ubiquitous availability and cost effectiveness of telomere length assays, we suggest that quantitative telomere analysis should be regularly included in future psilocybin studies as an adjunctive biological marker (i.e., to facilitate scientific consilience via methodological triangulation). In order to substantiate the 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' potential neuropsychopharmacological, endocrinological, and genetic mechanisms of action are discussed (e.g., HPA-axis reactivity, hippocampal neurogenesis, neurotropic growth factors such as BDNF, 5-HT(2A) receptor agonism, neuroplasticity/synaptoplasticity, brain-wide alterations in neuronal functional connectivity density, involvement of the SLC6A4 serotonin transporter gene, inter alia). The proposed research agenda is thus intrinsically highly interdisciplinary, and it has deep ramifications from a philosophy of science perspective as it connects the epistemic level (qualitative experiential phenomenology) with the ontic level (quantitative molecular genetics) of analysis. In the long term, multidisciplinary and innovative investigations of the 'psilocybin-telomere hypothesis' could contribute to the improvement of senotherapeutic psychological interventions and the identification of novel geroprotective and neuroprotective/restorative pharmaceutical targets to decelerate genetic aging and improve well-being and quality of life during the aging process."

These conditions are not easily detectable in clinical practice, due to the overlap between medical and psychiatric symptoms, as described by diagnostic manuals such as the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) and International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Moreover, it is particularly challenging to distinguish between pathological and normal reactions to such a severe illness. Depressive symptoms, even in subthreshold manifestations, have a negative impact in terms of quality of life, compliance with anticancer treatment, suicide risk and possibly the mortality rate for the cancer itself. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) on the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants in this population are few and often report conflicting results. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the efficacy, tolerability and acceptability of antidepressants for treating depressive symptoms in adults (aged 18 years or older) with cancer (any site and stage). SEARCH METHODS: We used standard, extensive Cochrane search methods. The latest search date was November 2022. SELECTION CRITERIA: We included RCTs comparing antidepressants versus placebo, or antidepressants versus other antidepressants, in adults (aged 18 years or above) with any primary diagnosis of cancer and depression (including major depressive disorder, adjustment disorder, dysthymic disorder or depressive symptoms in the absence of a formal diagnosis). DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcome was 1. efficacy as a continuous outcome. Our secondary outcomes were 2. efficacy as a dichotomous outcome, 3. Social adjustment, 4. health-related quality of life and 5. dropouts. We used GRADE to assess certainty of evidence for each outcome. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 14 studies (1364 participants), 10 of which contributed to the meta-analysis for the primary outcome. Six of these compared antidepressants and placebo, three compared two antidepressants, and one three-armed study compared two antidepressants and placebo. In this update, we included four additional studies, three of which contributed data for the primary outcome. For acute-phase treatment response (six to 12 weeks), antidepressants may reduce depressive symptoms when compared with placebo, even though the evidence is very uncertain. This was true when depressive symptoms were measured as a continuous outcome (standardised mean difference (SMD) -0.52, 95% confidence interval (CI) -0.92 to -0.12; 7 studies, 511 participants; very low-certainty evidence) and when measured as a proportion of people who had depression at the end of the study (risk ratio (RR) 0.74, 95% CI 0.57 to 0.96; 5 studies, 662 participants; very low-certainty evidence). No studies reported data on follow-up response (more than 12 weeks). In head-to-head comparisons, we retrieved data for selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) versus tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and for mirtazapine versus TCAs. There was no difference between the various classes of antidepressants (continuous outcome: SSRI versus TCA: SMD -0.08, 95% CI -0.34 to 0.18; 3 studies, 237 participants; very low-certainty evidence; mirtazapine versus TCA: SMD -4.80, 95% CI -9.70 to 0.10; 1 study, 25 participants). There was a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants versus placebo for the secondary efficacy outcomes (continuous outcome, response at one to four weeks; very low-certainty evidence). There were no differences for these outcomes when comparing two different classes of antidepressants, even though the evidence was very uncertain. In terms of dropouts due to any cause, we found no difference between antidepressants compared with placebo (RR 0.85, 95% CI 0.52 to 1.38; 9 studies, 889 participants; very low-certainty evidence), and between SSRIs and TCAs (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.53 to 1.22; 3 studies, 237 participants). We downgraded the certainty of the evidence because of the heterogeneous quality of the studies, imprecision arising from small sample sizes and wide CIs, and inconsistency due to statistical or clinical heterogeneity. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: Despite the impact of depression on people with cancer, the available studies were few and of low quality. This review found a potential beneficial effect of antidepressants against placebo in depressed participants with cancer. However, the certainty of evidence is very low and, on the basis of these results, it is difficult to draw clear implications for practice. The use of antidepressants in people with cancer should be considered on an individual basis and, considering the lack of head-to-head data, the choice of which drug to prescribe may be based on the data on antidepressant efficacy in the general population of people with major depression, also taking into account that data on people with other serious medical conditions suggest a positive safety profile for the SSRIs. Furthermore, this update shows that the usage of the newly US Food and Drug Administration-approved antidepressant esketamine in its intravenous formulation might represent a potential treatment for this specific population of people, since it can be used both as an anaesthetic and an antidepressant. However, data are too inconclusive and further studies are needed. We conclude that to better inform clinical practice, there is an urgent need for large, simple, randomised, pragmatic trials comparing commonly used antidepressants versus placebo in people with cancer who have depressive symptoms, with or without a formal diagnosis of a depressive disorder."
"3525","1","Self-Reported Illicit Drug Use Among Norwegian University and College Students. Associations With Age, Gender, and Geography.^\nBackground and Aims: Several studies have pointed to relatively high levels of illicit drug use among students in higher education compared to the general population. The aim of the present study was to provide an updated examination of self-reported illicit drug use among Norwegian University and college students. Methods: Data stem from the SHoT study (Students' Health and Well-being Study), a nationwide cross-sectional survey for higher education in Norway including Norwegian full-time students aged 18–35. Self-reported illicit drug use across a range of specified drugs comprised the outcome variables. Information on gender, age, and study location (geographical area) was also collected and used as stratification variables. The SHoT-survey from 2018 (N = 50,054) was used for the analyses of associations between demographical variables and illicit drug use, while trends in illicit drug use were estimated by comparing the 2018-results with data from the SHoT-surveys conducted in 2010 and 2014. Results: The proportion of students reporting having ever tried illicit drugs increased from 2014 to 2018, for both males (30.8 vs. 36.7%) and females (17.5 vs. 24.0%, both p < 0.001), while only minimal changes occurred between 2010 and 2014. The most commonly used illicit drugs during the past 12 months in 2018 were cannabis (15.2%), followed by MDMA (4.0%), cocaine (3.0%), and LSD/psilocybin (2.1%). Illicit drug use showed both linear increase with age, and inverted U-shaped relationships that peaked in the age span from 23 to 28 years of age. Males reported higher illicit drug use compared with females for all drugs. Proportions of illicit drug use varied across geographical areas within the country, with the highest use being reported in the Oslo area (the largest city and capital of Norway). Conclusions: The present study reports an increase from 2010 to 2018 among Norwegian University and college students in the proportion of those reporting to have tried illicit drugs. Despite varying proportions of use across type of drug, age, gender, and geographical location, the overall high levels of illicit drug use past 12 months confirm the need to address illicit drug use in this population."

(The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2002-01715-001[/rid].) Is there anatomical injury from methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)--also known as ecstasy--use? A major challenge is designing studies that can clearly answer this question. Inherent difficulties include unknown premorbid serotonin functioning; the effect of concomitant drug use (most users are polydrug users); reliability of self-reported usage; wide ranges in lifetime dose; variability in time from last dose; small group size; and difficulty in recruiting a comparable control group. With these significant limitations in mind, a brief review and synthesis of existing neuroimaging studies may aid the neuropsychiatrist in understanding the postulated effects of MDMA on the serotonin system, the potential secondary and tertiary effects mediated by vascular and other mechanisms, and possible implications for future health care demands. These reports on the effects of ecstasy demonstrate the progress being made in the study of brain functioning from an anatomical and neurochemical perspective.

"5716","1","Heavy ""ecstasy"" use is associated with increased impulsivity.^\nObjective: Methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), known to the public as ""ecstasy,"" decreases serotonin function in animals. There is also some evidence that MDMA decreases serotonin function in humans, and thereby may increase impulsivity in MDMA abusers. Methods: Sixteen current MDMA users and 20 non-drug-using controls were recruited and completed a behavioral laboratory measure of impulsivity, the IMT/DMT, and the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale, a self-report measure of impulsivity. Results: Heavy MDMA users (n = 8) were significantly more impulsive on both behavioral laboratory and self-report measures of impulsivity, compared with non-drug-using controls. MDMA users who used MDMA infrequently were not significantly more impulsive than controls. Within MDMA-using subjects in general, there was a significant positive correlation between the quantity of self-reported MDMA use and behavioral laboratory-measured impulsivity. Conclusions: Heavy MDMA users show increased impulsivity. Among MDMA users, the level of impulsivity as measured in the behavioral laboratory is positively correlated with the level of self-reported MDMA use. The increased impulsivity did not appear to be solely related to concomitant drug use. This study gives further support for the idea that heavy MDMA use leads to increased impulsivity in humans. Further research is needed on the long-term effects of MDMA in humans. Copyright © 2002 Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, Inc."

"8868","1","At ease-subjective effects of MDMA in placebo-controlled studies with healthy subjects.^\nBackground: 3,4‐Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ?ecstasy?) is widely used recreationally. However, MDMA is also being investigated as a new medication for the treatment of post‐traumatic stress disorder. This study was designed to characterize the subjective effects of MDMA in healthy volunteers. Methods: The present pooled analysis included data from nine randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, cross‐over studies in a total of 162 healthy subjects (82 females) receiving a single dose of 125 mg of MDMA. Outcome measures included the five Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness scale (5D‐ASC) administered once after the drug effect, and a series of visual analogue scales (VASs) administered repeatedly during the drug effect to assess the area under the effect‐time curve (AUEC0‐6h). Outcome values are reported as differences from placebo (Δ). Sex differences were assessed after correcting for MDMA plasma concentration. Results: MDMA significantly increased the scores of all subscales on the 5D‐ASC. However, the effects of MDMA on the 5D‐ASC were rather small (Δ5D‐ASC total score, % mean±SD] 13±11; p<.001) with most distinct effects in the subscales blissful state and experience of unity (Δrating score, %mean±SD: 37±32 and 21±26, respectively; both p<.001). MDMA acutely enhanced ratings of feelings of openness, talkative, trust, and closeness to others on the VASs (ΔAUEC0‐6h, %mean±SD: 95±136, 48±151, 118±135, and 71±123, respectively; all p<.001). Talkative ratings were more pronounced in men than women (ΔAUEC0‐6h, %mean±SD: 63±117 vs 34±178, respectively; p=.04). Conclusions: At a dose of 125 mg, MDMA displays strong empathogenic effects that may be beneficial for the therapeutic success of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy."
"5201","0","Evaluation of drug incorporation into hair segments and nails by enantiomeric analysis following controlled single MDMA intakes.^\nIncorporation rates of the enantiomers of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its metabolite 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) into hair and nails were investigated after controlled administration. Fifteen subjects without MDMA use received two doses of 125 mg of MDMA. Hair, nail scrapings, and nail clippings were collected 9-77 days after the last administration (median 20 days). Hair samples were analyzed in segments of 1- to 2-cm length. After chiral derivatization with N-(2,4-dinitro-5-fluorophenyl)-L-valinamide, MDMA and MDA diastereomers were analyzed by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry. Highest concentrations in hair segments corresponded to the time of MDMA intake. They ranged from 101 to 3200 pg/mg and 71 to 860 pg/mg for R- and S-MDMA, and from 3.2 to 116 pg/mg and 4.4 to 108 pg/mg for R- and S-MDA, respectively. MDMA and MDA concentrations in nail scrapings and clippings were significantly lower than in hair samples. There was no significant difference between enantiomeric ratios of R/S-MDMA and R/S-MDA in hair and nail samples (medians 2.2-2.4 for MDMA and 0.85-0.95 for MDA). Metabolite ratios of MDA to MDMA were in the same range in hair and nail samples (medians 0.044-0.055). Our study demonstrates that administration of two representative doses of MDMA was detected in the hair segments corresponding to the time of intake based on average hair growth rates. MDMA was detected in all nail samples regardless of time passed after intake. Comparable R/S ratios in hair and nail samples may indicate that incorporation mechanisms into both matrices are comparable."
"5408","1","ELEctroconvulsive therapy (ECT) vs. Ketamine in patients with Treatment-resistant Depression: The ELEKT-D study protocol.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is the most common mental illness and the leading cause of disability worldwide. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the most effective treatment for MDD and the gold-standard therapy for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), yet it remains underutilized due to factors such as limited availability, stigma, and concerns about cognitive side effects. Ketamine has emerged as the first rapid-acting antidepressant and shows robust short-term efficacy in clinical trials, but there are concerns about its long-term safety and efficacy. While response rates are similar between ECT and ketamine in clinical trials, these treatments have never been compared head-to-head in a sufficiently large, well-powered randomized study. Here we describe the study protocol for ELEctroconvulsive therapy (ECT) vs. Ketamine in patients with Treatment-resistant Depression (ELEKT-D), a non-inferiority, comparative effectiveness trial. Patients with TRD seeking clinical treatment are randomized (1:1) to receive ECT (thrice weekly) or intravenous ketamine (twice weekly) for 3-5 weeks. The primary outcome is the proportion of responders in each group at the end of study visit, as measured by a patient-reported outcome measure (Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report). The study is powered such that the non-inferiority margin allows for ketamine to retain 90% of the ECT treatment effect, with a projected sample size of 400 patients (200 per group). Secondary outcomes include remission rates, depression severity, cognitive functioning, quality of life, adverse events, and tolerability. The results of the ELEKT-D study will have important implications for patient choice, clinical practice, and health insurance policies."

Urine specimens were screened on a REMEDi HS drug profiling system. Drug use findings and profile data were subjected to pattern analysis. Results indicated a drug positive rate of 74%, with 39 drugs identified. Opiates and amphetamines were the major drugs of abuse, with detection rate of 40% and 38%, respectively. Drug users were found in all age categories (from 12 to 57 years old), and were predominantly male (M/F ratio > 5). Most arrests were made in residences or along roadways (92%-95% of total arrests). A large number of those arrested had quit school before completing junior high school and many had records of multiple arrests. By contrast, club drugs (MDMA/ketamine) were found in our sample group at lower rates (10% and 5%, respectively). Club drug users tended to be younger (mostly under 27 years old), better educated, and with a smaller gender gap (M/F ratio < 3.5). Club drug users were identified only in four relatively urbanized cities/counties and many arrests were for first offenses. Benzodiazepines (BZ) were found throughout the sample, with a detection rate of 18%. The profile identified for BZ users is similar to that of opiate and amphetamine users, although a higher ratio of BZ users (14%) were arrested in recreational places."

One hundred and eighty-six rave attendees (50% female) representing a wide range of ages (16 to 47 years; mean = 23.5, sd = 5.15) and levels of rave attendance experience (1 to 400 events) completed structured interviews in Montreal, Canada between November 2002 and September 2003 about their rave attendance patterns and their use of various licit and illicit substances at the most recently attended event. On average, participants reported using 2.5 different psychoactive substances (excluding tobacco) at the most recent event attended. Cannabis, alcohol, MDMA (ecstasy), amphetamine, cocaine, ketamine, and GHB were the most frequently reported substances, and details about their orders of administration, dosages, and patterns of co-administration are presented and discussed. The total lifetime number of raves attended by participants varied considerably (mean = 48.6; sd = 69.7; median = 25), and there was a positive correlation between the number events attended and number of substances used at the most recent event attended (p < 0.001). Analyses revealed that individuals reporting the use of ketamine, GHB, and/or cocaine at the most recent event had attended significantly more events than nonusers even when controlling for various demographic variables. A subset of respondents (n = 27) completed a second interview to determine the reliability of their responses. Results indicated that respondents could reliably recall details about which drugs were used, the total doses administered, as well as order of drug administration.

"1329","1","Long-term effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on the human central nervous system revealed by visual evoked potentials.^\nSeveral studies indicate long-term cognitive impairment of MDMA (ecstasy) users. In the present study we attempted to establish whether electrophysiological correlates of low-level cognitive processes present a long-term alteration, dependent on the level of use of ecstasy. We addressed this issue by investigating amplitude and latency of VEPs related to a very simple discrimination task involving sustained attention (arousal). Eight heavy-MDMA users, eight moderate-MDMA users and 18 drug-free control subjects were asked to discriminate whether the digit at the centre of the screen was 1 or 2. None of the subjects (except one) had used MDMA in the 6 months previous testing. We measured psychophysical performance and EEG, recorded in Oz and Fz during task execution. The heavy-MDMA users made significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < .05). Moreover, they presented reduced amplitude but not latency of VEPs in both Oz and Fz. The effect in Oz is present in P200 (for heavy users only, p < . 05) and in P300 components (for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p < .001, moderate users: p < .0.5). In Fz, the amplitude effect is present in N250 (for heavy users only, p < .05) and in P300 components (for both MDMA groups; heavy users: p < .05, moderate users: p < .05). The three groups do not differ in early components, reflecting low-level processing. These results provide evidence of long-term electrophysiological abnormality displayed by ecstasy users and agree with the suggestion that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause long-term altered conical activity in humans. © Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs."

"131","1","Drug assisted psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder in war veterans, using 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (commonly known as MDMA).^\nINTERVENTION: This is a two arm, randomised, multi‐dose study with an additional open label lead‐in for two participants. The open label lead‐in will involve two participants receiving two experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions of approximately eight hours duration each, using the full dose of 125mg 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) with an optional supplemental dose 2.5 hours later of 62.5mg MDMA (cumulative dose 187.5mg, administered as capsules). At the commencement of each experimental session the participant will undergo a urine drug screen and pregnancy test, a psychological assessment and then begin acclimatising to the environment. The MDMA will be administered soon afterwards, approximately 30‐60 minutes after the session begins. The two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions will be 3‐5 weeks apart and form part of a 12 session treatment over six months, which includes 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions of 90 minutes duration for preparatory, integrative and follow‐up purposes. The session sequence will be as follows. Sessions 1,2,3: Non‐drug preparatory psychotherapy. Session 4: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 5,6,7: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 8: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 9,10,11: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 12: Non‐drug follow‐up psychotherapy. The aim of the open label lead‐in is to verify therapist adherence to the psychotherapy manual prior to proceeding with Stage 1. Stage 1 is double‐blinded and will compare 125mg MDMA versus 30mg MDMA active placebo in the remaining 12 participants. The 30mg MDMA active placebo is not expected to provide therapeutic benefits and is aimed at ensuring an effective blind by producing some physiological effects. Those randomised to receive the full dose in Stage 1 will receive two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions and 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions of exactly the same duration and sequence as those in the lead‐in. Those randomised to receive the active placebo in Stage 1 will receive two drug‐assisted (active placebo) psychotherapy sessions using 30mg MDMA with an optional supplemental dose of 15mg MDMA (cumulative dose 45mg) and 10 non‐drug psychotherapy sessions. The session duration and the sequence of the 12 sessions will be exactly the same as those in the lead‐in. Stage 2 is an optional treatment for those participants (only) who received the active placebo in Stage 1. After unblinding at the end of Stage 1, eligible participants who choose to complete Stage 2 will undergo an open label full dose treatment involving two drug‐assisted psychotherapy sessions and eight non‐drug psychotherapy sessions. The session durations will be the same as for the lead‐in. The session sequence for Stage 2 is as follows. Session 1: Non‐drug preparatory psychotherapy. Session 2: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 3,4,5: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 6: Experimental drug‐assisted psychotherapy. Sessions 7,8,9: Non‐drug integrative psychotherapy. Session 10: Non‐drug follow‐up psychotherapy. All study participants will attend an additional long term follow‐up session 12 months after their final experimental drug‐assisted session.

"8971","1","Use of Lysergic Acid Diethylamide by Major Depression Status.^\nImportance: Renewed interest in the clinical potential of hallucinogens may lead people with depression to a generally more positive view of the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Therefore, past-year LSD use among people with depression may be increasing in prevalence. Objective: To assess time trends in the prevalence of past-year nonmedical LSD use by past-year major depression status and the variation in this association by sociodemographic characteristics. Design, Setting, and Participants: This survey study used pooled publicly available data from 478 492 adults aged 18 years or older who were administered the National Survey on Drug Use and Health from 2008 through 2019. Statistical analysis was conducted from December 2022 to June 2023. Main Outcome and Measures: Past-year major depression diagnoses per criteria from the DSM-IV were analyzed. Logistic regression models examined whether time trends in past-year nonmedical LSD use differed between adults with vs without past-year depression, adjusting for sociodemographic characteristics. Secondary analyses examined whether the trends in LSD use by depression status differed between sociodemographic subgroups. Results: The analytic sample included 478 492 adults, of whom 51.8% were female, 56.1% were younger than 50 years, 11.7% were Black, 15.1% were Hispanic, 65.8% were White, and 7.5% were another race. Weighted interview response rates ranged from 64.9% to 75.6% during the study time frame. From 2008 to 2019, past-year use of LSD increased significantly more among adults with major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.5%; 2019 prevalence, 1.8%; prevalence difference [PD], 1.3% [95% CI, 1.0%-1.6%]) compared with adults without major depression (2008 prevalence, 0.2%; 2019 prevalence, 0.8%; PD, 0.6% [95% CI, 0.5%-0.7%]) (difference in difference, 0.8% [95% CI, 0.5%-1.1%]). This difference was particularly pronounced among young adults aged 34 years or younger (PD among those aged 18-25 years with depression, 3.3% [95% CI, 2.5%-4.2%]; PD among those aged 26-34 years with depression, 2.7% [95% CI, 1.6%-3.8%]) and individuals with incomes less than $75 000 per year (PD among those with income <$20 000, 1.9% [95% CI, 1.3%-2.6%]; PD among those with income $20 000-$49 999, 1.5% [95% CI, 1.0%-2.1%]; PD among those with income $50 000-$74 999, 1.3% [95% CI, 0.7%-2.0%]). Conclusions and Relevance: This study suggests that, from 2008 to 2019, there was a disproportionate increase in the prevalence of past-year LSD use among US adults with past-year depression. Among those with depression, this increase was particularly strong among younger adults and those with lower household incomes. Among individuals with depression who also report LSD use, clinicians should discuss potential strategies for mitigating harm and maximizing benefits in medically unsupervised settings."

Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted for studies published until June 2021 using the OVID databases (MEDLINE, Embase, APA PsycInfo) and the clinical trial registries (ClinicalTrials.gov, ICTRP). Results In total, five relevant published articles were identified, among which four investigated N2O for depression. One single-dose randomized controlled trial (RCT) for treatment-resistant depression (TRD), one triple crossover RCT comparing 50% vs. 25% N2O for TRD, and one repeated-dose RCT for major depressive disorder (MDD) suggest that N2O has preliminary feasibility with rapid-acting effects on symptoms of depression. From the public registries, 10 relevant ongoing clinical trials were identified. They aim to explore the use of N2O for MDD, post-traumatic stress disorder, bipolar disorder, obsessive-compulsive disorder, and suicidal ideation. To date, the typical treatment protocol parameters were a single session of 50% N2O delivered for 60 min, although the concentration of 25% is also being explored. Projected enrolment numbers for ongoing trials (M = 55.0) were much higher than sample sizes for published studies (M = 13.0), suggesting that there potentially will be more large-scale RCTs published in the next few years. Conclusion Preliminary studies support the feasibility of administering N2O for depression; however, appropriate blinding is a critical challenge. Larger-scale RCTs with repeated doses of N2O and follow-up times beyond 1 month are needed to confirm the feasibility, therapeutic efficacy, and sustainability of response."
"8843","1","Psilocybin-Mediated Attenuation of Gamma Band Auditory Steady-State Responses (ASSR) Is Driven by the Intensity of Cognitive and Emotional Domains of Psychedelic Experience.^\nPsilocybin is a classical serotoninergic psychedelic that induces cognitive disruptions similar to psychosis. Gamma activity is affected in psychosis and is tightly related to cognitive processing. The 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses (ASSR) are frequently used as indicators to test the ability to generate gamma activity. Based on previous literature, we studied the impact of psilocybin on 40 Hz ASSR in healthy volunteers. The study was double blind and placebo controlled with a crossover design. A sample of 20 healthy subjects (10M/10F) received psilocybin orally 0.26 mg/kg or placebo. Participants were measured four times in total, one time before ingestion of psilocybin/placebo and one time after ingestion, during the peak of intoxication. A series of 500 ms click trains were used for stimulation. Psilocybin induced a psychedelic effect and decreased 40 Hz ASSR phase-locking index compared to placebo. The extent of the attenuation was related to Cognition and Affect on the Hallucinogen Rating Scale. The current study shows that psilocybin lowers the synchronization level and the amplitude of 40 Hz auditory steady-state responses, which yields further support for the role of gamma oscillations in cognitive processing and its disturbance."
"1482","1","Brain volume in chronic ketamine users - relationship to sub-threshold psychotic symptoms and relevance to schizophrenia.^\nRATIONALE: Ketamine may model aspects of schizophrenia arising through NMDA receptor activity deficits. Although acute ketamine can induce effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms, chronic use may be a closer model of idiopathic psychosis. OBJECTIVES: We tested the hypotheses that ketamine users had lower brain volumes, as measured using MRI, and greater sub-threshold psychotic symptoms relative to a poly-drug user control group. METHODS: Ketamine users (n = 17) and poly-drug using controls (n = 19) were included in the study. All underwent volumetric MRI imaging and measurement of sub-threshold psychotic symptoms using the Comprehensive Assessment of At-Risk Mental State (CAARMS). Freesurfer was used to analyse differences in regional brain volume, cortical surface area and thickness between ketamine users and controls. The relationship between CAARMS ratings and brain volume was also investigated in ketamine users. RESULTS: Ketamine users were found to have significantly lower grey matter volumes of the nucleus accumbens, caudate nucleus, cerebellum and total cortex (FDR p < 0.05; Cohen's d = 0.36-0.75). Within the cortex, ketamine users had significantly lower grey matter volumes within the frontal, temporal and parietal cortices (Cohen's d 0.7-1.31; FDR p < 0.05). They also had significantly higher sub-threshold psychotic symptoms (p < 0.05). Frequency of ketamine use showed an inverse correlation with cerebellar volume (p < 0.001), but there was no relationship between regional brain volumes and sub-threshold psychotic symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Chronic ketamine use may cause lower grey matter volumes as well as inducing sub-threshold psychotic symptoms, although these likely arise through distinct mechanisms."
"7057","1","The role of the serotonin 2A receptor in the fabric and modulation of personal meaning in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced states.^\nAbnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to stimuli are critical features of many psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, addiction, and mood disorders [1]. However, the neuronal substrates enabling meaningful and personally relevant experiences are largely unknown. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical hallucinogen which has high affinity at serotonin (5‐HT)‐2A/C, ‐1A/B, ‐6, and ‐7, and dopamine D2/D1 receptors (R). Animal studies suggest that LSD produces its psychedelic effects primarily via agonist action at 5‐HT2AR although D2R may also be implicated. A core feature of LSDinduced psychedelic states is an increased sense of meaning of objects [2]. Ketanserin is a selective 5‐HT2AR antagonist which may in combination with LSD and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) offer the opportunity to determine the role of the 5‐HT2AR system in personal meaning processing. In a double‐blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross‐over study we therefore assessed the neural and behavioral response to personally meaningful, neutral, and personally meaningless music using fMRI and behavioral meaningfulness ratings. Twenty‐two healthy participants received either (1) placebo + placebo (Pla condition), (2) placebo + LSD (100 μg po, LSD condition), or (3) ketanserin (40 mg po) + LSD (100 μg po, Ket+LSD condition) at three different occasions. Subjective drug effects were assessed using the Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). Behavioral data were analyzed by repeated‐measures analyses of variance with treatment (Pla, LSD, Ket+LSD) and scale (5D‐ASC scales) or music category (meaningful, neutral, meaningless) as within‐subject factors followed by Bonforroni‐corrected simple main effects analyses or paired comparisons in case of significant interactions or main effects. FMRI data were analyzed using a general linear model (GLM) as implemented in SPM12. Meaningfulness ratings were increased for meaningless and neutral music under LSD compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD (all p<0.05). Furthermore, listening to meaningless music compared to neutral and personally meaningful music was associated with increased BOLD signal in medial and lateral frontal brain areas in the LSD condition compared to both Pla and Ket+LSD conditions. (brain areas: dorsal anterior cingulate cortex, supplementary motor area, dorsomedial prefrontal cortex, ventrolateral prefrontal cortex, all p<0.05, FWE corrected). Furthermore, subjective drug effects were significantly increased after LSD administration compared to placebo on all 5D‐ASC scales (all p<0.05) except for anxiety and spiritual experience (all p>0.30). These LSDinduced effects were fully blocked by ketanserin (all p <0.05). LSD increased the attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli. This effect appears to be attributable to 5‐HT2AR stimulation, since these alterations are normalized after pretreatment with ketanserin. Furthermore, surprisingly virtually all LSD‐induced psychological effects were blocked by 5‐HT2AR antagonism, despite LSD's additional action on dopamine receptors. The current results emphasize the pivotal role of the 5‐HT2AR in the generation of personal meaning in medial and lateral frontal brains structures implicated in self‐referential processes [3]. These findings may be relevant for increasing our understanding of the biochemical underpinnings of personal meaning processing and may reveal prospective targets in the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in meaning attribution."
"4970","1","Acute psychological and physiological effects of MDMA (""Ecstasy"") after haloperidol pretreatment in healthy humans.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") releases serotonin and dopamine. The role for dopamine in mediating the effects of MDMA has not yet been examined in humans. We investigated the effect of pretreatment with the dopamine D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg i.v.) on psychological and physiological responses to MDMA (1.5 mg/kg p.o.) in 14 healthy volunteers using a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design. Subjective peak effects were rated using standardised scales. The physiological effects measured were blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Side effects were assessed during the session, and after 1 and 3 days. Haloperidol attenuated MDMA-induced positive and mania-like mood but had no reducing effect on other subjective changes or on cardiovascular effects. Results are consistent with a partial dopaminergic mediation of the euphoriant effects of MDMA. In contrast, dopamine does not seem to contribute to the physiological effects of MDMA, indicating a role for serotonin and norepinephrine."
"5641","1","A retrospective naturalistic study comparing the efficacy of ketamine and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation for treatment-resistant depression.^\nDepression is a common mental disorder that affects many people worldwide, while a significant proportion of patients remain non-responsive to antidepressant medications. Alternative treatment options such as ketamine therapy and repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) therapy are offered nowadays. This study aims to describe and compare the acute antidepressive efficacy of both, intramuscular ketamine and rTMS in depression patients seeking help in a naturalistic clinical mental health setting. The clinical records of 24 patients with treatment resistant depression were collected from the clinical base of a real life clinic. Twelve patients were treated with intramuscular ketamine, twice weekly for 8 sessions, and twelve patients were treated with 30 sessions of left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex—intermittent theta-burst stimulation (DLPFC-iTBS). Using three clinical assessments (HDRS, HAM-A, BDI-II), our data reveal that both therapies led to significant improvement in symptoms from pre- to post-treatment, as well as that the two experimental groups did not differ significantly with respect to pre- to post-depressive and anxiety symptoms, indicating that the effect of both experimental groups in our sample was equally effective. Furthermore, our results showed high remission and response rates in both groups, with no statistical differences between the patients of ketamine group and rTMS group in remission and response rates. We show a significant pre- to post-treatment reduction in depressive and anxiety symptoms, with no significant differences between the two experimental groups, indicating that the effect of both therapies was equally effective in our limited sample.

"4522","1","Evaluating global brain connectivity as an imaging marker for depression: influence of preprocessing strategies and placebo-controlled ketamine treatment.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with altered global brain connectivity (GBC), as assessed via resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI). Previous studies found that antidepressant treatment with ketamine normalized aberrant GBC changes in the prefrontal and cingulate cortices, warranting further investigations of GBC as a putative imaging marker. These results were obtained via global signal regression (GSR). This study is an independent replication of that analysis using a separate dataset. GBC was analyzed in 28 individuals with MDD and 22 healthy controls (HCs) at baseline, post-placebo, and post-ketamine. To investigate the effects of preprocessing, three distinct pipelines were used: (1) regression of white matter (WM)/cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) signals only (BASE); (2) WM/CSF + GSR (GSR); and (3) WM/CSF + physiological parameter regression (PHYSIO). Reduced GBC was observed in individuals with MDD only at baseline in the anterior and medial cingulate cortices, as well as in the prefrontal cortex only after regressing the global signal. Ketamine had no effect compared to baseline or placebo in either group in any pipeline. PHYSIO did not resemble GBC preprocessed with GSR. These results concur with several studies that used GSR to study GBC. Further investigations are warranted into disease-specific components of global fMRI signals that may drive these results and of GBCr as a potential imaging marker in MDD."
"77","1","Dose-related effects of ketamine for antidepressant-resistant symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder in veterans and active duty military: a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled multi-center clinical trial.^\nThis study tested the efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine doses to reduce symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Veterans and service members with PTSD (n = 158) who failed previous antidepressant treatment were randomized to 8 infusions administered twice weekly of intravenous placebo (n = 54), low dose (0.2 mg/kg; n = 53) or standard dose (0.5 mg/kg; n = 51) ketamine. Participants were assessed at baseline, during treatment, and for 4 weeks after their last infusion. Primary analyses used mixed effects models. The primary outcome measure was the self-report PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5), and secondary outcome measures were the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) and the Montgomery Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). There were no significant group-by-time interactions for PTSD symptoms measured by the PCL-5 or CAPS-5. The standard ketamine dose ameliorated depression measured by the MADRS significantly more than placebo. Ketamine produced dose-related dissociative and psychotomimetic effects, which returned to baseline within 2 h and were less pronounced with repeated administration. There was no evidence of differential treatment discontinuation by ketamine dose, consistent with good tolerability. This clinical trial failed to find a significant dose-related effect of ketamine on PTSD symptoms. Secondary analyses suggested that the standard dose exerted rapid antidepressant effects. Further studies are needed to determine the role of ketamine in PTSD treatment. ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02655692."

MDMA can be used in combination with other drugs such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors. A clinical trial was designed where subjects pretreated with paroxetine, one of the most potent inhibitors of both 5-hydroxytryptamine reuptake and CYP2D6 activity, were challenged with a single dose of MDMA. The aim of the study was to evaluate the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic interaction between paroxetine and MDMA in humans. A randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial was conducted in 12 healthy male subjects. Variables included physiological parameters, psychomotor performance, subjective effects, and pharmacokinetics. Subjects received 20 mg/day paroxetine (or placebo) orally for the 3 days before MDMA challenge (100 mg oral). MDMA alone produced the prototypical effects of the drug. Pretreatment with paroxetine was associated with marked decreases of both physiological and subjective effects of MDMA, despite a 30% increase in MDMA plasma concentrations. The decreases of 3-methoxy-4-hydroxymethamphetamine plasma concentrations suggest a metabolic interaction of paroxetine and MDMA. These data show that pretreatment with paroxetine significantly attenuates MDMA-related physiological and psychological effects. It seems that paroxetine could interact with MDMA at pharmacodynamic (serotonin transporter) and pharmacokinetic (CYP2D6 metabolism) levels. Marked decrease in the effects of MDMA could lead users to take higher doses of MDMA and to produce potential life-threatening toxic effects."

Anecdotal reports of recreational drug use also often include descriptions of changes in the speed of the passage of time. Despite this, little is known about how and why recreational drug use influences the passage of time. Aim: To examine retrospective self-reports of the passage of time during a previous instance of alcohol, cannabis, cocaine or MDMA use. To establish the effect of substance use frequency, substance dose, anxiety, depression and stress on the passage of time. Methods: Using an online questionnaire, passage of time judgments were collected for the current day as well as recent instances of alcohol, cocaine, marijuana or MDMA use. Measures of affect, typical substance use frequency and substance use amount were taken. Results: Time was remembered as passing signifi cantly more quickly than normal during alcohol, cocaine and MDMA use. Marijuana was associated with time passing more slowly than normal. Regression analysis revealed that drug induced distortions to the passage of time use were not predicted by drug use frequency, dose, depression, anxiety or stress. Furthermore, comparison of recreational drug users and non-users did not indicate any long-term effects of drug use on the passage of time. Conclusions: The results suggest that whilst distortions to the passage of time are a common feature of drug use, their causes are complex."
"6358","1","Two cases of delayed-onset suicidal ideation, dysphoria and anxiety after ketamine infusion in patients with obsessive-compulsive disorder and a history of major depressive disorder.^\nKetamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that is Food and Drug Administration-approved in the United States for anesthesia due to its sedative effects with low risk of severe respiratory depression. Subanesthetic dose intravenous ketamine has rapidly acting antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant unipolar and bipolar depression. We recently reported an open-label trial of ketamine in 10 subjects with treatment-refractory obsessive-compulsive disorder, seven of whom had active comorbid depression. Although ketamine had no sustained anti-obsessive effect, four of the seven subjects with comorbid depression experienced an acute antidepressant effect. However, we unexpectedly observed delayed-onset dysphoria, worsening anxiety and suicidal thinking in two of the three subjects with obsessive-compulsive disorder and extensive psychiatric comorbidity but minimal depressive symptoms at the start of infusion. The implications of these adverse neuropsychiatric effects in two patients with similar psychiatric comorbidity are discussed. We conclude that there remains insufficient data on therapeutic ketamine in the presence of comorbid psychiatric disorders to promote its off-label use in a non-research milieu."
"8248","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during smooth pursuit eye movements.^\nThe uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

"7124","1","Psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition are attenuated by ketanserin in healthy human volunteers.^\nThe serotonin-2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) has been implicated in the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and related inhibitory gating and behavioral inhibition deficits of schizophrenia patients. The hallucinogen psilocybin disrupts automatic forms of sensorimotor gating and response inhibition in humans, but it is unclear so far whether the 5-HT(2A)R or 5-HT(1A)R agonist properties of its bioactive metabolite psilocin account for these effects. Thus, we investigated whether psilocybin-induced deficits in automatic and controlled inhibition in healthy humans could be attenuated by the 5-HT(2A/2C)R antagonist ketanserin. A total of 16 healthy participants received placebo, ketanserin (40 mg p.o.), psilocybin (260 μg/kg p.o.), or psilocybin plus ketanserin in a double-blind, randomized, and counterbalanced order. Sensorimotor gating was measured by prepulse inhibition (PPI) of the acoustic startle response. The effects on psychopathological core dimensions and behavioral inhibition were assessed by the altered states of consciousness questionnaire (5D-ASC), and the Color-Word Stroop Test. Psilocybin decreased PPI at short lead intervals (30 ms), increased all 5D-ASC scores, and selectively increased errors in the interference condition of the Stroop Test. Stroop interference and Stroop effect of the response latencies were increased under psilocybin as well. Psilocybin-induced alterations were attenuated by ketanserin pretreatment, whereas ketanserin alone had no significant effects. These findings suggest that the disrupting effects of psilocybin on automatic and controlled inhibition processes are attributable to 5-HT(2A)R stimulation. Sensorimotor gating and attentional control deficits of schizophrenia patients might be due to changes within the 5-HT(2A)R system."
"1269","1","Neural correlates of the psychedelic state as determined by fMRI studies with psilocybin.^\nPsychedelic drugs have a long history of use in healing ceremonies, but despite renewed interest in their therapeutic potential, we continue to know very little about how they work in the brain. Here we used psilocybin, a classic psychedelic found in magic mushrooms, and a task-free functional MRI (fMRI) protocol designed to capture the transition from normal waking consciousness to the psychedelic state. Arterial spin labeling perfusion and blood-oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) fMRI were used to map cerebral blood flow and changes in venous oxygenation before and after intravenous infusions of placebo and psilocybin. Fifteen healthy volunteers were scanned with arterial spin labeling and a separate 15 with BOLD. As predicted, profound changes in consciousness were observed after psilocybin, but surprisingly, only decreases in cerebral blood flow and BOLD signal were seen, and these were maximal in hub regions, such as the thalamus and anterior and posterior cingulate cortex (ACC and PCC). Decreased activity in the ACC/medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) was a consistent finding and the magnitude of this decrease predicted the intensity of the subjective effects. Based on these results, a seed-based pharmaco-physiological interaction/functional connectivity analysis was performed using a medial prefrontal seed. Psilocybin caused a significant decrease in the positive coupling between the mPFC and PCC. These results strongly imply that the subjective effects of psychedelic drugs are caused by decreased activity and connectivity in the brain's key connector hubs, enabling a state of unconstrained cognition."
"579","1","Ketamine in the Treatment of Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder: A Systematic Review.^\nINTRODUCTION: First-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) includes exposure and response prevention behavioral therapy and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, particularly in combination. New and more effective treatments are needed, give that recent studies suggest that glutamatergic neurotransmission contributes to the pathophysiology of the disorder. In these circumstances, ketamine, as a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and glutamate modulator, offers alternative possibilities for OCD treatment. METHODS: This systematic review aims to investigate the effects of ketamine in OCD, following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analyses Protocols (PRISMA-P). Searches were carried out using the PubMed/MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases. RESULTS: Nine articles were included, of which three were randomized controlled trials, three case reports, two open-label trials, and one a retrospective chart review. Reported data have shown a potential for fast onset of action and good tolerability of ketamine for OCD, even though the principal studies used only single-session racemic ketamine treatments, administered intravenously, and the results have been erratic. In addition, none of the available evidence demonstrates whether racemic ketamine, S-ketamine, or R-ketamine has the best efficacy in controlling OCD symptoms, and only sparse evidence suggests that a combination of ketamine and psychotherapy could benefit patients with OCD. CONCLUSION: In order to advance clinical practice regarding the use of ketamine in treating OCD, future randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials are required. These trials need to use larger samples to explore ketamine and its enantiomers, with different methods of administration, multiple sessions, and appropriate washout periods."

The wide range of relevant but methodologically diverse tests was .rst grouped into clusters to allow an evaluation of tests that would otherwise have been excluded due to their low frequency of utilization. The following three types of tests were evaluated: (1) functional tests quantifying executive, attention, visual, motor, visuomotor and auditory functions, (2) phenomenological tests assessing personal, subjective experiences, and (3) physiological measures reflecting neurophysiological, endocrine and physiological parameters. MDMA showed robust effects on most of the phenomenological and physiological tests. Functional tests were scarce, preventing any meaningful conclusions to be drawn from their evaluation other than that these tests should be incorporated into future acute-effect studies. A striking doseñresponse relationship appeared for cardiovascular effects. At doses below 1.0 mg/kg MDMA no change was observed relative to placebo while above this dose all studies reported significant increases. Furthermore, pupil size, plasma cortisol and plasma prolactin levels proved responsive to MDMA administration. The reported subjective effects of MDMA matched the entactogenic profile. Although interest in the action of MDMA is considerable, the existing knowledge about the cognitive effects of MDMA in humans is still rather limited and further research into the drug's effects is recommended, also in view of potential therapeutic uses of the drug."

METHODS: Participants included 23 medication-free major depressive disorder subjects (12 F/11 M, 20-55 years) currently experiencing a major depressive episode. Subjects had scored ≥20 on the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale. Following a single-blind, placebo lead-in, participants were randomized to receive 2 counterbalanced blocks of 3 i.v. infusions of scopolamine (4 μg/kg) and placebo in a double-blind manner. The primary and secondary outcomes were the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, respectively. Magnetoencephalography and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor concentrations were obtained prior to and after each treatment phase. RESULTS: As assessed by both the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale, scopolamine had no significant antidepressant or anxiolytic effects relative to placebo. No significant drug vs placebo effects were seen in magnetoencephalography gamma power or brain-derived neurotrophic factor plasma concentrations, and brain-derived neurotrophic factor changes did not correlate with change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale score in response to scopolamine. CONCLUSIONS: These results do not support the efficacy of scopolamine for more severe or refractory forms of depression. No pre- to post-infusion changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor were detected, and magnetoencephalography gamma power changed only in the placebo lead-in, suggesting that these biomarker measures were not affected by scopolamine in this cohort. While difficult to interpret given the lack of antidepressant response, the findings suggest that the neurobiological effects of ketamine and scopolamine are at least partly distinct."

However, various dosing regimens when used alone or in combination have variable efficacy and side effect profile. The aim of our study was to investigate and compare the efficacy of oral midazolam alone with a low-dose combination of oral midazolam and ketamine. METHODS: We performed a prospective randomized double-blind study in 100 children who were randomly allocated into two groups. Group M received 0.5 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam and group MK received 0.25 mg.kg(-1) oral midazolam with 2.5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine. The preoperative sedation score, ease of parental separation and ease of mask acceptance were evaluated on a 4-point scale. The time to recovery from anesthesia and to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score was also noted. RESULTS: Uniform and acceptable sedation scores were seen in both the groups (group M 95.9%; group MK 97.96%), without any serious side effects. However, the combination offered significantly more children in an awake, calm and quiet state, who were easily separated from their parents (73.46% in MK vs 41% in group M). The induction scores were comparable between the groups. The recovery room characteristics and time to achieve satisfactory Aldrete score were also comparable between the two groups. CONCLUSIONS: Oral midazolam alone and a combination of midazolam with ketamine provide equally effective anxiolysis and separation characteristics. However, the combination provided more children in an awake, calm and quiet state who could be separated easily from parents."
"5121","1","Family history of alcohol dependence and antidepressant response to an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist in bipolar depression.^\nOBJECTIVES: Both ketamine and ethanol are N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists. Ketamine has rapid antidepressant properties in major depressive disorder (MDD) as well as bipolar depression. In individuals with MDD, a positive family history of alcohol dependence (FHP) was associated with greater improvement in depressive symptoms after ketamine administration compared to individuals whose family history of alcohol dependence was negative (FHN). This study investigated whether FHP influences ketamine's antidepressant and perceptual effects in individuals with bipolar depression. METHODS: A post hoc analysis was conducted on 33 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar disorder (BD) type I or II depression pooled from two previously published studies. All subjects had undergone a double-blind, randomized, crossover trial of a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) combined with lithium or valproate therapy. Subjects were rated at baseline; at 40, 80, 120, and 230 min; and at days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 post-infusion. The primary outcome measure was Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) scores. Patients were categorized as FHP when they reported at least one first-degree relative with alcohol dependence. Measures of psychosis, dissociation, and dysphoria were also collected. RESULTS: After ketamine infusion, subjects with FHP showed significantly greater improvement on MADRS scores than FHN subjects. In addition, patients with FHP had attenuated psychotomimetic and dissociative scores compared to FHN patients. CONCLUSIONS: FHP appears to predict a more sustained antidepressant response to ketamine in individuals with BD. Family history of alcoholism may be an important consideration in the development of glutamatergic-based therapies for depression."
"7343","1","Patterns of recreational drug use at dance events in Edinburgh, Scotland.^\nAims. To describe the patterns of drug use at dance (rave) events in terms of prevalence, frequency, type of drugs used, patterns of use, access and risk-associated behaviours. Design. Self-selecting participant-completed survey. Setting. Three dance events in Edinburgh, Scotland, UK. Participants. One hundred and twenty-two drug users (57% males, 43% females), 90% of whom were in employment or education, with an age range of 16-47, 80% between 18 and 23 years. Measurements. Participants who answered ""yes"" to the question ""Have you used drugs for dance events in the past year"" reported (i) the prevalence, types and frequency of drugs used; (ii) prevalence and contents of mixing drugs; (iii) accessing drugs; and (iv) engagement with drug-associated risk behaviours. Findings. Over 80% of the participants had used ecstasy and amphetamine, over 30% cocaine and LSD; over 10% nitrites, psilocybin and ketamine and less than 5% had used crack or tranquillizers. Participants reported regular consumption of ecstasy and amphetamine (e.g. 35% used ecstasy and 25% amphetamine on a weekly basis) often taken in combination, with the occasional use of cocaine, LSD, ketamine and psilocybin. Poly- and mixing-drug behaviours were significantly more likely than monodrug usage. Drugs were accessed through friends than from any other source. Eighty-five per cent reported mixing drugs and/or alcohol, 35% driving on drugs, 36% having a bad experience on drugs; 30% unprotected sex; and 0.9% injecting drugs. Women in the sample reported higher consumption than men. Conclusions. Dance-drug use has a characteristic pattern that has implications for health promotion and criminal policy."

"6023","1","Study Comparing Three Doses of MDMA Along With Psychotherapy in Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nPosttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental disorder, that can develop after service in the armed forces. Psychotherapy performed along with MDMA is an innovative form of therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder. This study will follow on the findings of an initial pilot study in a sample largely made up of people whose PTSD did not develop from serving in the military. This study will investigate whether MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is safe and efficacious in a sample of veterans and whether maintaining an effective double‐blind can be better addressed by performing a dose comparison study. This study is a randomized, double‐blind, dose comparison study with an open‐label cross‐over segment that will assess the safety and efficacy of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in veterans with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. Twelve of 24 participants will receive the full dose of 125 mg, six will receive 75 mg and six will receive 30 mg (active placebo dose). An independent rater blind to condition will assess symptoms of PTSD and depression, general quality of life and posttraumatic growth prior to any psychotherapy sessions one month after the second experimental session. After undergoing three 90‐minute non‐drug introductory psychotherapy sessions with a male/female co‐therapist team, study participants will undergo two eight‐hour long experimental sessions scheduled three to five weeks apart, during which they will randomly receive either 30, 75 or 125 mg MDMA on both occasions, followed by a supplemental dose of half the initial dose. Participants will undergo integrative psychotherapy in between each experimental session, including on the day after each session. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout each experimental session, and suicidality will be assessed throughout the course of the study. Spontaneously reported side effects will be collected on the day of each experimental session, and for six days afterward. PTSD symptoms, symptoms of depression, general psychological function, posttraumatic growth and quality of sleep will be assessed one month after the second experimental session, and the blind will be broken. Participants who received 125 mg MDMA will continue to have a third experimental session, and they will be assessed two months after the third experimental session. Participants who received 30 or 75 mg MDMA may take part in an open‐label crossover segment that will follow nearly identical procedures, except that there will only be one introductory session prior to the first experimental session. There will be three experimental sessions. Symptoms of PTSD, depression and posttraumatic growth will be assessed at the start of the study. They will also be assessed one month after the second and two months after the third experimental session. All participants will be assessed 12 months after their final experimental session. PTSD and depression symptoms and posttraumatic growth will be assessed, and participants will complete a questionnaire concerning the costs and benefits of being in the study."
"2227","1","Acute neuropsychological effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-)administration in healthy volunteers.^\nRATIONALE: In Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people expose themselves to 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy""). Commonly, ecstasy is used in combination with other substances, in particular alcohol (ethanol). MDMA induces both arousing as well as hallucinogenic effects, whereas ethanol is a general central nervous system depressant. OBJECTIVE: The aim of the present study is to assess the acute effects of single and co-administration of MDMA and ethanol on executive, memory, psychomotor, visuomotor, visuospatial and attention function, as well as on subjective experience. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We performed a four-way, double-blind, randomised, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine male, seven female) between the ages of 18-29. MDMA was given orally (100 mg) and blood alcohol concentration was maintained at 0.6 per thousand by an ethanol infusion regime. RESULTS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol was well tolerated and did not show greater impairment of performance compared to the single-drug conditions. Impaired memory function was consistently observed after all drug conditions, whereas impairment of psychomotor function and attention was less consistent across drug conditions. CONCLUSIONS: Co-administration of MDMA and ethanol did not exacerbate the effects of either drug alone. Although the impairment of performance by all drug conditions was relatively moderate, all induced significant impairment of cognitive function."
"4248","0","Inhibition of return in schizophrenia: A review.^\nIntroduction. - Most visual environments contain more information than the human brain can process in real time. To overcome this limitation, the attention system acts as a filter by selectively orienting attention to specific regions of the visual field. This ability to orient attention can be reflected in covert shift processes of attention. Literature findings. - In a typical covert orienting task, subjects have to maintain fixation on a central cross and respond as quickly as possible to a target, which appears in a peripheral. box following a cue that summons attention to the direction where the target is going to appear (valid cueing) or to the contralateral direction (invalid cueing). When the cues are nonpredictive, the response characteristics critically depend on stimulus-onset asynchrony (SOA). With short SOAs (< 300 ms), valid cues result in a reaction time advantage over invalid trials, which is due to a reflexive shift of attention towards the source of stimulation. In contrast, with longer SOAs, valid cues result in longer reaction times to the subsequent target. Discussion. - This phenomenon is known as the inhibition of return and is mostly thought to reflect an inhibitory mechanism protecting the organism from redirecting attention to previously scanned insignificant locations. Many studies have reported blunted or delayed inhibition of return in patients with schizophrenia. However, some authors reported normal amounts of inhibition of return. This can be partly explained by the use of manipulations of the covert orienting of the attention paradigm that is known to enhance the course of inhibition of return. Conclusion. - The deficit of inhibition of return seems to be time-stable and to be unrelated to psychopathology or length of illness. The contribution of neuroleptic medication to this deficit cannot be determined. Recent data suggest a deficit of inhibition of return in two human models of psychosis (dimethyltryptamine and ketamine). Further studies should clarify whether blunted inhibition of return might represent a trait marker of schizophrenia. (c) L'Encephale, Paris, 2008."
"7071","1","Ecstasy exposure & gender: Examining components of verbal memory functioning.^\nObjective: Studies have demonstrated verbal memory deficits associated with past year ecstasy use, although specific underlying components of these deficits are less understood. Further, prior research suggests potential gender differences in ecstasy-induced serotonergic changes. Therefore, the current study investigated whether gender moderated the relationship between ecstasy exposure and components of verbal memory after controlling for polydrug use and confounding variables. Method: Data were collected from 65 polydrug users with a wide range of ecstasy exposure (ages 18-35; 48 ecstasy and 17 marijuana users; 0-2310 ecstasy tablets). Participants completed a verbal learning and memory task, psychological questionnaires, and a drug use interview. Results: Increased past year ecstasy exposure predicted poorer short and long delayed free and cued recalls, retention, and recall discrimination. Male ecstasy users were more susceptible to dose-dependent deficits in retention than female users. Conclusion: Past year ecstasy consumption was associated with verbal memory retrieval, retention, and discrimination deficits in a dose-dependent manner in a sample of healthy young adult polydrug users. Male ecstasy users were at particular risk for deficits in retention following a long delay. Gender difference may be reflective of different patterns of polydrug use as well as increased hippocampal sensitivity. Future research examining neuronal correlates of verbal memory deficits in ecstasy users are needed."
"7300","1","Determination of Ketamine and Norketamine in Hair and Evaluation of Polydrug Use in Ketamine Abusers Using Hair Analysis in Korea.^\nThis study evaluated hair samples from 28 subjects who tested positive for ketamine at Seoul Institute National Forensic Service in Korea between 2016 and 2017. Ketamine in the hair was extracted using a solution of 1% hydrochloric acid in methanol for 16 h. Extracts were analyzed using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) or liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS-MS). The LC-MS-MS method was validated by determining the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantification (LOQ), linearity, intra- and inter-accuracy, precision and matrix effect. In 59 ketamine-positive hair or hair segments from 28 ketamine abusers, the ketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.011-335.8 ng/mg (mean, 13.6; median, 1.8), and the norketamine concentration was found to be in the range of 0.001-35.7 ng/mg (mean, 7.5; median, 0.44). The ratio of norketamine to ketamine concentrations in hair was in the range of 0.01-1.46 (mean, 0.34; median, 0.26). The distribution of ketamine concentration in hair samples was as follows: 0.01-0.1 ng/mg in 11 samples (18.6%), 0.1-5 ng/mg in 33 samples (55.9%), 5-10 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 10-15 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 15-20 ng/mg in 4 samples (6.8%), 40-45 ng/mg in 2 samples (3.4%), 45-50 ng/mg in 1 sample (1.7%) and >100 ng/mg in only 2 samples (3.4%). In the hair of ketamine abusers, 26 of 28 subjects were detected simultaneously ketamine with other drugs, including methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; n = 9), methamphetamine (MA; n = 3), MDMA/MA (n = 3), MDMA/para-methoxyamphetamine (PMA; n = 3), MDMA/PMA/MA (n = 2), cocaine (n = 1) and other drugs (n = 5, propofol, zolpidem or benzodiazepines). Along with ketamine, other controlled drugs were detected in most of the hair samples: MDMA (60.7%), MA (28.6%), PMA (17.9%), zolpidem (17.9%) and propofol (14.3%) in the frequency of abuse. In conclusion, most of the ketamine abusers (92.9%) were polydrug abusers, who were concomitantly abusing other controlled substances."
"7789","0","Prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and conduct disorder among substance abusers.^\nBACKGROUND: This cross-sectional study sought to determine the prevalence of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and conduct disorder among adults admitted to 2 chemical dependency treatment centers. It was hypothesized that ADHD alone or in combination with conduct disorder would be overrepresented in a population of patients with psychoactive substance use disorders. METHOD: Two hundred one participants were selected randomly from 2 chemical dependency treatment centers. Standardized clinical interviews were conducted using the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV, the Addiction Severity Index, and DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. Reliabilities for the diagnostic categories were established using the Cohen kappa, and the subgroups of individuals with and without ADHD and conduct disorder were compared. RESULTS: Forty-eight (24%) of the participants were found to meet DSM-IV criteria for ADHD. The prevalence of ADHD was 28% in men (30/106) and 19% in women (18/95; NS). Seventy-nine participants (39%) met criteria for conduct disorder, and 34 of these individuals also had ADHD. Overall, individuals with ADHD (compared with those without ADHD) were more likely to have had more motor vehicle accidents. Women with ADHD (in comparison with women without ADHD) had a higher number of treatments for alcohol abuse. Individuals with conduct disorder (in comparison with those without conduct disorder) were younger, had a greater number of jobs as adults, and were more likely to repeat a grade in school, have a learning disability, be suspended or expelled from school, have an earlier age at onset of alcohol dependence, and have had a greater number of treatments for drug abuse. They were more likely to have a lifetime history of abuse of and/or dependence on cocaine, stimulants, hallucinogens, and/or cannabis. CONCLUSION: A significant overrepresentation of ADHD exists among inpatients with psychoactive substance use disorders. Over two thirds of those with ADHD in this sample also met criteria for conduct disorder. Our sample had a very large overlap between ADHD and conduct disorder, and the major comorbidities identified here were attributable largely to the presence of conduct disorder. Individuals who manifest conduct disorder and/or ADHD represent a significant proportion of those seeking treatment for psychoactive substance use disorders. They appear to have greater comorbidity and may benefit from a treatment approach that addresses these comorbidities specifically through medical and behavioral therapies."

Psychological changes were assessed by psychometric rating scales. MDMA produced distributed changes in regional blood flow including increases in ventromedial frontal and occipital cortex, inferior temporal lobe and cerebellum; and decreases in the motor and somatosensory cortex, temporal lobe including left amygdala, cingulate cortex, insula and thalamus. Concomitant with these changes, subjects experienced heightened mood, increased extroversion, slight derealization and mild perceptual alterations. MDMA also produced increases in blood pressure and several side effects such as jaw clenching, lack of appetite and difficulty concentrating. These results indicate that a distributed cluster of brain areas underlie the various effects of MDMA in humans."
"2495","0","Combined effect of alcohol and cannabis on simulated driving.^\nRATIONALE: With alcohol and cannabis remaining the most commonly detected drugs in seriously and fatally injured drivers, there is a need to understand their combined effects on driving. OBJECTIVES: The present study examined the effects of combinations of smoked cannabis (12.5% THC) and alcohol (target BrAC 0.08%) on simulated driving performance, subjective drug effects, cardiovascular measures, and self-reported perception of driving ability. METHODS: In this within-subjects, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled, randomized clinical trial, cannabis users (1-7 days/week) aged 19-29 years attended four drug administration sessions in which simulated driving, subjective effects, cardiovascular measures, and whole blood THC and metabolite concentrations were assessed following placebo alcohol and placebo cannabis (<0.1% THC), alcohol and placebo cannabis, placebo alcohol and active cannabis, and alcohol and active cannabis. RESULTS: Standard deviation of lateral position in the combined condition was significantly different from the placebo condition (p < 0.001). Standard deviation of lateral position was also significantly different from alcohol and cannabis alone conditions in the single task overall drive (p = 0.029 and p = 0.032, respectively), from the alcohol alone condition in the dual task overall drive (p = 0.022) and the cannabis alone condition in the dual task straightaway drive (p = 0.002). Compared to the placebo condition, the combined and alcohol conditions significantly increased reaction time. Subjective effects in the combined condition were significantly greater than with either of the drugs alone at some time points, particularly later in the session. A driving ability questionnaire showed that participants seemed unaware of their level of impairment. CONCLUSION: Combinations of alcohol and cannabis increased weaving and reaction time, and tended to produce greater subjective effects compared to placebo and the single drug conditions suggesting a potential additive effect. The fact that participants were unaware of this increased effect has important implications for driving safety."
"1507","1","MDMA-assisted therapy for posttraumatic stress disorder: A pooled analysis of ethnoracial differences in efficacy and safety from two Phase 2 open-label lead-in trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Limited ethnoracial diversity in previous ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) trials for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has prompted questions concerning whether Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) also benefit from this treatment. METHODS: Secondary analysis was conducted using a modified intent-to-treat sample pooled from two Phase 2 open-label trials and a Phase 3 randomized, blinded placebo-controlled trial to compare efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for PTSD between BIPOC and non-Hispanic White participants. Four subgroups were of interest: MDMA-AT, BIPOC (n = 20); MDMA-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 63); Placebo-assisted therapy (Placebo-AT), BIPOC (n = 17); and Placebo-AT, non-Hispanic White (n = 27). Planned comparisons tested subgroup differences in changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) scores from baseline to primary endpoint, controlling for study type and baseline scores. Adverse events (AEs) on the day of (day 0) to 2 days post-dosing were reported for each subgroup. RESULTS: In the MDMA-AT group, no significant ethnoracial difference in CAPS-5 change scores was observed. In the Placebo-AT group, BIPOC participants trended toward greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than non-Hispanic Whites. Among non-Hispanic Whites, MDMA-AT was accompanied by significantly greater reductions in CAPS-5 scores than Placebo-AT. No treatment difference emerged among BIPOC participants. AEs were mostly rated as mild or moderate across subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide preliminary support for the efficacy and safety of MDMA-AT for treating PTSD across ethnoracial groups. There was also a trend toward greater efficacy with Placebo-AT among BIPOC participants. There was an imbalance in subgroups, highlighting the need for culturally responsive recruitment strategies to diversify future studies."

"1291","1","Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: a preliminary positron emission tomography study.^\nBACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence support a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, rapidly improves depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 20 unmedicated participants with treatment-resistant MDD underwent positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and following ketamine infusion (single dose of .5mg/kg intravenous over 40minutes). Metabolic data were compared between conditions using a combination of region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses, and differences were correlated with the associated antidepressant response. RESULTS: Whole-brain metabolism did not change significantly following ketamine. Regional metabolism decreased significantly under ketamine in the habenula, insula, and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the right hemisphere. Metabolism increased postketamine in bilateral occipital, right sensorimotor, left parahippocampal, and left inferior parietal cortices. Improvement in depression ratings correlated directly with change in metabolism in right superior and middle temporal gyri. Conversely, clinical improvement correlated inversely with metabolic changes in right parahippocampal gyrus and temporoparietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these results indicate that treatment-resistant MDD subjects showed decreased metabolism in the right habenula and the extended medial and orbital prefrontal networks in association with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine. Conversely, metabolism increased in sensory association cortices, conceivably related to the illusory phenomena sometimes experienced with ketamine. Further studies are needed to elucidate how these functional anatomical changes relate to the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects."
"1362","1","Psychedelic-Assisted Psychotherapy-A Systematic Review of Associated Psychological Interventions.^\nModern clinical research on psychedelics is generating interesting outcomes in a wide array of clinical conditions when psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy is delivered to appropriately screened participants and in controlled settings. Still, a number of patients relapse or are less responsive to such treatments. Individual and contextual factors (i.e., set and setting) seem to play a role in shaping the psychedelic experience and in determining clinical outcomes. These findings, coupled with data from literature on the effectiveness of psychotherapy, frame the therapeutic context as a potential moderator of clinical efficacy, highlighting the need to investigate how to functionally employ environmental and relational factors. In this review, we performed a structured search through two databases (i.e., PubMed/Medline and Scopus) to identify records of clinical studies on psychedelics which used and described a structured associated psychotherapeutic intervention. The aim is to construct a picture of what models of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy are currently adopted in clinical research and to report on their clinical outcomes. Ad-hoc and adapted therapeutic methods were identified. Common principles, points of divergence and future directions are highlighted and discussed with special attention toward therapeutic stance, degree of directiveness and the potential suggestive effects of information provided to patients."

Psilocybin is being tested for alcoholism, smoking cessation, and in patients with advanced cancer with anxiety. MDMA is showing encouraging results as a treatment for refractory post-traumatic stress disorder, social anxiety in autistic adults, and anxiety associated with a life-threatening illness. Both drugs are studied as adjuncts or catalysts to psychotherapy, rather than as stand-alone drug treatments. This model of drug-assisted psychotherapy is a possible alternative to existing pharmacological and psychological treatments in psychiatry. Further research is needed to fully assess the potential of these compounds in the management of these common disorders that are difficult to treat with existing methods."
"1369","1","At baseline patients treated with esketamine have higher burden of disease than other patients with treatment resistant depression: Learnings from a population based study.^\nINTRODUCTION: It is critical to assess who is being treated with a new marketed drug like esketamine to understand how it is used in the real-world setting and the effects of the medication. METHODS: Retrospective analysis using two large U.S. health care databases that included commercially insured and Medicaid patients. Patients treated with esketamine were identified and their baseline characteristics described and compared with the baseline characteristics of patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) and with patients undergoing transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). To quantify the differences, standardized mean differences were calculated. RESULTS: In the commercially insured database, 418 patients were treated with esketamine and 830,047 patients were in the TRD group. Large differences in baseline characteristics were observed. Patients in the esketamine group were more likely to have severe depression, suicidal thoughts, and prior treatments with TMS or electroconvulsive therapy than the TRD control group. Patients in the esketamine group had more comorbid psychiatric conditions (anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disorders, substance use disorders) and higher exposure to antipsychotics, antiepileptics, hypnotics and sedatives. In terms of general health, patients in the esketamine group had many more outpatient visits, were more likely to have chronic pain and higher Charlson comorbidity scores, a predicator of mortality. Results were similar for both the Medicaid and TMS populations. CONCLUSION: Patients treated with esketamine have a higher burden of disease than other patients with TRD. In any real-world comparative effectiveness or safety study these differences need to be understood and accounted for to produce valid results."
"8235","0","Day-level associations between drug use and sexual behavior in male couples: Actor partner interdependence modeling of timeline follow-back data.^\nBackground: Both marijuana and other illicit drugs (e.g., cocaine/crack, methamphetamines, ecstasy, gamma-hydroxybuterate, and ketamine) have been linked to the occurrence of condomless anal sex (CAS) with casual partners among sexual minority men (SMM) and these associations largely generalize to partnered SMM. Software advances now permit testing the day-level correspondence between participants’ sexual behavior and their own drug use (actor effects) as well as their partners’ (partner-effects). Methods: Participants comprised 50 couples (100 individuals) recruited in the New York City metro area. All were 18 or older and identified as cis male. In each couple, at least one partner was 18–29 years old, HIV-negative, reported recent (past 30 day) drug use and recent (past 30 day) CAS with a casual partner or CAS with a non-monogamous or sero-discordant main partner at screening. Results: Marijuana was associated with CAS between main partners on days both partners reported its use. A similar pattern was observed for other illicit drugs. Respondents were more likely to report CAS with casual partners on days CAS between main partners occurred. Both marijuana and other illicit drugs were associated with increased likelihood of CAS with casual partners on days a main partner did not use drugs. These associations were attenuated on days where partners reported the use of different drugs. Conclusions: The co-occurrence of CAS with main and casual partners maximizes shared sexual risk. Results support the continued emphasis on dyadic HIV prevention interventions and the development of theoretically-based interventions that may address drug use by both partners in the relationship.

"2348","1","Effects of sevoflurane or ketamine on the QTc interval during electroconvulsive therapy.^\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the effect of sevoflurane or ketamine on the corrected QT (QTc) interval and the interval from the peak to the end of the T wave (Tp-e) during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) in patients with major depression. METHODS: This prospective, randomized, double-blinded study included 24 patients that were randomly allocated to receive sevoflurane (group S) or ketamine (group K) for ECT session. Group S patients received 8 % sevoflurane for anesthesia induction, which was maintained at 2-4 % until delivery of the electrical stimulus. Group K patients received a bolus of ketamine (1 mg/kg). The mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) and the electrocardiogram (ECG) were recorded before (T1) and after induction of anesthesia (T2) and 0, 1, 3, and 10 min after the electrical stimuli ended (T3, T4, T5, and T6, respectively). RESULTS: In both groups, the QTc interval was significantly longer at T2, T4, T5, and T6 than at baseline. The QTc interval was longer at T4, T5, and T6 in group S compared to that in group K, the Tp-e interval was significantly longer at T4 in group K both baseline and group S. The HR in group S was increased at T4 compared with group K. MAP was significantly higher after induction of anesthesia in group K compared to those in group S at all time points. CONCLUSIONS: Although group S showed a prolonged QTc interval after ECT compared to group K, the Tp-e interval in both groups was not significantly affected clinically. Sevoflurane blunted MAP and peak HR."

Methods: We performed a retrospective review of cases involving ecstasy intoxication reported to the California Poison Control System and recorded in its computerized database from January 1, 2000, through October 9, 2005. We excluded cases that did not involve MDMA exposure or in which there were no symptoms or were minimal effects only. Confirmation of exposure to MDMA was based on history of use and, when available, urine toxicology testing results positive for MDMA or amphetamine derivatives. Hyponatremia was defined as a measured serum sodium level less than 130 mmol/L. Results: A total of 1,436 cases potentially involving ecstasy were reported to the California Poison Control System during the 5-year study period, of which 891 were excluded according to the criteria described above. Of the 545 cases that met inclusion criteria, 296 (54.3%) were women and 249 (45.7%) were men. There were 188 cases (34.5%) with a documented serum sodium level, of which 73 (38.8%) reported hyponatremia (Na <130 mmol/L). Of the 73 subjects with hyponatremia, 55 (75.3%) were women and 18 (24.7%) men; of the 115 nonhyponatremic subjects, 50 (43.5%) were women and 65 (56.5%) were men. Among patients with a documented serum sodium level, female sex was associated with increased odds of hyponatremia (odds ratio [OR] 4.0; 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1 to 7.6). Among women, those with hyponatremia demonstrated increased odds of coma (OR 3.9; 95% CI 1.2 to 12.9), whereas among men, no increased odds of hyponatremia-associated coma were observed (OR 0.8; 95% CI 0.15 to 4.0). Conclusion: Female sex was associated with increased odds of hyponatremia and increased odds of hyponatremia-associated coma among persons with ecstasy intoxication and a documented serum sodium level reported to the California Poison Control System from 2000 to 2005. Multiple potential confounders, including spectrum bias, incomplete laboratory data, and individual differences in study subject characteristics, prevent determination of causality about sex differences in the incidence of ecstasy-associated hyponatremia and its complications. © 2007 American College of Emergency Physicians."
"1811","1","Ayahuasca and tobacco smoking cessation: results from an online survey in Brazil.^\nRationale: Smoking-related disease is a major problem globally. Effective smoking cessation treatments are however limited. Increasing evidence suggests that psychedelics have potential as treatments for substance use disorders and may therefore prove an option in aiding smoking cessation. Objectives: To establish which factors predict smoking cessation in people who reported quitting or reducing smoking following ayahuasca consumption. Methods: A retrospective cross-sectional mixed-method study (quantitative and qualitative design) was undertaken using data from an online survey evaluating peoples’ experiences before and after drinking ayahuasca. Multivariate logistic regression was performed with smoking condition (cessation or reduction/relapse) as a dependent variable and demographics, smoking, ayahuasca-related variables and the mystical experience (MEQ30) as predicting factors. Results: A total of 441 responses were grouped according to self-reported smoking status: cessation (n = 305) or reduction/relapse (n = 136) smoking. Logistic regression showed that mystical experience (OR: 1.03; 95% CI [1.00–1.05]) and frequency of ayahuasca intake (OR: 2.16[1.00–4.70]) were protective factors, while positive mood (measured by the MEQ30) during the ayahuasca experience was a risk factor (OR: 0.91[0.85–0.97]). Qualitative thematic analysis identified eight themes (e.g. acquired awareness, spiritual experience, increased motivation) related to the ayahuasca experience and the process of smoking cessation/reduction. Conclusions: Our results suggest that ayahuasca could be used as a potential tool for smoking cessation, and that effects may be mediated by mystical experience. Given the current burden of smoking-related disease and the limited treatment options, studies are needed to investigate the efficacy of psychedelics in smoking cessation."
"3416","0","Rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine, its metabolites and other candidates: A historical overview and future perspective.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling psychiatric disorders. Approximately one-third of the patients with MDD are treatment resistant to the current antidepressants. There is also a significant therapeutic time lag of weeks to months. Furthermore, depression in patients with bipolar disorder (BD) is typically poorly responsive to antidepressants. Therefore, there exists an unmet medical need for rapidly acting antidepressants with beneficial effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Accumulating evidence suggests that the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine produces rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant patients with MDD or BD. Ketamine is a racemic mixture comprising equal parts of (R)-ketamine (or arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (or esketamine). Because (S)-ketamine has higher affinity for NMDAR than (R)-ketamine, esketamine was developed as an antidepressant. On 5 March 2019, esketamine nasal spray was approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. However, preclinical data suggest that (R)-ketamine exerts greater potency and longer-lasting antidepressant effects than (S)-ketamine in animal models of depression and that (R)-ketamine has less detrimental side-effects than (R,S)-ketamine or (S)-ketamine. In this article, the author reviews the historical overview of the antidepressant actions of enantiomers of ketamine and its major metabolites norketamine and hydroxynorketamine. Furthermore, the author discusses the other potential rapid-acting antidepressant candidates (i.e., NMDAR antagonists and modulators, low-voltage-sensitive T-type calcium channel inhibitor, potassium channel Kir4.1 inhibitor, negative modulators of gamma-aminobutyric acid, and type A [GABA(A)] receptors) to compare them with ketamine. Moreover, the molecular and cellular mechanisms of ketamine's antidepressant effects are discussed."
"6024","0","Combined Ketamine/Propofol for Emergency Department Procedural Sedation.^\nIntroduction Numerous drugs and combinations of drugs are used for procedural sedation and analgesia (PSA) in Emergency Departments, including propofol, ketamine, benzodiazepines, narcotics, barbiturates, and others, but propofol has gained popularity despite its potential to cause cardiac and respiratory depression. Obviously the optimal agent or combination of agents has not been identified. There are reasons to believe that a combination of ketamine and propofol may have advantages over other agents/combinations. These include better hemodynamic stability at equal depth of anesthesia with a combination of ketamine/propofol than with propofol alone, less respiratory depression with the combination in comparison to propofol alone, and preservation of respiratory drive with the combination. There is one study of ketamine/propofol in Emergency Department (ED) procedural sedation which demonstrated the safety and effectiveness of the combination, but did not compare it to any other agents or combinations. We designed a randomized, placebo controlled study to compare propofol to propofol and ketamine for adequacy of sedation and respiratory depression in Emergency Department procedural sedation and analgesia. Our hypothesis was that the combination of propofol/ketamine would produce better sedation and/or less respiratory depression than propofol alone. Methods Study design We conducted a randomized, prospective, double‐blinded study of all patients receiving procedural sedation. From May 2007 until March 2009 in the ED of a 274 bed university teaching hospital. The study was approved by the University of Missouri's Institutional Review Board and informed consent was obtained from all participants. Study setting and population All patients requiring PSA in the ED were viewed as potential subjects unless they were pregnant, less than 1 year of age, history of prior adverse reaction to anesthesia, underlying cardiac or pulmonary disease, hepatic dysfunction, porphyria, psychiatric illness, allergy to eggs/soybeans, increased intracranial or intraocular pressure, abnormal airway pathology or an American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) score of 3 or greater. The attending ED physician would then approach the patient to enroll them in the study. If the patient accepted they were randomized by the hospital pharmacy. Study protocol An ED attending physician was dedicated to PSA throughout the procedure. Patients had EKG, blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse oximetry, and end‐tidal carbon dioxide (PetCO2) monitored, had IV access obtained and were placed on nasal cannula oxygen supplementation. All patients received pre‐procedure analgesia with 0.5 to 1.5 mcg/Kg of fentanyl and all patients had reflective sunglasses placed so as to obscure eye movements from the staff. Subjects were randomized by the pharmacy in blocks of ten. Consecutively numbered pre‐filled 3cc syringes were prepared by the pharmacy staff once they received a signed and dated study enrollment sheet from the ER staff with the patients weight in kilograms provided. All physicians, nurses, patients and study personnel were blinded to the contents of the syringes which were hand delivered by pharmacy personnel. The quantity of all drugs delivered were recorded. During the procedure all patients were monitored for 5 respiratory depression markers: ‐ PetCO2 rise of ³ 5 mm/Hg ‐ Respiratory rate < 8 br/min ‐ arterial oxygen saturation (SaO2) < 90% ‐ Apnea ³ 15 seconds ‐ Airway manipulation Physicians were permitted to intervene and provide any supportive/resuscitative measures at there discretion despite the pre‐specified respiratory depression markers. 1. Not satisfied 2. Somewhat satisfied 3. Satisfied Patients were randomized to receive either 0.5 mg/Kg of ketamine or placebo (normal saline) delivered to the emergency room sedating physician in a 3 cc syringe containing a clear/colorless solution. This solution was delivered intravenously over a one minute infusion. On completion of this infusion all patients received propofol start ng at 1 mg/Kg over 2 minutes and supplemented with repeated boluses of 0.5 mg/Kg to maintain adequate sedation. Patients were felt to be adequately sedated once they received a Colorado Behavioral Numerical Pain Scale (CBNPS) score of 0 to 113(table 1.) Patients were monitored after the procedure until a normal level of consciousness was observed. All data were collected and recorded on standardized Hospital PSA forms. Data was collected for the entire time frame of the individual procedural sedations. Following the completion of the procedural sedation a second form was filled out by both the sedating physician and monitoring nurse recording specifically any respiratory events/rescue interventions and overall satisfaction with the procedural sedation. The overall quality of the PSA was evaluated by the physician/nurse performing the sedation as one of the following: 4. Very satisfied 5. Excellent All data was recorded on a secure computer in spreadsheet form (Microsoft Excel 2003, Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, WA) for later analysis. Outcome Measures Four endpoints were defined prior to study initiation: Respiratory Depression. A difference in evidence of respiratory depression between the groups. Respiratory depression was defined as the occurrence of any of the 5 markers. Satisfaction with PSA. A difference in the evaluation of the quality of the sedation by the providers. Quality of PSA. Number of patients with a CBNPS of 0. Propofol usage. Did the addition of ketamine significantly reduce the amount of propofol needed to produce adequate PSA. Data analysis We plan to enroll 100 patients in each group. This is based on an estimate of a 40% incidence of respiratory depression with propofol alone, a reduction to 20% with the combination of ketamine/propofol, an a of 0.05 and a power of 0.8.14‐16. An interim analysis was conducted at enrollment of 100 patients using a significance of 0.025 for difference in respiratory depression. Respiratory depression and CBNPS were compared using a chi‐squared test and Satisfaction with PSA and Quality of PSA were compared using a t‐test. Tests were done with Primer of Biostatistics (Version 6.0, Stanton A. Glantz, 2005)."
"126","1","Problems encountered when testing for LSD in a regional medium secure unit.^\nAims and method: Between 1998 and 2000, a suprisingly high number of positive results was noticed in our regional medium secure uni when testing for D-lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). This led to an investigation of possible factors involved. It was felt that the testing protocol, particularly the use of a single, non-isotopic homogeneous immunoassay without routine further confirmatory testing, was largely to blame for what seemed to be a high incidence of false positives. On two different occasions, samples from each patient were sent, on the same day, to two different laboratories. At the first laboratory, only one test method was used and at the second one test plus two confirmatory tests were carried out. Results: Out of a total of 23 patients tested on two separate occasions, the first laboratory gave three positive results the first time and three positive results the second, while the second laboratory gave only one positive result on the second occasion that samples were sent and none on the first. This reinforces the belief that, without adequate confirmatory analysis, many psychiatric and non-psychiatric prescribed drugs can give false positives. Clinical implications: Positive LSD results should be confirmed by at least one, preferably chormatographic, alternative method. A protocol for testing and reporting LSD in psychiatric patients should be considered in order to minimise the risk of obtaining false-positive results which have negative clinical, legal and psychological repercussions."
"2078","1","Dr. Leary's Concord Prison Experiment: a 34-year follow-up study.^\nThis study is a long-term follow-up to the Concord Prison Experiment, one of the best-known studies in the psychedelic psychotherapy literature. The Concord Prison Experiment was conducted from 1961 to 1963 by a team of researchers at Harvard University under the direction of Timothy Leary. The original study involved the administration of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy to 32 prisoners in an effort to reduce recidivism rates. This follow-up study involved a search through the state and federal criminal justice system records of 21 of the original 32 subjects, as well as personal interviews with two of the subjects and three of the researchers: Timothy Leary, Ralph Metzner and Gunther Weil. The results of the follow-up study indicate that published claims of a treatment effect were erroneous. This follow-up study supports the emphasis in the original reports on the necessity of embedding psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy with inmates within a comprehensive treatment plan that includes post-release, nondrug group support programs. Despite substantial efforts by the experimental team to provide post-release support, these services were not made sufficiently available to the subjects in this study. Whether a new program of psilocybin-assisted group psychotherapy and post-release programs would significantly reduce recidivism rates is an empirical question that deserves to be addressed within the context of a new experiment."
"2182","0","Recreational drug use: a major risk factor for gastroschisis?.^\nThe authors tested the hypothesis that the birth prevalence of gastroschisis is positively associated with use of recreational drugs in early pregnancy. A matched case-control study was carried out in three regions of the United Kingdom over the period January 2001 through August 2003. For each case, three liveborn controls were matched by initial intended place of delivery, region, and maternal age. Maternal hair analysis provided independent verification of recreational drug use. Conditional logistic regression was used to estimate mutually adjusted odds ratios. Estimates were revised using data from hair analysis. Statistically significant adjusted odds ratios for gastroschisis were associated with first-trimester use of 1) any recreational drug (odds ratio (OR) = 2.2, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.2, 4.3) and 2) vasoconstrictive recreational drugs (defined as cocaine, amphetamines, and ecstasy) (OR = 3.3, 95% CI: 1.0, 10.5). Other significant exposures included aspirin use (OR = 20.4, 95% CI: 2.2, 191.5), cigarette smoking (OR = 1.7, 95% CI: 1.1, 2.6), and prior history of gynecologic infection/disease (OR = 2.6, 95% CI: 1.2, 5.6). Recreational drug use is a significant risk factor for gastroschisis and is one of a constellation of potentially preventable exposures which include cigarette smoking, aspirin use, and history of gynecologic infection/disease. Maternal hair analysis proved an acceptable and valuable method of independently verifying recreational drug use."
"8525","0","Psilocin acutely alters sleep-wake architecture and cortical brain activity in laboratory mice.^\nSerotonergic psychedelic drugs, such as psilocin (4-hydroxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine), profoundly alter the quality of consciousness through mechanisms which are incompletely understood. Growing evidence suggests that a single psychedelic experience can positively impact long-term psychological well-being, with relevance for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, including depression. A prominent factor associated with psychiatric disorders is disturbed sleep, and the sleep-wake cycle is implicated in the homeostatic regulation of neuronal activity and synaptic plasticity. However, it remains largely unknown to what extent psychedelic agents directly affect sleep, in terms of both acute arousal and homeostatic sleep regulation. Here, chronic electrophysiological recordings were obtained in mice to track sleep-wake architecture and cortical activity after psilocin injection. Administration of psilocin led to delayed REM sleep onset and reduced NREM sleep maintenance for up to approximately 3 h after dosing, and the acute EEG response was associated primarily with an enhanced oscillation around 4 Hz. No long-term changes in sleep-wake quantity were found. When combined with sleep deprivation, psilocin did not alter the dynamics of homeostatic sleep rebound during the subsequent recovery period, as reflected in both sleep amount and EEG slow-wave activity. However, psilocin decreased the recovery rate of sleep slow-wave activity following sleep deprivation in the local field potentials of electrodes targeting the medial prefrontal and surrounding cortex. It is concluded that psilocin affects both global vigilance state control and local sleep homeostasis, an effect which may be relevant for its antidepressant efficacy. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"4683","1","Subanesthetic doses of ketamine stimulate psychosis in schizophrenia.^\nWe administered ketamine to schizophrenic individuals in a double-blind, placebo-controlled design using a range of subanesthetic doses (0.1, 0.3, and 0.5 mg/kg) to evaluate the nature, dose characteristics, time course, and neuroleptic modulation of N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist action on mental status in schizophrenia. Ketamine induced a dose-related, short (< 30 minutes) worsening in mental status in the haloperidol-treated condition, reflected by a significant increase in BPRS total score for the 0.3 mg/kg (p = .005) and 0.5 mg/kg (p = .01) challenges. Positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, thought disorder), not negative symptoms accounted for these changes. These ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms were strikingly reminiscent of the subject's symptoms during active episodes of their illness. Results from six patients who were retested in the same design after being neuroleptic-free for 4 weeks failed to indicate that haloperidol blocks ketamine-induced psychosis. Several subjects evidenced delayed or prolonged (8-24 hours) psychotomimetic effects such as worsening of psychosis with visual hallucinations. These data suggest that antagonism of NMDA-sensitive glutamatergic transmission in brain exacerbates symptoms of schizophrenia."

Forty-two patients were enrolled into the controlled trial and randomized into two groups: ketamine group and midazolam group. Patients from the two groups received a sub-anesthetic dose of racemic ketamine hydrochloride or midazolam. Suicidal ideation score, measured with the Beck Scale and suicidal part of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, significantly decreased on day 1 and day 3 in ketamine-treated patients when compared to those treated with midazolam. Consistently, overall depression levels measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale indicated a significant relief of overall depression on day 1 in ketamine-treated patients. Collectively, this study provides novel information about the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine on acute depression and suicidal ideation in newly-diagnosed cancer patients."
"6211","0","Antidepressant Effects of Nitrous Oxide.^\nThe investigators are conducting a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the antidepressant effects of nitrous oxide in people with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD). MDD is a global medical condition that causes significant health and economic burden. Recent studies have shown that a single dose of ketamine, an NMDA‐antagonist, has fast and long lasting anti‐depressant effect. Nitrous oxide, another NMDA‐antagonist, is widely used for anesthesia and analgesia, safer to administer and has fewer side effects than ketamine. A randomized controlled crossover feasibility study showed significant reduction in depressive symptoms at 2 and 24 hours after a single 1‐hour treatment session of inhaled nitrous oxide compared with placebo. Nitrous oxide is inexpensive and can be safely administered by any trained clinician. If found to be efficacious, it could be used to provide rapid anti‐depressant effect whilst the benefit of traditional anti‐depressants has its delayed effect. Another potential application could be in acutely suicidal patients. This trial will enable confirmation and extension of the findings from the feasibility study, and identify the optimal dose and regimen in a broader population of those with MDD. Participants will be randomized to receive a weekly 1‐hour inhalational session of either nitrous oxide or placebo (oxygen‐air mixture) for 4 weeks, and the nitrous group will be further randomly assigned to a dose of 50% or 25% nitrous oxide. Depression severity and outcomes related to treatment responses will be continuously assessed by a 'blinded���to‐randomization' psychiatry (MD) rater at weekly intervals during study patient participation, using validated psychiatric diagnostics (Hamilton Depression Rating Scale‐21 [HDRS‐21 or HAM‐D]; Profile of Mood States [POMS]; Computerized Adaptive Test‐Mental Health [CAT‐MH]; Sheehan‐STS [S‐STS]; Visual Analog Scale [VAS])."

Grunebaum, James W. Murrough, Colleen Loo, Andrea Cipriani and Keith Hawton (Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry, 2020[Jan], Vol 54[1], 29-45). In the original article, a statement regarding conflicts of interest should have been included by the author Dr. James W Murrough. This was an inadvertent omission on the part of the author. The statement is given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-80175-007[/rid]). Objective: Ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in treatment-resistant depression. But it is not known how quickly this occurs and how long it persists. We undertook a systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the short- and long-term effectiveness of ketamine for suicidality. Method: CENTRAL, EMBASE, Medline, and PsycINFO were searched until 12 December 2018. Randomised controlled trials of ketamine or esketamine reporting data on suicidal ideation, self-harm, attempted or completed suicide in adults diagnosed with any psychiatric disorder were included. Two reviewers independently extracted data, and certainty of evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation tool. Standardised mean difference was used for continuous outcomes. Results: Twenty-five reports from 15 independent trials, with a total of 572 participants diagnosed with predominately affective disorders, were included. The evidence was rated moderate to low. In most trials, ketamine was administered at 0.5 mg/kg via a single intravenous infusion over a 30- to 45-minute period. Only a single trial of intranasal esketamine was identified. At 4 hours post-infusion, treatment with ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in suicidal ideation scores (standardised mean difference = −0.51, 95% confidence interval = [−1.00, −0.03]), which persisted until 72 hours post-infusion (time points between 12 and 24 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.63, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.26]; between 24 and 72 hours: standardised mean difference = −0.57, 95% confidence interval = [−0.99, −0.14]), but not thereafter. However, there was marked heterogeneity of results. In a single trial of esketamine, marginal effects on suicidal ideation were observed. In terms of actual suicidal behaviour, there were virtually no data on effects of ketamine or esketamine. Conclusion: A single infusion of ketamine may have a short-term (up to 72 hours) beneficial impact on suicidal thoughts. While confirmation of these results in further trials is needed, they suggest possible use of ketamine to treat acute suicidality. Means of sustaining any anti-suicidal effect need to be found.

"2084","0","A clinical approach to treatment resistance in depressed patients: What to do when the usual treatments don't work well enough?.^\nBackground Major depressive disorder is a common, recurrent, disabling and costly disorder that is often severe and/or chronic, and for which non-remission on guideline concordant first-line antidepressant treatment is the norm. A sizeable percentage of patients diagnosed with MDD do not achieve full remission after receiving antidepressant treatment. How to understand or approach these 'refractory', 'TRD' or 'difficult to treat' patients need to be revisited. Treatment resistant depression (TRD) has been described elsewhere as failure to respond to adequate treatment by two different antidepressants. This definition is problematic as it suggests that TRD is a subtype of major depressive disorder (MDD), inferring a boundary between TRD and depression that is not treatment resistant. However, there is scant evidence to suggest that a discrete TRD entity exists as a distinct subtype of MDD, which itself is not a discrete or homogeneous entity. Similarly, the boundary between TRD and other forms of depression is predicated at least in part on regulatory and research requirements rather than biological evidence or clinical utility. Aim This paper aims to investigate the notion of treatment failure in order to understand (i) what is TRD in the context of a broader formulation based on the understanding of depression, (ii) what factors make an individual patient difficult to treat, and (iii) what is the appropriate and individualised treatment strategy, predicated on an individual with refractory forms of depression? Method Expert contributors to this paper were sought internationally by contacting representatives of key professional societies in the treatment of MDD - World Federation of Societies for Biological Psychiatry, Australasian Society for Bipolar and Depressive Disorders, International Society for Affective Disorders, Collegium Internationale Neuro-Psychopharmacologium and the Canadian Network for Mood and Anxiety Treatments. The manuscript was prepared through iterative editing. Outcomes The concept of TRD as a discrete subtype of MDD, defined by failure to respond to pharmacotherapy, is not supported by evidence. Between 15 and 30% of depressive episodes fail to respond to adequate trials of 2 antidepressants, and 68% of individuals do not achieve remission from depression after a first-line course of antidepressant treatment. Failure to respond to antidepressant treatment, somatic therapies or psychotherapies may often reflect other factors including; biological resistance, diagnostic error, limitations of current therapies, psychosocial variables, a past history of exposure to childhood maltreatment or abuse, job satisfaction, personality disorders, co-morbid mental and physical disorders, substance use or non-adherence to treatment. Only a subset of patients not responding to antidepressant treatment can be explained through pharmacokinetic or pharmacodynamics mechanisms. We propose that non remitting MDD should be personalised, and propose a strategy of 'deconstructing depression'. By this approach, the clinician considers which factors contribute to making this individual both depressed and 'resistant' to previous therapeutic approaches. Clinical formulation is required to understand the nature of the depression. Many predictors of response are not biological, and reflect a confluence of biological, psychological, and sociocultural factors, which may influence the illness in a particular individual. After deconstructing depression at a personalised level, a personalised treatment plan can be constructed. The treatment plan needs to address the factors that have contributed to the individual's hard to treat depression. In addition, an individual with a history of illness may have a lot of accumulated life issues due to consequences of their illness, and these should be addressed in a recovery plan. Limitations A 'deconstructing depression' qualitative rubric does not easily provide clear inclusion and exclusion criteria for researchers wanting to investigate TRD. Conclusions MDD is a polymorphic disorder and many individuals who fail to respond to standard pharmacotherapy and are considered hard to treat. These patients are best served by personalised approaches that deconstruct the factors that have contributed to the patient's depression and implementing a treatment plan that adequately addresses these factors. The existence of TRD as a discrete and distinct subtype of MDD, defined by two treatment failures, is not supported by evidence."

Design, Setting, Participants: A cross-sectional survey, administered at university-based ambulatory reproductive health clinics, was completed by 904 women between April and November of 1997 to identify risk factors associated with their use of LSD within the past 12 months. Subjects who reported lifetime, but not past 12 months', use of marijuana, LSD, or other illicit drugs were excluded, leaving a sample of 368 nonusers and 56 users of LSD. In addition, 231 young women who reported only using marijuana in the last year were used as a comparison group to identify unique factors associated with LSD use. Results: Of the total sample (n=904), 13% (n=119) reported lifetime use of LSD, and 58% (n=536) reported lifetime use of marijuana. Logistic regression analyses controlling for age and race/ethnicity found distinct profiles for those who reported using LSD or only marijuana in the last year when compared to those who reported no substance use. Common to both groups was reporting being drunk at least 10 times during the last year, regular smoking of at least half a pack of cigarettes, and identification as a high-sexual-risk taker. However, LSD users as compared to nonusers were more likely to report white ethnicity (as compared to nonwhite), be less than or equal to 17 years of age (as compared to at least 18 years), report a history of physical abuse, and be categorized as having severe depressive symptomatology. In contrast, those who reported only using marijuana were more likely to report single marital status, young age at first intercourse, having half or more of their friends use marijuana, and poor grades. Conclusions: The female LSD user presents a distinct profile that might aid clinicians in identifying potential LSD use in this population as well as alerting clinicians to the relationship between LSD use and high-risk sexual behaviors."
"4996","0","Subjective effects in humans following administration of party pill drugs BZP and TFMPP alone and in combination.^\nThe use of piperazine derivatives, colloquially named 'party pills', has been escalating in New Zealand and worldwide since their introduction in the 1990s. Benzylpiperazine (BZP) is often used alone, or can be combined with trifluoromethylphenylpiperazine (TFMPP). Taken together as an oral dose, they have been reported to produce effects similar to 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). While the pharmacokinetic data have recently been published, little research has been conducted on the subjective effects of these piperazines on humans. This paper outlines the subjective effects observed following oral doses of BZP (200 mg) and TFMPP (60 mg) alone, or in combination (100/30 mg) compared to placebo. Participants were asked to comment on the subjective effects of each drug using three subjective rating scales-the Addiction Center Research Inventory (ARCI), the Profile of Mood States (POMS), and the Visual Analog Scales (VAS)-before and approximately 120 min after a single dose. BZP showed significant dexamphetamine-like stimulant effects, inducing euphoria, sociability, and drug liking, whereas TFMPP induced fewer stimulant-like effects and increased anxiety, via its serotonergic effects. The combination of BZP and TFMPP induced similar subjective effects, along with well-characterized dexamphetamine- and MDMA-like effects. These subjective data allow for obvious comparisons to be made between party pill drugs and other commonly known stimulants. However, despite estimates of over 20 million doses sold in New Zealand alone and increasing seizures by the Drug Enforcement Administration in the USA, there are no published cases of dependence worldwide. The long-term effects of regular party pill use are also unknown, and create the potential for future research."
"3780","1","MDMA enhances ""mind reading"" of positive emotions and impairs ""mind reading"" of negative emotions.^\nRATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) increases sociability. The prosocial effects of MDMA may result from the release of the ""social hormone"" oxytocin and associated alterations in the processing of socioemotional stimuli. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated the effects of MDMA (125 mg) on the ability to infer the mental states of others from social cues of the eye region in the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test. The study included 48 healthy volunteers (24 men, 24 women) and used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects design. A choice reaction time test was used to exclude impairments in psychomotor function. We also measured circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels and subjective drug effects. RESULTS: MDMA differentially affected mind reading depending on the emotional valence of the stimuli. MDMA enhanced the accuracy of mental state decoding for positive stimuli (e.g., friendly), impaired mind reading for negative stimuli (e.g., hostile), and had no effect on mind reading for neutral stimuli (e.g., reflective). MDMA did not affect psychomotor performance, increased circulating oxytocin and cortisol levels, and produced subjective prosocial effects, including feelings of being more open, talkative, and closer to others. CONCLUSIONS: The shift in the ability to correctly read socioemotional information toward stimuli associated with positive emotional valence, together with the prosocial feelings elicited by MDMA, may enhance social approach behavior and sociability when MDMA is used recreationally and facilitate therapeutic relationships in MDMA-assisted psychotherapeutic settings."
"5925","1","Overcoming blinding confounds in psychedelic randomized controlled trials using biomarker driven causal mediation analysis.^\nINTRODUCTION: There is great interest in the use of psychedelic-assisted therapies to treat a range of mental health conditions and initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have generated positive results. However, the effect sizes reported in psychedelic RCTs are likely inflated due to expectancy effects due to the de-blinding of both participants and study personnel to treatment allocation caused by the distinctive psychoactive effects of psychedelic drugs. AREAS COVERED: An introduction to causal inference for RCTs, the underlying assumptions, and potential confounders along with graphical illustrations is provided. It is proposed that causal mediation analysis using objectively measured mediating biomarkers could be used to identify causal pathways between treatment and outcome in psychedelic RCTs, even with de-blinding of participants and give greater confidence as to the mechanistic basis and efficacy of psychedelic therapies. EXPERT OPINION: It is argued that psychedelic therapies should not be approved as licensed medicines until causal pathways are clearly established between treatment and outcome. Potential downsides of doing so include, future indication expansion based on low quality clinical trial evidence, the approval of other therapies based on similarly low-quality evidence, and the potential for efficacy to change over time after approvals has been granted."
"1098","1","QEEG changes and psychotomimetic symptoms underlying the antidepressant response to ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder.^\nBackground. Ketamine produces fast‐acting antidepressantlike effects, although the underlying mechanism is not fully understood. In our study the time‐course of ketamine effect was assessed in depressive patients by QEEG to elucidate changes associated with treatment response. Methods. Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to assess the effect of single infusion of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) in 30 depressive inpatients. EEG data were analyzed 10 minutes, 30 minutes, 1 day, 3 days, and 7 days after ketamine administration using sLORETA. Response was defined as ≥50% reduction of MADRS (Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale) score. Results. Ketamine induced an acute (10 and 30 minutes) decrease of parietooccipital alpha and an increase of gamma‐sources in all subjects. Eleven of 27 subjects who responded to medication (41%) were characterized by excess of mediofrontal delta/theta sources in comparison to nonresponders. Only the responders showed decreased fast activities in the left temporal lobe 1, 3, and 7 days after infusion, while no significant changes were observed in nonresponders. We found a significant correlation between the intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms during infusion and the alleviation of depressive symptoms at day 7. Conclusion. Our results suggest that an acute increase of theta/delta at mediofrontal sources may characterize response to ketamine. Antidepressant effect seems to be connected with each patient's psychotomimetic experience."
"860","0","Clinical vs. laboratory identification of drugs of abuse in patients admitted for acute poisoning.^\nObjective. The extent of drug abuse in patients admitted for self-poisonings is uncertain. The aim of this study was to assess the pattern of drugs of abuse among patients admitted for acute poisoning according to age and gender, and to study the concordance between the clinical assessments by the physicians on duty and the drug analyses. Methods. Prospective cross sectional study of all patients (n = 405, 52% males, median age 31 years) treated for acute poisoning in our department during one year (2001). The physician on-call classified type of drug of abuse by history and clinical assessment. This was later compared to urine and blood samples analysed for ethanol, benzodiazepines, opiates, cocaine, ecstasy, GHB, amphetamine and cannabis. Results. In 320 admissions ( 79 %), the comparison between clinical diagnosis and laboratory analyses could be performed. A total of 478 drugs were suspected and 621 were found. The main toxic agents found were benzodiazepines (49.7%), ethanol (40.3%), opiates (35.3%), cannabis (23.8%) and amphetamine (21.3%). Ninety-two had used drugs of abuse. The agreement between clinical assessments and laboratory findings was best for GHB and ethanol (kappa = 0.43), and for opiates (k = 0.38). For benzodiazepines and cannabis, the concordance was poor (k = 0.18 and 0.10, respectively). However, the correct clinical evaluation for these substances was 59% and 77%, respectively. Conclusions. Drugs of abuse were more frequently found than suspected clinically. Benzodiazepines, ethanol and opiates were most common. The agreement between clinical assessment and drug analyses was moderate to low. Physicians seem to underestimate the use of these drugs. Copyright © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"2162","1","Effect of Esketamine Nasal Spray on Olfactory Function and Nasal Tolerability in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression: Results from Four Multicenter, Randomized, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled, Phase III Studies.^\nBACKGROUND: Intranasal drug delivery offers a non-invasive and convenient dosing option for patients and physicians, especially for conditions requiring chronic/repeated-treatment administration. However, in some cases such delivery may be harmful to nasal and olfactory epithelia. OBJECTIVE: The aim of this study was to assess the potential impact of long-term intermittent treatment with esketamine nasal spray, taken in conjunction with an oral antidepressant (AD), on olfactory function and nasal tolerability in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: A total of 1142 patients with TRD participated from four multicenter, randomized, double-blind, phase III studies: three short-term studies (two in patients aged 18-64 years, one in patients ≥65 years), and one long-term maintenance study of esketamine nasal spray + AD versus placebo nasal spray + AD. Across the four studies, assessments were performed at 208 sites in 21 countries. Olfactory function was measured using the 40-item University of Pennsylvania Smell Identification Test (UPSIT(®)) and the single-staircase Snap & Sniff(®) Odor Detection Threshold Test (S&S-T). Nasal tolerability, including nasal examinations and a quantitative, self-administered nasal symptom questionnaire (NSQ), was also assessed. Data were analyzed using analyses of covariance. RESULTS: Of 1142 participants, 734 were women (64.3%). The mean age of all participants ranged from 45.7 to 70.0 years across the studies. Overall, 855 patients received esketamine nasal spray + AD and 432 received placebo nasal spray + AD. Objective evaluation of nasal function showed no evidence of an adverse impact following esketamine administration. Based on the UPSIT(®) and S&S-T results, intranasal administration of esketamine had no effect on the odor identification or threshold test scores compared with placebo nasal spray + oral AD. Similarly, repeated administration with esketamine nasal spray had no meaningful impact on assessments of nasal function. No dose-response relationship was observed between esketamine doses and the olfactory test scores. Esketamine nasal spray was well tolerated, as indicated by responses on the NSQ and negative nasal examination findings. CONCLUSION: Findings from this analysis indicate that there was no evidence of adverse effect on either olfactory or nasal health measures with repeated intermittent administration of esketamine nasal spray at any dose over the course of short-term (4 weeks) or long-term (16-100 weeks) studies.

"9607","1","[Topographic electroencephalometry following anesthesia induction with ketamine-midazolam].^\nThe neurophysiological action of ketamine has attracted increasing interest in recent years, with special interest in receptor action and in neurophysiological differences between and psychomimetic side effects of the two enantiomorphs. Most of the neurophysiological examinations published deal with ketamine as a single anaesthetic agent, although it has been suggested to that psychomimetic side-effects and haemodynamic deterioration could be avoided by combining ketamine with a sedative drug. The primary aim of our study was to examine the combined ketamine-midazolam action on cerebral activity; secondly, we planned to look at these interactions topographically at different points of the cortex to evaluate topographical differences in the combination's action; thirdly, the cerebral and haemodynamic reactions to anaesthesiological stimuli (intubation, gastric tube) were evaluated and compared. METHODS. Sixteen patients scheduled for elective aortocoronary bypass surgery were examined. Topographical electroencephalometric data were obtained by processed EEG with a CATEEM system at 17 recording points over the cortex and compared with heart rate and arterial blood pressure during the induction period. After documentation of the baseline data ketamine (3 mg/kg) and midazolam (0.15 mg/kg) were applied within 10 min by means of an automatic device. At the end of the infusion period patients were intubated, and after a further 10 min a gastric tube was placed. RESULTS. Induction resulted in increases in delta and beta 2 output (P < 0.05) in the early induction period and in significant decreases (P < 0.05) in alpha 1, alpha 2 and beta 1 activity. No significant change in theta activity was observed throughout the observation period. Intubation led to significant increases of power particularly in the temporal and parietal leads of all frequency bands, but not in the frontal area. Insertion of the gastric tube did not alter cerebral function. CONCLUSION. The interaction of ketamine and midazolam leads to increases in beta 2 and delta power and to significant decreases in the alpha bands and beta 1. Increases of theta activity, a typical effect of single-agent anaesthesia with ketamine, were not observed. Thus, the action of combined ketamine and midazolam on cerebral function is not an additive, but an interactive process. Despite a relatively high induction dosage, haemodynamic changes during intubation occurred and were accompanied by changes in cerebral activity. This can be regarded as incomplete cerebral suppression even by these induction dosages."
"3179","1","Psilocybin can occasion mystical-type experiences having substantial and sustained personal meaning and spiritual significance.^\nRATIONALE: Although psilocybin has been used for centuries for religious purposes, little is known scientifically about its acute and persisting effects. OBJECTIVES: This double-blind study evaluated the acute and longer-term psychological effects of a high dose of psilocybin relative to a comparison compound administered under comfortable, supportive conditions. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The participants were hallucinogen-naïve adults reporting regular participation in religious or spiritual activities. Two or three sessions were conducted at 2-month intervals. Thirty volunteers received orally administered psilocybin (30 mg/70 kg) and methylphenidate hydrochloride (40 mg/70 kg) in counterbalanced order. To obscure the study design, six additional volunteers received methylphenidate in the first two sessions and unblinded psilocybin in a third session. The 8-h sessions were conducted individually. Volunteers were encouraged to close their eyes and direct their attention inward. Study monitors rated volunteers' behavior during sessions. Volunteers completed questionnaires assessing drug effects and mystical experience immediately after and 2 months after sessions. Community observers rated changes in the volunteer's attitudes and behavior. RESULTS: Psilocybin produced a range of acute perceptual changes, subjective experiences, and labile moods including anxiety. Psilocybin also increased measures of mystical experience. At 2 months, the volunteers rated the psilocybin experience as having substantial personal meaning and spiritual significance and attributed to the experience sustained positive changes in attitudes and behavior consistent with changes rated by community observers. CONCLUSIONS: When administered under supportive conditions, psilocybin occasioned experiences similar to spontaneously occurring mystical experiences. The ability to occasion such experiences prospectively will allow rigorous scientific investigations of their causes and consequences."
"6566","1","How does ayahuasca work from a psychiatric perspective? Pros and cons of the entheogenic therapy.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ayahuasca is a hallucinogenic plant preparation, traditionally consumed in sacred ceremonies by indigenous North-Westerner Amazonian countries like Colombia, Peru, Brazil, and Ecuador. It is fundamental to carefully balance benefits/risks related to the ayahuasca intake, both during ceremonies and experimental settings. The aim is at evaluating and comparing the potential therapeutic benefits versus health risks related to ayahuasca intake (both acutely and chronically), focusing on its application in psychedelic psychiatry. DESIGN: A comprehensive mini overview focusing on psychiatric outcomes following ayahuasca intake both in healthy volunteers and in clinical samples. RESULTS: Preclinical, observational, and experimental studies in healthy volunteers as well as in clinical samples suggest that ayahuasca may be beneficial as an antidepressant, emotional regulator, anxiolytic, and antiaddictive drug, by exerting fast-acting and enduring clinical effects. Ayahuasca appears to be safe and well tolerated, nausea and emesis being the most reported and transient side effects. Some findings suggest not to use ayahuasca in bipolar or psychotic patients because of an increased risk of manic switch and/or psychotic onset. CONCLUSIONS: Further research should be carried out in randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials, by implementing neuroimaging studies, in order to better evaluate therapeutic potential of ayahuasca in mental disorders."
"4504","0","Association of Behavior With Noise-Induced Hearing Loss Among Attendees of an Outdoor Music Festival A Secondary Analysis of a Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nIMPORTANCE To date, factors associated with noise-induced hearing loss at music festivals have not yet been analyzed in a single comprehensive data set. In addition, little is known about the hearing loss-associated behavior of music festival attendees. OBJECTIVES To assess which factors are associated with the occurrence of a temporary threshold shift (TTS) after music exposure and to investigate the behavior of music festival attendees. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This prospective post hoc analysis gathered data from a randomized, single-blind clinical trial conducted on September 5, 2015, at an outdoor music festival in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. Adult volunteers with normal hearing were recruited via social media from August 26 through September 3, 2015. Intention to use earplugs was an exclusion criterion. Of 86 volunteers assessed, 51 were included. This post hoc analysis was performed from October 3, 2016, through February 27, 2017. INTERVENTIONS Music festival visit for 4.5 hours. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcomewas a TTS on a standard audiogram for the frequencies 3.0-and 4.0-kHz. Multivariable linear regression was performed to determine which factors are associated with a TTS. A questionnaire on behavior, hearing, and tinnitus was distributed to the participants before and after the festival visit. RESULTS A total of 51 participants were included (18 men [35%] and 33 women [65%]) with a mean (SD) age of 27 (6) years. Mean (SD) threshold change across 3.0 and 4.0 kHz was 5.4 (5.7) dB for the right ear and 4.0 (6.1) dB for the left ear. Earplug use (absolute difference in the left ear, -6.0 dB [95% CI, -8.7 to -3.2 dB]; in the right ear, -6.4 dB [95% CI, -8.8 to -4.1 dB]), quantity of alcohol use (absolute difference per unit in the left ear, 1.1 dB [95% CI, 0.5 to 1.7 dB]; in the right ear, 0.7 dB [95% CI, 0.1 to 1.4 dB]), drug use (absolute difference in the right ear, 6.0 dB [95% CI, 0.9 to 11.1 dB]), and male sex (absolute difference in the right ear, 4.1 dB [95% CI, 0.3 to 5.9 dB]) were independently associated with hearing loss, with earplug use being the most important factor. Unprotected participants reported significantly worse subjective hearing performance and tinnitus after the festival visit than did participants using earplugs (Cramer V, 0.62 [95% CI, 0.47-0.79] and 0.39 [95% CI, 0.16-0.62], respectively). In the earplug group, the perceived loudness (r = -0.72; 95% CI, -1.00 to -0.43) and appreciation (r = 0.53; 95% CI, 0.29 to 0.78) of music and speech perception (r = 0.21; 95% CI, 0.09 to 0.35) were correlated with the duration of earplug use. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The present study identified nonuse of earplugs, use of alcohol and drugs, and male sex as associated with a TTS at an outdoor music festival. Physicians should consider these factors to raise awareness about the combined risk of attending music festivals without using earplugs while consuming alcohol and/or drugs. The intention to use earplugs was correlated with the loudness and appreciation of music with earplugs, which may advocate for the use of personalized earplugs."
"9401","1","Polysubstance use and its correlates in adolescent ecstasy users in Taiwan.^\nThe aim of this study was to examine whether individual, family and peer factors can increase the risk of polysubstance use in Taiwanese adolescent ecstasy users. Two hundred adolescents with ecstasy use were recruited into this study. Their experience of using any other harmful substance in the preceding year and a variety of individual, family and peer characteristics were collected. The correlates of polysubstance use were examined using the two-step procedure of variable selection. The results indicated that 59 (29.5%) of the adolescent ecstasy users were polysubstance users. Ketamine, alcohol and areca quid were the three most prevalent substances used. Users who experienced dropping out of school, had poor mental health status and whose fathers had a low education level had an increased risk of polysubstance use. Clinicians should thoroughly screen adolescent ecstasy users who have the above factors as they are more likely to use other substances concomitantly. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."

"8750","0","Performance and cognitive alterations.^\nThe aim of this chapter is to provide an overview of the scientific research on the psychomotor and cognitive performance effects of commonly abused drugs. In an effort to encompass a wide range of psychomotor and cognitive functions, the following categories were selected: (1) sensory acuity, (2) motor ability, (3) attention, and (4) memory. Particular attention is focused on the effects of benzodiazepines, alcohol, opioids, and cannabis because of the relative breadth of research conducted on these compounds and because they are generally associated with cognitive decrements of potential clinical importance. The cognitive effects of psychomotor stimulants (e.g., amphetamines, cocaine, nicotine), MDMA ('Ecstasy'), ketamine, and hallucinogens are also briefly reviewed. In the interest of clarity, and to retain this text's focus on evidence-based, clinically relevant research, emphasis is placed on acute drug effects measured in controlled laboratory studies with healthy human volunteers. These qualities in research minimize the likelihood of invalid assumptions and ambiguity associated with generalizing effects across species. Also, although research on the long-term cognitive effects associated with chronic drug use (i.e., observational group comparison studies of substance abusers versus matched control participants) can provide clinically relevant information, and is discussed in brief, conclusions based on such studies are limited because they usually lack assessments of baseline function and rely on retrospective self-reports of drug use that are subject to error and recall bias. Furthermore, because substance abusers typically have histories of using more than one drug, comorbid psychiatric disorders, or central nervous system injury, it is difficult to confidently attribute the cause of any observed cognitive deficits to use of a single drug. Last, by focusing on studies conducted with healthy (nondrug-dependent) participants, potential effects of drug withdrawal on baseline assessments are eliminated. In addition to providing an overview of published data on the cognitive effects of abused drugs, brief comment is made regarding the relative severity of the acute effects observed for each drug class. Because the impairment caused by alcohol is generally considered significant, alcohol is used as a benchmark to provide comparative comment regarding the magnitude and clinical importance of the cognitive deficits described for other less familiar drugs.

This study evaluates the lifetime and current risk of substance dependence among lifetime substance users' among trauma inpatients and provides a relative ranking of addictive risk among the substances. Data on use of 8 substance groups (alcohol, opiates, marijuana, cocaine, other stimulants, sedative-hypnotics, hallucinogens, other drugs) were obtained by interview (Structured Clinical Interview for the DSM-III-R) from 1,118 adult trauma inpatients. Prevalence of lifetime dependence among lifetime users ranged from 80.7% for opiates and 70.9% for cocaine to 33.3% for hallucinogens and 26.6% for sedative-hypnotics. The rank order of addictive risk was similar to that found in the general population. Trauma inpatients had a higher absolute addictive risk than the general population, comparable to the risk found in patients in treatment for substance use disorders, suggesting the importance of screening trauma inpatients for substance dependence.

"8073","1","Surveying drug consumption: Assessing reliability and validity of the European Web Survey on Drugs questionnaire.^\nBackground: The European Web Survey on Drugs aimed to obtain in-depth data on consumption of cannabis, ecstasy/MDMA, cocaine, and amphetamines in different populations of drug users in 16 European countries. This paper examines test-retest reliability, the consistency and the comprehensibility of the prevalence and frequency of use questions in the Czech part of the survey. Methods: A baseline web survey was performed (N = 610) with follow-up data collection in a sub-sample of volunteers providing email addresses (N = 158). The baseline sample was self-selecting, responding to advertisements made available through multiple channels designed to attract diverse samples of drug users. Test-retest analysis was conducted for core questionnaire items. Results: Respondents to the follow-up were predominantly socially integrated; 91% reported last year cannabis use, 42% used Ecstasy/MDMA, 23% amphetamines, and 27% reported cocaine use. Test-retest reliability was rated moderate to good (reliability coefficients between 0.55–0.87) for most prevalence items with sufficient sample sizes. Items assessing frequency of use were more reliable for most substances when asking about the exact number of days used, compared to categorical items that implicitly assume a regular pattern of use and were interpreted differently by different respondents. Conclusions: Simplicity and unambiguity of questions increase the reliability of results. Tools measuring drug consumption need to take into consideration the irregularity of drug using patterns. Question testing is important to increase validity and support a correct interpretation of the data."
"9313","1","Discrete memory impairments in largely pure chronic users of MDMA.^\nChronic use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) has repeatedly been associated with deficits in working memory, declarative memory, and executive functions. However, previous findings regarding working memory and executive function are inconclusive yet, as in most studies concomitant stimulant use, which is known to affect these functions, was not adequately controlled for. Therefore, we compared the cognitive performance of 26 stimulant-free and largely pure (primary) MDMA users, 25 stimulant-using polydrug MDMA users, and 56 MDMA/stimulant-naïve controls by applying a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery. Neuropsychological tests were grouped into four cognitive domains. Recent drug use was objectively quantified by 6-month hair analyses on 17 substances and metabolites. Considerably lower mean hair concentrations of stimulants (amphetamine, methamphetamine, methylphenidate, cocaine), opioids (morphine, methadone, codeine), and hallucinogens (ketamine, 2C-B) were detected in primary compared to polydrug users, while both user groups did not differ in their MDMA hair concentration. Cohen's d effect sizes for both comparisons, i.e., primary MDMA users vs. controls and polydrug MDMA users vs. controls, were highest for declarative memory (dprimary=.90, dpolydrug=1.21), followed by working memory (dprimary=.52, dpolydrug=.96), executive functions (dprimary=.46, dpolydrug=.86), and attention (dprimary=.23, dpolydrug=.70). Thus, primary MDMA users showed strong and relatively discrete declarative memory impairments, whereas MDMA polydrug users displayed broad and unspecific cognitive impairments. Consequently, even largely pure chronic MDMA use is associated with decreased performance in declarative memory, while additional deficits in working memory and executive functions displayed by polydrug MDMA users are likely driven by stimulant co-use."
"3170","0","Investigation of the abuse liability of buspirone in alcohol-dependent patients.^\nBy use of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, the Single-Dose Questionnaire, and selected physiologic measures (blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, oral temperature, and pupil diameter), the abuse liability of buspirone (10, 20, and 40 mg) was compared with that of diazepam (10 and 20 mg) and placebo in 19 subjects who were hospitalized for the treatment of alcohol dependency. Each treatment was given as a single dose at intervals of at least three days according to a double-blind, six-period, crossover Latin square design. Neither buspirone nor diazepam had any effect on blood pressure, pulse and respiratory rates, or body temperature. A small, transient pupillary constriction was evident in the 20- and 40-mg buspirone groups, but it dissipated within two hours after dosing. Both buspirone and diazepam had only a small stimulating effect on appetite. On the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group and Sedation subscales of the Addiction Research Center Inventory, the 40-mg dose of buspirone yielded effects suggestive of a mild sedative-type drug. Only the 20-mg dose produced a significant effect on the Euphoria scale. Diazepam appeared to be more active as a sedative-hypnotic type of drug, by virtue of its effects on both the Amphetamine and Euphoria subscales and its greater effects on the Morphine-Benzedrine Group, Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, and Sedation subscales, suggesting euphoria. Not only does the lack of effect of buspirone on the Amphetamine and Morphine-Benzedrine Group subscales indicate lack of a euphorigenic property, but the score on the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide subscale, especially in the 40-mg group, suggests a dysphorigenic property at high doses. On the Amphetamine Self-Rating Scale, buspirone and diazepam affected only the sleep factor and only the 40-mg buspirone dose was distinguishable from placebo. On the Single-Dose Questionnaire, both buspirone and diazepam tended to be rated more as sedative-type drugs, but buspirone was generally less well liked than diazepam. Overall, the results, which suggest a lack of euphoria and the presence of dysphoria at high doses, indicate that buspirone has only limited, if any, abuse liability."
"6365","0","Biomarkers in mood disorders research: developing new and improved therapeutics.^\nBACKGROUND: Recently, surrogate neurobiological biomarkers that correlate with target engagement and therapeutic response have been developed and tested in early phase studies of mood disorders. OBJECTIVE: The identification of biomarkers could help develop personalized psychiatric treatments that may impact public health. METHODS: These biomarkers, which are associated with clinical response post-treatment, can be directly validated using multimodal approaches including genetic tools, proteomics/metabolomics, peripheral measures, neuroimaging, biostatistical predictors, and clinical predictors. RESULTS: To date, early phase biomarker studies have sought to identify measures that can serve as ""biosignatures"", or biological patterns of clinical response. These studies have also sought to identify clinical predictors and surrogate outcomes associated with pathophysiological domains consistently described in the National Institute of Mental Health's (NIMH) new Research Domain Criteria (RDoC). Using the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist ketamine as an example, we identified changes in several domains (clinical, cognitive, and neurophysiological) that predicted ketamine's rapid and sustained antidepressant effects in individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD) or bipolar depression. DISCUSSION: These approaches may ultimately provide clues into the neurobiology of psychiatric disorders and may have enormous impact Backon the development of novel therapeutics."
"5314","1","Amphetamine analogs methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) differentially affect speech.^\nRATIONALE: Most reports of the effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on speech have been anecdotal. OBJECTIVES: The current study used a within-participant design to assess the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA on speech. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eleven recreational users of amphetamines completed this inpatient, within-participant, double-blind study, during which they received placebo, methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), and MDMA (100 mg) on separate days. Following drug administration, study participants described movies viewed the previous evening and completed mood scales. RESULTS: Methamphetamine increased quantity of speech, fluency, and self-ratings of talkativeness and alertness, while it decreased the average duration of nonjuncture unfilled pauses. MDMA decreased fluency and increased self-ratings of inability to concentrate. To determine if methamphetamine- and MDMA-related effects were perceptible, undergraduates listened to the participants' movie descriptions and rated their coherence and the speaker's mood. Following methamphetamine, descriptions were judged to be more coherent and focused than they were following MDMA. CONCLUSIONS: Methamphetamine improved verbal fluency and MDMA adversely affected fluency. This pattern of effects is consistent with the effects of these drugs on functioning in other cognitive domains. In general, methamphetamine effects on speech were inconsistent with effects popularly attributed to this drug, while MDMA-related effects were in agreement with some anecdotal reports and discordant with others."

Automated speech analysis may represent a novel method to detect objective markers, which could help improve the characterization of these mental states. In this study, we employed computer-extracted speech features from multiple domains (acoustic, semantic, and psycholinguistic) to assess mental states after controlled administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and intranasal oxytocin. The training/validation set comprised within-participants data from 31 healthy adults who, over four sessions, were administered MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), oxytocin (20 IU), and placebo in randomized, double-blind fashion. Participants completed two 5-min speech tasks during peak drug effects. Analyses included group-level comparisons of drug conditions and estimation of classification at the individual level within this dataset and on two independent datasets. Promising classification results were obtained to detect drug conditions, achieving cross-validated accuracies of up to 87% in training/validation and 92% in the independent datasets, suggesting that the detected patterns of speech variability are associated with drug consumption. Specifically, we found that oxytocin seems to be mostly driven by changes in emotion and prosody, which are mainly captured by acoustic features. In contrast, mental states driven by MDMA consumption appear to manifest in multiple domains of speech. Furthermore, we find that the experimental task has an effect on the speech response within these mental states, which can be attributed to presence or absence of an interaction with another individual. These results represent a proof-of-concept application of the potential of speech to provide an objective measurement of mental states elicited during intoxication."
"6168","1","Effects of MDMA-like Substances in Healthy Subjects.^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used as recreational substance (Ecstasy), research tool to stimulate serotonin (5‐HT) and oxytocin release and study associated mood states, and as a potential therapeutic substance to enhance psychotherapy for post‐traumatic stress disorder. MDMA is an amphetamine derivative which, unlike prototypical amphetamines, predominantly enhances serotonergic neurotransmission via release of 5‐HT through the SERT and it less potently also releases dopamine and norepinephrine through the DA transporter and NE transporter, respectively. Furthermore, MDMA is known to trigger oxytocin release which may contribute to its effects to increase trust, prosociality, and enhance empathy. MDMA is therefore referred to as an ""entactogen"" or ""empathogen"". MDMA is currently the only empathogen investigated in substance‐assisted psychotherapy but other substances including the MDMA‐metabolite 3,4‐methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) have been used in the past or may be used in the future. Aim 1: MDA may exert greater perceptual psychedelic‐like effects due to a more potent binding to the serotonin 5‐HT2A receptor, and it may also act longer than MDMA partly due to a longer plasma half‐life. However, effects of MDMA and MDA have never been compared directly in the same study in humans and there is only one modern study that characterized MDA in humans. Therefore, the present study aims to describe and directly compare for the first time the effects of MDMA and MDA in the same healthy volunteers using modern and sensitive psychological and psychometric tests. Aim 2: Additionally, although amphetamines including MDMA and MDA induce mainly positive subjective effects they may also produce negative subjective drug effects including anxiety in particular at the onset of the subjective response and the rapid onset of euphoria may increase abuse liability. Additionally, blood pressure may increase rapidly at drug onset. A possible solution to mitigate anxiety, abuse‐related rapid euphoria increases and/or rapid blood pressure changes at onset consist of slowing the onset of the drug effect by using a slow‐release formulation of MDMA/MDA. Alternatively, amphetamines can be linked to the endogenous amino acid lysine forming inactive lysine‐amphetamine which then liberates the active amphetamine slowly in the circulation via plasma peptidases. This approach has been implemented with the medication Lisdexamfetamine, which combines lysine with d‐amphetamine. In the present study, the investigators will similarly characterize the effects of lysine‐MDMA and lysine‐MDA to test for attenuated effects across both substances in comparison with MDMA/MDA. Using a two‐factorial study design with four active substance conditions (MDMA vs. MDA and lysine‐MDMA vs. lysine‐MDA) the investigators will be able to test differences between MDMA and MDA (with and without lysine) as well as between lysinated a non‐lysinated substance (regardless of active substance) in the same study and with high statistical power and within one study addressing two aims."
"9282","1","5-HTTLPR genotype moderates the effects of past ecstasy use on verbal memory performance in adolescent and emerging adults: A pilot study.^\nObjective Ecstasy use is associated with memory deficits. Serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) polymorphisms have been linked with memory function in healthy samples. The present pilot study investigated the influence of 5-HTTLPR polymorphisms on memory performance in ecstasy users, marijuana-using controls, and non-drug-using controls, after a minimum of 7 days of abstinence. Method Data were collected from 116 young adults (18-25 years-old), including 45 controls, 42 marijuana users, and 29 ecstasy users, and were balanced for 5-HTTLPR genotype. Participants were abstinent seven days prior to completing memory testing. Three MANCOVAs and one ANCOVA were run to examine whether drug group, 5-HTTLPR genotype, and their interactions predicted verbal and visual memory after controlling for gender, past year alcohol use, other drug use, and nicotine cotinine levels. Results MANCOVA and ANCOVA analysis revealed a significant interaction between drug group and genotype (p = .03) such that ecstasy users with the L/L genotype performed significantly worse on CVLT-2 total recall (p = .05), short (p = .008) and long delay free recall (p = .01), and recognition (p = .006), with the reverse pattern found in controls. Ecstasy did not significantly predict visual memory. 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly predicted memory for faces (p = .02); short allele carriers performed better than those with L/L genotype. Conclusions 5-HTTLPR genotype moderated the effects of ecstasy on verbal memory, with L/L carriers performing worse compared to controls. Future research should continue to examine individual differences in ecstasy's impact on neurocognitive performance as well as relationships with neuronal structure. Additional screening and prevention efforts focused on adolescents and emerging adults are necessary to prevent ecstasy consumption."
"3296","1","Clarithromycin, a potent inhibitor of CYP3A, greatly increases exposure to oral S-ketamine.^\nBackground: Oral ketamine is used as an adjuvant in the treatment of refractory neuropathic and cancer-related pain. Drug interactions may alter the analgesic or other effects of ketamine. Aim and methods: The aim of the study was to investigate the effect of cytochrome P450 3A enzyme inhibition with clarithromycin on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of oral S-ketamine in a randomized controlled cross-over study with two phases. Ten healthy subjects were pre-treated with oral clarithromycin or placebo for 4 days. On day 4, they ingested an oral dose of 0.2 mg/kg of S-ketamine syrup. Plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were measured for 24 h. Analgesic effects were evaluated in a cold pressor test and psychomotor effects were followed for 12 h. Results: Clarithromycin increased the mean Cmax of ketamine by 3.6-fold (p < 0.001) and the mean AUC0–1 of ketamine by 2.6-fold (p = 0.001). The relative amount of the CYP3A dependent metabolite norketamine was decreased by 54% by clarithromycin (p = 0.004). Self-rated drug effect of S-ketamine was enhanced by clarithromycin (p < 0.05) but other behavioral effects or cold pain scores were not affected. Conclusions: Clarithromycin strongly increases plasma concentrations of oral S-ketamine probably by inhibiting its CYP3A-mediated N-demethylation. This increase is reflected as modest changes in behavioral effects of oral S-ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

Aims: To examine the prevalence rates and correlates of non-medical use of prescription stimulants (Ritalin, Dexedrine or Adderall) among US college students in terms of student and college characteristics. Design: A self-administered mail survey. Setting: One hundred and nineteen nationally representative 4-year colleges in the United States. Participants: A representative sample of 10 904 randomly selected college students in 2 001. Measurements: Self-reports of non-medical use of prescription stimulants and other substance use behaviors. Findings: The life-time prevalence of non-medical prescription stimulant use was 6.9%, past year prevalence was 4.1% and past month prevalence was 2.1%. Past year rates of non-medical use ranged from zero to 25% at individual colleges. Multivariate regression analyses indicated non-medical use was higher among college students who were male, white, members of fraternities and sororities and earned lower grade point averages. Rates were higher at colleges located in the north-eastern region of the US and colleges with more competitive admission standards. Non-medical prescription stimulant users were more likely to report use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, ecstasy, cocaine and other risky behaviors. Conclusions: The findings of the present study provide evidence that non-medical use of prescription stimulants is more prevalent among particular subgroups of US college students and types of colleges. The non-medical use of prescription stimulants represents a high-risk behavior that should be monitored further and intervention efforts are needed to curb this form of drug use.

"3112","1","Adjunctive Ketamine With Relapse Prevention-Based Psychological Therapy in the Treatment of Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Early evidence suggests that ketamine may be an effective treatment to sustain abstinence from alcohol. The authors investigated the safety and efficacy of ketamine compared with placebo in increasing abstinence in patients with alcohol use disorder. An additional aim was to pilot ketamine combined with mindfulness-based relapse prevention therapy compared with ketamine and alcohol education as a therapy control. METHODS: In a double-blind placebo-controlled phase 2 clinical trial, 96 patients with severe alcohol use disorder were randomly assigned to one of four conditions: 1) three weekly ketamine infusions (0.8 mg/kg i.v. over 40 minutes) plus psychological therapy, 2) three saline infusions plus psychological therapy, 3) three ketamine infusions plus alcohol education, or 4) three saline infusions plus alcohol education. The primary outcomes were self-reported percentage of days abstinent and confirmed alcohol relapse at 6-month follow-up. RESULTS: Ninety-six participants (35 women; mean age, 44.07 years [SD=10.59]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis. The treatment was well tolerated, and no serious adverse events were associated with the study drug. Although confidence intervals were wide, consistent with a proof-of-concept study, there were a significantly greater number of days abstinent from alcohol in the ketamine group compared with the placebo group at 6-month follow-up (mean difference=10.1%, 95% CI=1.1, 19.0), with the greatest reduction in the ketamine plus therapy group compared with the saline plus education group (15.9%, 95% CI=3.8, 28.1). There was no significant difference in relapse rate between the ketamine and placebo groups. CONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated that treatment with three infusions of ketamine was well tolerated in patients with alcohol use disorder and was associated with more days of abstinence from alcohol at 6-month follow-up. The findings suggest a possible beneficial effect of adding psychological therapy alongside ketamine treatment."
"5385","0","Five-year monitoring of 19 illicit and legal substances of abuse at the inlet of a wastewater treatment plant in Barcelona (NE Spain) and estimation of drug consumption patterns and trends.^\nIllicit and legal drugs of abuse, including alcohol, continue to be in the focus of many governmental national and international studies due to the important consequences of their consumption at both individual and social level. Estimation of drug use at the community level from the concentrations of the drugs themselves or their major metabolites measured in wastewater has become an increasingly accepted and extended tool, complementary to the methods traditionally used for this purpose. The present work describes the application of this approach, generally known as wastewater epidemiology, to investigate the latest drug consumption patterns and trends in the European city of Barcelona. To this end, a total of 19 selected drugs of abuse and metabolites were monitored at the inlet of one of the main wastewater treatment plants of Barcelona every day during one week in March between 2011 and 2015. Analysis of the selected drugs and metabolites in the wastewater samples was performed by means of two methodologies based on liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and the concentrations obtained were translated into consumption data. In agreement with official records, alcohol, followed by cannabis, cocaine, amphetamine-like compounds, and methadone were the most consumed drugs. Alcohol, cannabis, and cocaine consumption were on average 18 mL(14 g)/day/inhabitant (> 15), 38 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, and 2.4 g/day/1000 inhabitants aging 15–64, respectively. As for drug use trends, consumption increased over the 5 years monitored for all drugs, but for heroin and diazepam. Weekly profiles characterized by higher consumption over the weekend as compared to weekdays were observed only for alcohol, cocaine, and MDMA. Extrapolation of the data obtained for the area under study to the national Spanish territory yields consumption figures of 142 t of illicit drugs per year and > 2500 million euro turnover per year in the black market."
"5285","0","Enhancing Psychological Interventions for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) Treatment with Memory Influencing Drugs.^\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic psychiatric disease resulting from the experience or witnessing of traumatic events. Persistent PTSD symptoms impair patients’ daily quality of life, jeopardizing sleep, mood, sociability, and arousal. Recommended psychological or pharmacological interventions are effective only in a small portion of patients and often lead to relapse. Thus, there is a critical need to address a lack of advancement in the treatment of PTSD. The combination of psychological interventions, aimed at facilitating the extinction of the traumatic memory, and pharmacological medications, represents a promising tool for PTSD treatment. Timely use of psychotherapy in conjunction with pharmacological treatments, rather than monotherapy, could thus determine a syn-ergistic effect by potentiating the effects of psychological interventions. In such a scenario, drugs that modulate cognitive processes involved in the development and/or persistence of post-traumatic symp-tomatology could be of great help to improve the outcome of psychotherapies and patients' prognosis. The purpose of the present article is to review the current data available from clinical trials on combined pharmacological treatments with psychological interventions in PTSD therapy. An overview of findings from animal studies that prompted clinical research is also discussed."
"5018","0","A randomized controlled trial of buprenorphine in the management of short-term ambulatory heroin withdrawal.^\nAIM: To determine whether buprenorphine is more effective than clonidine and other symptomatic medications in managing ambulatory heroin withdrawal. DESIGN: Open label, prospective randomized controlled trial examining withdrawal and 4‐week postwithdrawal outcomes on intention‐to‐treat. SETTING: Two specialist, out‐patient drug treatment centres in inner city Melbourne and Sydney, Australia. PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and fourteen dependent heroin users were recruited. Participants were 18 years or over, and with no significant other drug dependence, medical or psychiatric conditions or recent methadone treatment. One hundred and one (89%) participants completed a day 8 research interview examining withdrawal outcomes, and 92 (81%) completed day 35 research interview examining postwithdrawal outcomes. INTERVENTIONS: Participants randomized to control (n = 56) (up to 8 days of clonidine and other symptomatic medications) or experimental (n = 58) (up to 5 days of buprenorphine) withdrawal groups. Following the 8‐day withdrawal episode, participants could self‐select from range of postwithdrawal options (naltrexone, substitution maintenance, or counselling). MEASUREMENTS: Retention in withdrawal; heroin use during withdrawal; and retention in drug treatment 4 weeks after withdrawal. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: Withdrawal severity; adverse events, and heroin use in the postwithdrawal period. FINDINGS: The experimental group had better treatment retention at day 8 (86% versus 57%, P = 0.001, 95% CI for numbers needed to treat (NNT) = 3‐8) and day 35 (62% versus 39%, P = 0.02, 95% CI for NNT = 4‐18); used heroin on fewer days during the withdrawal programme (2.6 +/‐ 2.5 versus 4.5 +/‐ 2.3, P < 0.001, 95% CI = 1‐2.5 days) and in the postwithdrawal period (9.0 +/‐ 8.2 versus 14.6 +/‐ 10, P < 0.01, 95% CI = 1.8‐9.4); and reported less withdrawal severity. No severe adverse events reported. CONCLUSIONS: Buprenorphine is effective for short‐term ambulatory heroin withdrawal, with greater retention, less heroin use and less withdrawal discomfort during withdrawal; and increased postwithdrawal treatment retention than symptomatic medications."
"1088","0","Long-term increase in sensitivity to ketamine's behavioral effects in mice exposed to mild blast induced traumatic brain injury.^\nNeurobehavioral deficits emerge in nearly 50% of patients following a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI) and may persist for months. Ketamine is used frequently as an anesthetic/analgesic and for management of persistent psychiatric complications. Although ketamine may produce beneficial effects in patients with a history of TBI, differential sensitivity to its impairing effects could make the therapeutic use of ketamine in TBI patients unsafe. This series of studies examined male C57BL/6 J mice exposed to a mild single blast overpressure (mbTBI) for indications of altered sensitivity to ketamine at varying times after injury. Dystaxia (altered gait), diminished sensorimotor gating (reduced prepulse inhibition) and impaired working memory (step-down inhibitory avoidance) were examined in mbTBI and sham animals 15 min following intraperitoneal injections of saline or R, S-ketamine hydrochloride, from day 7-16 post injury and again from day 35-43 post injury. Behavioral performance in the forced swim test and sucrose preference test were evaluated on day 28 and day 74 post injury respectively, 24 h following drug administration. Dynamic gait stability was compromised in mbTBI mice on day 7 and 35 post injury and further exacerbated following ketamine administration. On day 14 and 42 post injury, prepulse inhibition was robustly decreased by mbTBI, which ketamine further reduced. Ketamine-associated memory impairment was apparent selectively in mbTBI animals 1 h, 24 h and day 28 post shock (tested on day 15/16/43 post injury). Ketamine selectively reduced immobility scores in the FST in mbTBI animals (day 28) and reversed mbTBI induced decreases in sucrose consumption (Day 74). These results demonstrate increased sensitivity to ketamine in mice when tested for extended periods after TBI. The results suggest that ketamine may be effective for treating neuropsychiatric complications that emerge after TBI but urge caution when used in clinical practice for enhanced sensitivity to its side effects in this patient population."
"9195","1","Attenuation of Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine by Opioid Receptor Antagonism.^\nOBJECTIVE: In addition to N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonism, ketamine produces opioid system activation. The objective of this study was to determine whether opioid receptor antagonism prior to administration of intravenous ketamine attenuates its acute antidepressant or dissociative effects. METHOD: In a proposed double-blind crossover study of 30 adults with treatment-resistant depression, the authors performed a planned interim analysis after studying 14 participants, 12 of whom completed both conditions in randomized order: placebo or 50 mg of naltrexone preceding intravenous infusion of 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine. Response was defined as a reduction ≥50% in score on the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) score on postinfusion day 1. RESULTS: In the interim analysis, seven of 12 adults with treatment-resistant depression met the response criterion during the ketamine plus placebo condition. Reductions in 6-item and 17-item HAM-D scores among participants in the ketamine plus naltrexone condition were significantly lower than those of participants in the ketamine plus placebo condition on postinfusion days 1 and 3. Secondary analysis of all participants who completed the placebo and naltrexone conditions, regardless of the robustness of response to ketamine, showed similar results. There were no differences in ketamine-induced dissociation between conditions. Because naltrexone dramatically blocked the antidepressant but not the dissociative effects of ketamine, the trial was halted at the interim analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The findings suggest that ketamine's acute antidepressant effect requires opioid system activation. The dissociative effects of ketamine are not mediated by the opioid system, and they do not appear sufficient without the opioid effect to produce the acute antidepressant effects of ketamine in adults with treatment-resistant depression."
"6062","1","Intrathecal Ketamine, Dexmedetomidine and Both With Bupivacaine for Postoperative Abdominal Cancer Surgery Pain.^\nThis study was approved by the ethics committee of South Egypt Cancer Institute, Assiut University, Assiut, Egypt. After obtaining a written informed consent, 90 American Society of Anesthesia (ASA) I‐II patients aged 30‐50 years and scheduled for major abdominal cancer surgery were included in the study. Patients with a known allergy to the study drugs, significant cardiac, respiratory, renal or hepatic disease, coagulation disorder, infection at the site of intrathecal injection, drug or alcohol abuse, BMI > 30 kg/m2 , and psychiatric illnesses that would interfere with perception and assessment of pain were excluded from the study. Preoperatively, patients were taught how to evaluate their own pain intensity using the visual analogue scale (VAS), scored from 0 ‐10 (where 0 = no pain, and 10 = the worst pain imaginable). Oral diazepam (5 mg) was taken the night before surgery. Up on arrival at the operative theatre, a 16‐gauge catheter was introduced intravenously at the dorsum of the hand; lactated Ringer's solution 10 mg/kg was infused intravenously over 10 min. before initiation of spinal anesthesia. Basic monitoring probes (electrocardiography, non invasive blood pressure, O2 saturation, and temperature) were applied. Patients were placed in the setting position and a 25‐gauge Quincke needle was placed in the L2‐3 or L3‐4 interspaces. Patients were randomly divided, by selecting sealed envelopes into one of three groups 30 patients each: ‐ The dexmedetomidine group (group I) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. ‐ The ketamine group (group II) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 0.1 mg/kg ketamine in 1ml volume intrathecally. ‐ Dexmedetomidine + Ketamine group (group III) received 10 mg of hyperbaric bupivacaine 0.5% in 2 ml volume and 5µg of dexmedetomidine plus 0.1 mg/kg of Ketamine in 1 ml volume intrathecally. Immediately after their intrathecal injection, the patients were placed in the supine position. After successful spinal anesthesia, general anesthesia was induced with fentanyl 1.5‐2 µg/kg, propofol 2‐3 mg/kg, and lidocaine 1.5 mg/kg. Endotracheal intubation was facilitated by cis‐atracurium 0.15 mg/kg. Heart rate, systolic, and diastolic blood pressure were recorded at 5, 10, 20, 30, 60, 120, 180 minutes. Anesthesia and muscle relaxation were maintained by isoflurane 1‐ 1.5 MAC in 50% oxygen/air mixture and cis‐atracurium 0.03 mg/kg bolus given every 30 min. respectively. At the end of surgery, muscle relaxation was reversed by neostigmine 50 µg/kg and atropine 20 µg/kg. Patients were extubated and transferred to postanesthesia care unit (PACU) and were monitored for vital signs (heart rate, non invasive blood pressure, respiratory rate, and O2 saturation) immediately postoperative and at 2, 4, 6, 12, 18, and 24 hours postoperative. VAS scores were assessed at the same time points. Rescue analgesia represented by patient‐controlled analgesia (PCA) with intravenous morphine with an initial bolus of 0.1 mg/kg once pain was expressed by the patient, or if VAS was 3 or more (VAS ≥ 3) followed by 1 mg boluses with a lockout period of 5 min. The time of first request of analgesia and total analgesic consumption in the first 24 hours postoperatively were recorded. The patient's level of sedation was assessed at the same time points using a modified Observer's Assessment of alertness/sedation (OAAS) scale (where 6 = agitated, and 0 = doesn't respond to deep stimuls). The attendant anesthesiologist, the patient‐care giver, and the data collection personnel were all blinded to patient assignment to a specific group. Postoperative adverse effects such as nausea, vomiting, hypotension, bradycardia, cardiac arrhythmias were recorded and treated. Hypotension was defined as a 15% decrease in systolic blood pressure from baseline. Bradycardia was defined as a heart rate slower than 50 beats per minute or a decrease in heart rate of 20% or more from baseline; whichev r is lowest. Hypoxia was defined as an oxygen saturation of less than 90%. Hypotension was treated with intravenous boluse of ephidrine 0.1 mg/kg and normal saline 5ml/kg; the same doses were repeated as required. Bradycardia was treated with intravenous atropine 0.01 mg/kg."
"4164","0","The prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA): Controlled studies in humans and laboratory animals.^\nUsers of ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') report prosocial effects such as sociability and empathy. Supporting these apparently unique social effects, data from controlled laboratory studies indicate that MDMA alters social feelings, information processing, and behavior in humans, and social behavior in rodents. Here, we review this growing body of evidence. In rodents, MDMA increases passive prosocial behavior (adjacent lying) and social reward while decreasing aggression, effects that may involve serotonin 1A receptor mediated oxytocin release interacting with vasopressin receptor 1A. In humans, MDMA increases plasma oxytocin and produces feelings of social affiliation. It decreases identification of negative facial expressions (cognitive empathy) and blunts responses to social rejection, while enhancing responses to others' positive emotions (emotional empathy) and increasing social approach. Thus, consistent with drug folklore, laboratory administration of MDMA robustly alters social processing in humans and increases social approach in humans and animals. Effects are consistent with increased sociability, with mixed evidence about enhanced empathy. These neurobiologically-complex prosocial effects likely motivate recreational ecstasy use."

The usual psychomimetic effect associated with ketamine administration was observed in only one patient. Further experience of total intravenous ketamine anaesthesia with adjunctive use of fentanyl to attenuate cardiovascular effects and midazolam for the pyschomimetic effect can further refine the technique. Cerebral function monitoring, if possible, will allow correlation of depth of anaesthesia with drug dosage and can ensure appropriate anaesthetic depth and recovery."
"8918","1","Impaired executive function in male MDMA (""ecstasy"") users.^\nRationale: Long-term users of ecstasy have shown impaired performance on a multitude of cognitive abilities (most notably memory, attention, executive function). Research into the pattern of MDMA effects on executive functions remains fragmented, however. Objectives: To determine more systematically what aspects of executive function are affected by a history of MDMA use, by using a model that divides executive functions into cognitive flexibility, information updating and monitoring, and inhibition of pre-potent responses. Methods: MDMA users and controls who abstained from ecstasy and other substances for at least 2 weeks were tested with a computerized cognitive test battery to assess their abilities on tasks that measure the three submodalities of executive function, and their combined contribution on two more complex executive tasks. Because of sex-differential effects of MDMA reported in the literature, data from males and females were analyzed separately. Results: Male MDMA users performed significantly worse on the tasks that tap on cognitive flexibility and on the combined executive function tasks; no differences were found on the other cognitive tasks. Female users showed no impairments on any of the tasks. Conclusions: The present data suggest that a history of MDMA use selectively impairs executive function. In male users, cognitive flexibility was impaired and increased perseverative behavior was observed. The inability to adjust behavior rapidly and flexibly may have repercussions for daily life activities."

"8604","0","The neurobehavioral pharmacology of ketamine: implications for drug abuse, addiction, and psychiatric disorders.^\nKetamine was developed in the early 1960s as an anesthetic and has been used for medical and veterinary procedures since then. Its unique profile of effects has led to its use at subanesthetic doses for a variety of other purposes: it is an effective analgesic and can prevent certain types of pathological pain; it produces schizophrenia-like effects and so is used in both clinical studies and preclinical animal models to better understand this disorder; it has rapid-acting and long-lasting antidepressant effects; and it is popular as a drug of abuse both among young people at dance parties and raves and among spiritual seekers. In this article we summarize recent research that provides insight into the myriad uses of ketamine. Clinical research is discussed, but the focus is on preclinical animal research, including recent findings from our own laboratory. Of particular note, although ketamine is normally considered a locomotor stimulant at subanesthetic doses, we have found locomotor depressant effects at very low subanesthetic doses. Thus, rather than a monotonic dose-dependent increase in activity, ketamine produces a more complex dose response. Additional work explores the mechanism of action of ketamine, ketamine-induced neuroadaptations, and ketamine reward. The findings described will inform future research on ketamine and lead to a better understanding of both its clinical uses and its abuse."
"4356","1","MDMA: a social drug in a social context.^\nRATIONALE: The drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy,"" ""molly"") is thought to produce prosocial effects and enhance social interaction. However, in most laboratory studies to date, the participants have been tested under nonsocial conditions, which may not simulate the effects the drug produces in more naturalistic social settings. METHODS: Healthy experienced MDMA users participated in three laboratory sessions in which they received MDMA (0.5 or 1.0 mg/kg or placebo, double blind). They were randomly assigned to one of three social conditions, in which they were tested alone (solitary (SOL); N = 10), in the presence of a research assistant (research assistant present (RAP); N = 11) or in the presence of another participant who also received the drug (other participant present (OPP); N = 11). RESULTS: As expected, MDMA increased heart rate and blood pressure and produced positive subjective effects in all the three groups. It also increased ratings of attractiveness of another person and increased social interaction in RAP and OPP. The social context affected certain responses to the drug. The effects of MDMA were greater in the OPP condition, compared to the SOL or RAP conditions, on measures of ""feel drug,"" ""dizzy,"" and on cardiovascular. But responses to the drug on other measures, including social behavior, did not differ across the conditions. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide some support for the idea that drugs produce greater effects when they are used in the presence of other drug users. However, the influence of the social context was modest, and it remains to be determined whether other variables related to social context would substantially alter the effects of MDMA or other drugs."

"7029","0","Meta-analysis of depressive symptoms in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia.^\nSubstance abuse is highly prevalent in schizophrenia and associated with numerous negative consequences. While studies have regularly reported more severe depressive symptoms in addicted schizophrenia patients relative to non-abusing patients, some studies have not corroborated this finding. The current meta-analysis was performed to quantify the relative severity of depressive symptoms in dual-diagnosis schizophrenia. A search of the literature using computerized engines was undertaken. Studies were retained in the analysis if (i) they assessed depressive symptoms using validated scales specific to depression (e.g. Hamilton Depression Rating Scale); and (ii) groups of schizophrenia patients were divided according to substance use disorders (alcohol, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, heroin and/or phencyclidine). According to the inclusion criteria, 20 studies were available for mathematical analysis. A small, positive and significant effect size estimate (n =3283; 1680 dual diagnosis; 1603 single diagnosis; adjusted Hedges's g =0.292; p =0.003) was obtained, within a random-effect model, suggesting that some dual-diagnosis patients experience more severe depressive symptoms than single-diagnosis patients. This significant difference was found only for studies using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale but not for other depression scales. The results of the present meta-analysis suggest that addicted schizophrenia patients experience more severe depressive symptoms compared to non-abusing patients, but that the difference is smaller than commonly assumed. The meta-analysis also shows that the significance of results is related to the scale used to measure depressive symptoms. These results have methodological implications for future studies of depressive symptoms in dual-diagnosis patients, and potential implications for the prevention and treatment of depressive symptoms in schizophrenia."
"121","1","Comprehensive assessment of side effects associated with a single dose of ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Concerns about ketamine for treating depression include abuse potential and the occurrence of psychotomimetic effects. This study sought to comprehensively assess side effects (SEs) associated with a single subanesthetic-dose intravenous ketamine infusion. A secondary aim was to examine the relationship between Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) scores and dissociative symptoms reported on a comprehensive, clinician-administered SE questionnaire. METHODS: Data from 188 participants were pooled from four placebo-controlled, crossover ketamine trials and one open-label study (n = 163 with either treatment-resistant major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder and 25 healthy controls). SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion and monitored over the time-course of each study. Statistical analyses assessed the effect of drug (ketamine, placebo) on SEs and measured the relationship between CADSS total score and SEs contemporaneously endorsed during structured interviews. RESULTS: Forty-four of 120 SEs occurred in at least 5% of participants over all trials. Thirty-three of these 44 SEs were significantly associated with active drug administration (versus placebo). The most common SE was feeling strange/weird/loopy. Most SEs peaked within an hour of ketamine administration and resolved completely by two hours post-infusion. No serious drug-related adverse events or increased ketamine craving/abuse post-administration were observed. A positive correlation was found between dissociative SEs and total CADSS score. LIMITATIONS: The post-hoc nature of the analysis; the limited generalizability of a single subanesthetic-dose ketamine infusion; and the lack of formal measures to assess ketamine's cognitive, urological, or addictive potential. CONCLUSIONS: No long-lasting significant SEs occurred over the approximately three-month follow-up period."
"969","0","Prohedonic properties of gamma-hydroxybutyrate are associated with changes in limbic resting-state functional connectivity.^\nOBJECTIVE: Gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB) is an endogenous GHB-/GABA-B receptor agonist and a narcolepsy treatment. However, GHB is also abused for its prohedonic effects. On a neuronal level, it was shown that GHB increases regional cerebral blood flow in limbic areas such as the right anterior insula (rAI) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC). We aimed to further explore the association between the subjective and neuronal signatures of GHB. METHOD: We assessed subjective effects and resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) of an rAI- and an ACC-seed in 19 healthy male subjects after GHB (35 mg/kg p.o.) using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized, cross-over functional magnet resonance imaging design. RESULTS: GHB increased subjective ratings for euphoria (p < 0.001) and sexual arousal (p < 0.01). Moreover, GHB increased rAI-rsFC to the right thalamus and the superior frontal gyrus and decreased ACC-rsFC to the bilateral paracentral lobule (all p < 0.05, cluster corrected). Moreover, GHB-induced euphoria was associated with rAI-rsFC to the superior frontal gyrus (p < 0.05, uncorrected). CONCLUSIONS: GHB induces prohedonic effects such as euphoria and sexual arousal and in parallel modulates limbic rsFC with areas linked to regulation of mood, cognitive control, and sexual experience. These results further elucidate the drug's effects in neuropsychiatric disorders and as drug of abuse."

"4880","0","Enhancing recovery in early schizophrenia - A controlled clinical trial investigating cannabidiol CR vs. placebo as an add-on to antipsychotic treatment.^\nCurrent antipsychotic treatments of schizophrenia are only partially effective, and their use is often associated with serious side effects. Cannabidiol is a natural counterpart of the psychoactive component of marijuana, delta‐9‐tetrahydrocannabinol and has no psychotomimetic or addictive properties. In a controlled clinical trial of cannabidiol versus amisulpride in acute paranoid schizophrenia we showed a statistically significant clinical improvement in all symptoms clusters of schizophrenia compared to baseline with either treatment. Cannabidiol displayed a significantly superior side‐effect profile in particular regarding prolactin elevation, extrapyramidal symptoms and weight gain. The favorable side‐effect profile and potentially novel mechanism of action identify this molecule as a potential antipsychotic. However, long‐term safety and efficacy data is still lacking. This study in 180 remitted schizophrenia patients is to evaluate the effi‐ cacy and safety of the novel compound cannabidiol in the maintenance treatment of schizophrenia in comparison to placebo as an add‐on to an established treatment with either olanzapine or amisulpride, in a 12 months, double‐blind, parallel‐group, randomized, placebo‐controlled clinical trial. Thereby, relevant data on cannabidiol's antipsychotic potential will be gained."
"8732","1","Sub-acute and long-term effects of ayahuasca on mental health and well-being in healthy ceremony attendants: A replication study.^\nBackground and aims: There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that the psychedelic plant tea, ayahuasca, holds therapeutic potential. Uthaug et al. (2018) demonstrated that a single dose of ayahuasca improved mental health sub-acutely and 4-weeks post-ceremony in healthy participants. The present study aimed to replicate and extend these findings. A first objective was to assess the sub-acute and longterm effects of ayahuasca on mental health and well-being in first-time and experienced users. A second aim was to extend the assessment of altered states of consciousness and how they relate to changes in mental health. Method: Ayahuasca ceremony attendants (N = 5 73) were assessed before, the day after, and four weeks following the ceremony. Results: We replicated the reduction in self-reported stress 4-weeks post ceremony, but, in contrast, found no reduction in depression. Also, increased satisfaction with life and awareness the day after the ceremony, and its return to baseline 4 weeks later, were replicated. New findings were: reduced ratings of anxiety and somatization, and increased levels of non-judging 4-weeks post-ceremony. We replicated the relation between altered states of consciousness (e.g., experienced ego dissolution during the ceremony) and mental health outcomes sub-acutely. The effects of ayahuasca did not differ between experienced and first-time users. Conclusion: Partly in line with previous findings, ayahuasca produces long-term improvements in affect in non-clinical users. Furthermore, sub-acute mental health ratings are related to the intensity of the psychedelic experience. Although findings replicate and highlight the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, this needs to be confirmed in placebo-controlled studies.

"1139","1","Ketamine-induced changes in resting state connectivity, 2 h after the drug administration in patients with remitted depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Resting state connectivity studies link ketamine's antidepressant effects with normalisation of the brain connectivity changes that are observed in depression. These changes, however, usually co-occur with improvement in depressive symptoms, making it difficult to attribute these changes to ketamine's effects per se. AIMS: Our aim is to examine the effects of ketamine in brain connectivity, 2 h after its administration in a cohort of volunteers with remitted depression. Any significant changes observed in this study could provide insight of ketamine's antidepressant mechanism as they are not accompanied by symptom changes. METHODS: In total, 35 participants with remitted depression (21 females, mean age = 28.5 years) participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled study of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) or saline. Resting state scans were acquired approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion. Brain connectivity was examined using a seed-based approach (ventral striatum, amygdala, hippocampus, posterior cingulate cortex and subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sgACC)) and a brain network analysis (independent component analysis). RESULTS: Decreased connectivity between the sgACC and the amygdala was observed approximately 2 h after the ketamine infusion, compared to placebo (p(FWE) < 0.05). The executive network presented with altered connectivity with different cortical and subcortical regions. Within the network, the left hippocampus and right amygdala had decreased connectivity (p(FWE) < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support a model whereby ketamine would change the connectivity of brain areas and networks that are important for cognitive processing and emotional regulation. These changes could also be an indirect indicator of the plasticity changes induced by the drug."

To create an evidenced-based point of view for patients and physicians, we performed a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCT) on the use of cannabinoids in MD. The seven RCTs found on PD used different cannabis formulations. No improvement of motor symptoms was shown in any of the two RCTs with this as primary outcome (PO), but in the nabilone group, an improvement in quality of life was documented. Of the three RCTs having levodopa-induced dyskinesia as PO, only one using nabilone showed a reduction. Anxiety and anxiety-induced tremor could be reduced in the cannabidiol group as well as anxiety and sleeping problems in the nabilone group in another RCT. In two RCTs with Tourette syndrome, an improvement in tics was revealed. From three RCTs on Huntington's disease only one found symptoms relief using nabilone. No reduction of dystonia could be shown in the two included RCTs. The limited number of available but small and inhomogeneous RCTs precludes reliable conclusions. Therefore, more and smartly designed RCTs are urgently needed."
"4440","0","Ketamine-50 years in use: from anesthesia to rapid antidepressant effects and neurobiological mechanisms.^\nOver the past 50 years, ketamine has solidified its position in both human and veterinary medicine as an important anesthetic with many uses. More recently, ketamine has been studied and used for several new indications, ranging from chronic pain to drug addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder. The discovery of the rapid-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine has resulted in a surge of interest towards understanding the precise mechanisms driving its effects. Indeed, ketamine may have had the largest impact for advancements in the research and treatment of psychiatric disorders in the past few decades. While intense research efforts have been aimed towards uncovering the molecular targets underlying ketamine's effects in treating depression, the underlying neurobiological mechanisms remain elusive. These efforts are made more difficult by ketamine's complex dose-dependent effects on molecular mechanisms, multiple pharmacologically active metabolites, and a mechanism of action associated with the facilitation of synaptic plasticity. This review aims to provide a brief overview of the different uses of ketamine, with an emphasis on examining ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects spanning molecular, cellular, and network levels. Another focus of the review is to offer a perspective on studies related to the different doses of ketamine used in antidepressant research. Finally, the review discusses some of the latest hypotheses concerning ketamine's action."

Using the data from two similar large national surveys run in 1993 and 2002, this paper assesses secular trends in rates of substance use among 16-20-year-old Swiss adolescents. Methods: Self-reported regular use of tobacco, alcohol misuse, regular cannabis use (≥1 occasion over last 30 days) and lifetime use of psychoactive medication, LSD, ecstasy, cocaine and heroine were assessed through identical questions using an anonymous self-administered questionnaire. 9268 (1993) and 7428 (2002) high school students and apprentices were included in the analyses. Results: There is a higher proportion of regular smokers among apprentices than among students (p <0.001). Between 1993 and 2002 the increase in regular tobacco consumption was significant among both female and male apprentices (p <0.001) but not among students. Between 1993 and 2002 alcohol misuse significantly increased in all four groups (p <0.001). It is more prevalent among males than among females (p <0.001) and higher among apprentices than among students (p <0.001). Regular use of cannabis has increased in the four groups (p <0.0001). It is higher among males than among females (p <0.001), while it is largely the same among students and apprentices. While the increase in ecstasy use is highly significant in all four groups (p <0.001), the increase in LSD and cocaine use is significant among apprentices only (p <0.001). Use of LSD, ecstasy and cocaine is more prevalent among males than among females (<0.001) and higher among apprentices than among students (p <0.001). Conclusion: The secular increase in psychoactive substance use among older Swiss adolescents calls for the implementation of effective strategies both from individual and public health viewpoints."
"3547","0","Mechanisms of ketamine and its metabolites as antidepressants.^\nTreating major depression is a medical need that remains unmet by monoaminergic therapeutic strategies that commonly fail to achieve symptom remission. A breakthrough in the treatment of depression was the discovery that the anesthetic (R,S)-ketamine (ketamine), when administered at sub-anesthetic doses, elicits rapid (sometimes within hours) antidepressant effects in humans that are otherwise resistant to monoaminergic-acting therapies. While this finding was revolutionary and led to the FDA approval of (S)-ketamine (esketamine) for use in adults with treatment-resistant depression and suicidal ideation, the mechanisms underlying how ketamine or esketamine elicit their effects are still under active investigation. An emerging view is that metabolism of ketamine may be a crucial step in its mechanism of action, as several metabolites of ketamine have neuroactive effects of their own and may be leveraged as therapeutics. For example, (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine (HNK), is readily observed in humans following ketamine treatment and has shown therapeutic potential in preclinical tests of antidepressant efficacy and synaptic potentiation while being devoid of the negative adverse effects of ketamine, including its dissociative properties and abuse potential. We discuss preclinical and clinical studies pertaining to how ketamine and its metabolites produce antidepressant effects. Specifically, we explore effects on glutamate neurotransmission through N-methyl D-aspartate receptors (NMDARs) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid receptors (AMPARs), synaptic structural changes via brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signaling, interactions with opioid receptors, and the enhancement of serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine signaling. Strategic targeting of these mechanisms may result in novel rapid-acting antidepressants with fewer undesirable side effects compared to ketamine."

Nerve damage and central sensitization involving NDMDAr activation may play an important role. This study evaluates the efficacy of adding intravenous (IV) or epidural ketamine to thoracic epidural analgesia (TEA) after thoracotomy. Materials and Methods: Double-blind randomized study on patients undergoing thoracotomy allocated to one of the following: group Kiv (IV racemic ketamine 0.5 mg/kg preincisional +0.25 mg/kg/h for 48 h), group Kep (epidural racemic ketamine 0.5 mg/kg preincisional +0.25 mg/kg/h for 48 h), or group S (saline). Postoperative analgesia was ensured by TEA with ropivacaine and fentanyl. Pain visual analog scales (VAS), Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, Catastrophizing Scale, and Quantitative Sensory Testing, measuring both the peri-incisional and distant hyperalgesia area, were conducted preoperatively and postoperatively until 6 months. Plasma ketamine levels and stability of the analgesic solutions were analyzed. Results: A total of 104 patients were included. PPP incidence was 20% at 6 months. Pain scores on coughing were significantly lower in Kiv and Kep than in S at 24 and 72 hours, but there were no differences afterwards. There were no significant differences in pain at rest, Neuropathic Pain Symptom Inventory, and Catastrophizing Scale, or in the area of mechanical allodynia at any time. Adverse effects were mild. Plasma ketamine levels did not differ significantly between groups. Analgesic solutions were stable. Conclusions: Adding epidural or IV racemic ketamine to TEA after thoracotomy did not lead to any reduction in PPP or allodynia. Epidural administration produced similar plasma ketamine levels to the IV route. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

We aimed to assess the prevalence of recreational drug use and its association with in-hospital major adverse events (MAEs) in patients admitted to intensive cardiac care units (ICCU). METHODS: In the Addiction in Intensive Cardiac Care Units (ADDICT-ICCU) study, systematic screening for recreational drugs was performed by prospective urinary testing all patients admitted to ICCU in 39 French centres from 7 to 22 April 2021. The primary outcome was prevalence of recreational drug detection. In-hospital MAEs were defined by death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or haemodynamic shock. RESULTS: Of 1499 consecutive patients (63±15 years, 70% male), 161 (11%) had a positive test for recreational drugs (cannabis 9.1%, opioids 2.1%, cocaine 1.7%, amphetamines 0.7%, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) 0.6%). Only 57% of these patients declared recreational drug use. Patients who used recreational drugs exhibited a higher MAE rate than others (13% vs 3%, respectively, p<0.001). Recreational drugs were associated with a higher rate of in-hospital MAEs after adjustment for comorbidities (OR 8.84, 95% CI 4.68 to 16.7, p<0.001). After adjustment, cannabis, cocaine, and MDMA, assessed separately, were independently associated with in-hospital MAEs. Multiple drug detection was frequent (28% of positive patients) and associated with an even higher incidence of MAEs (OR 12.7, 95% CI 4.80 to 35.6, p<0.001). CONCLUSION: The prevalence of recreational drug use in patients hospitalised in ICCU was 11%. Recreational drug detection was independently associated with worse in-hospital outcomes.

"5786","0","Preventive effect of oral magnesium in postmastectomy pain: protocol for a randomised, double-blind, controlled clinical trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Breast cancer affects 1 in 10 women worldwide, and mastectomy is a cause of chronic pain with neuropathic characteristics. N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists such as ketamine, memantine, dextromethorphan or magnesium are used to treat refractory pain by blocking NMDAR. Oral memantine has been shown to prevent postmastectomy pain and cognitive impact and to maintain quality of life. Likewise, the present study is intended to assess the preventive effect of oral magnesium, administered ahead of mastectomy, on the development of neuropathic pain. As a physiological blocker of NMDAR, magnesium could be an interesting candidate to prevent postoperative pain and associated comorbidities, including cognitive and emotional disorders, multiple analgesic consumption and impaired quality of life. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A randomised double‐blind controlled clinical trial (NCT03063931) will include 100 women with breast cancer undergoing mastectomy at the Oncology Hospital, Clermont‐Ferrand, France. Magnesium (100 mg/day; n=50) or placebo (n=50) will be administered for 6 weeks, starting 2 weeks before surgery. Intensity of pain, cognitive and emotional function and quality of life will be assessed by questionnaires. The primary endpoint is pain intensity on a 0‐10 numerical rating scale at 1 month postmastectomy. Data analysis will use mixed models; all tests will be two‐tailed, with type‐I error set at α=0.05. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study protocol and informed consent form were approved in December 2016 by the French Research Ethics Committee (South East VI Committee). Results will be communicated in various congresses and published in international publications. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT03063931."
"8798","1","Is ketamine an appropriate alternative to ECT for patients with treatment resistant depression? A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has repeatedly shown to have rapid and robust antidepressant effects in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). An important question is whether ketamine is as effective and safe as the current gold standard electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). METHODS: The literature was searched for trials comparing ketamine treatment with ECT for depression in the Pubmed/MEDLINE database and Cochrane Trials Library. RESULTS: A total of 137 manuscripts were identified, 6 articles were included in this review. Overall quality of the included studies was diverse with relevant risk of bias for some of the studies. Results suggest that ketamine treatment might give faster but perhaps less durable antidepressant effects. Side effects differed from ECT, in particular less cognitive impairment was apparent in ketamine treatment. LIMITATIONS: The included studies have limited sample sizes, use different treatment protocols and in most trials, longer term follow up is lacking. Furthermore, allocation bias appears likely in the non-randomized trials. CONCLUSIONS: Current available literature does not yet provide convincing evidence to consider ketamine as an equally effective treatment alternative to ECT in patients with TRD. There are indications for a more favourable short term cognitive side effect profile after ketamine treatment. Methodologically well-designed studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow up duration are warranted."
"8207","0","Relationship between drug use and prefrontal-associated traits.^\nThe prefrontal cortex plays an important role in the strategic and emotional regulation of behavior. Both cognitive and neuroimaging studies have implicated prefrontal cortex in processes of reward and addiction. Prefrontal-associated neurobehavioral traits may be measured psychometrically with the Frontal Systems Behavior Scale (FrSBe), so it was hypothesized that self-ratings on this instrument would correlate with parameters of psychoactive drug use in a community sample. Modest but significant correlations were found for various parameters of tobacco use, even after controlling for demographic variables. Significant differences were noted in the mean scores when non-users were compared with users of cannabis, major stimulants (e.g. cocaine, amphetamine), and dissociative hallucinogens (e.g. phencyclidine, ketamine) and polysubstance use, particularly with the Disinhibition subscale. Smokers rated greater dysfunction than non-smokers on all three subscales, with ex-smokers showing intermediate ratings between the two. Polysubstance users showed greater dysfunction on the Disinhibition subscale compared to non-polysubstance users. In summary, this study further supports a relationship between prefrontal dysfunction and drug use in normal individuals, convergently with other methodologies for studying addiction."
"3559","0","Sex-dependent metabolism of ketamine and (2R,6R)-hydroxynorketamine in mice and humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is rapidly metabolized to norketamine and hydroxynorketamine (HNK) metabolites. In female mice, when compared to males, higher levels of (2R,6R;2S,6S)-HNK have been observed following ketamine treatment, and higher levels of (2R,6R)-HNK following the direct administration of (2R,6R)-HNK. AIM: The objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of sex in humans and mice, and gonadal hormones in mice on the metabolism of ketamine to form norketamine and HNKs and in the metabolism/elimination of (2R,6R)-HNK. METHODS: In CD-1 mice, we utilized gonadectomy to evaluate the role of circulating gonadal hormones in mediating sex-dependent differences in ketamine and (2R,6R)-HNK metabolism. In humans (34 with treatment-resistant depression and 23 healthy controls) receiving an antidepressant dose of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg i.v. infusion over 40 min), we evaluated plasma levels of ketamine, norketamine, and HNKs. RESULTS: In humans, plasma levels of ketamine and norketamine were higher in males than females, while (2R,6R;2S,6S)-HNK levels were not different. Following ketamine administration to mice (10 mg/kg i.p.), C(max) and total plasma concentrations of ketamine and norketamine were higher, and those of (2R,6R;2S,6S)-HNK were lower, in intact males compared to females. Direct (2R,6R)-HNK administration (10 mg/kg i.p.) resulted in higher levels of (2R,6R)-HNK in female mice. Ovariectomy did not alter ketamine metabolism in female mice, whereas orchidectomy recapitulated female pharmacokinetic differences in male mice, which was reversed with testosterone replacement. CONCLUSION: Sex is an important biological variable that influences the metabolism of ketamine and the HNKs, which may contribute to sex differences in therapeutic antidepressant efficacy or side effects."
"1850","1","Neuronal correlates of visual and auditory alertness in the DMT and ketamine model of psychosis.^\nDeficits in attentional functions belong to the core cognitive symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Alertness is a nonselective attention component that refers to a state of general readiness that improves stimulus processing and response initiation. The main goal of the present study was to investigate cerebral correlates of alertness in the human 5HT(2A) agonist and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist model of psychosis. Fourteen healthy volunteers participated in a randomized double-blind, cross-over event-related functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study with dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and S-ketamine. A target detection task with cued and uncued trials in both the visual and the auditory modality was used. Administration of DMT led to decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent response during performance of an alertness task, particularly in extrastriate regions during visual alerting and in temporal regions during auditory alerting. In general, the effects for the visual modality were more pronounced. In contrast, administration of S-ketamine led to increased cortical activation in the left insula and precentral gyrus in the auditory modality. The results of the present study might deliver more insight into potential differences and overlapping pathomechanisms in schizophrenia. These conclusions must remain preliminary and should be explored by further fMRI studies with schizophrenic patients performing modality-specific alertness tasks."
"7900","1","Oral ketamine for treatment resistant major depression-a double blind randomized controlled trial.^\nBackground: Major depression is a devastating common disorder. Current pharmacotherapy centers on noradrenergic and serotonergic modulation, but effect may require up to 21. Moreover, over a third of patients remain poorly unresponsive, termed Treatment Resistant Depression (TRD). Recently, intravenous Ketamine been shown to provide rapid amelioration of TRD, but patients were followed‐up for extremely short times. We aimed to assess the clinical efficacy and safety of a three week course of oral ketamine in outpatients with TRD. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled trial and 22 TRD patients received either oral ketamine or placebo as outpatients for 21 days. Patients were evaluated at pre‐trial, 230 minutes after drug administration, and at 21 days. The main outcome measure was the change in Montgomry Asberg Depression Rating Scale‐ (MADRS) score. Results: 12 subjects were randomized to the ketamine group, and 10 to the placebo group. Four patients from the placebo group opted out due to treatment ineffectiveness. A repeated measures ANOVA showed a significant effect of time (F(1,16)=15.12, p=.001) together with a significant interaction between group an time (F(1,16)=7.58, p=.014). Tukey Honest significant difference (HSD) post hoc comparisons revealed a significant reduction in depression after 21 days in the ketamine group only (p=.0003). Conclusions: In this study, oral ketamine in a sub‐anesthetic dose caused a rapid amelioration of depressive symptoms in ambulatory TRD patients, and was well tolerated. The results of this study suggest that oral ketamine may hold significant promise in the care of outpatients with treatment resistant major depression."
"8387","1","Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced abnormal perception and thought process but not mood changes.^\nPURPOSE: To determine the effects of midazolam, 30 ngxmL(-1), on altered perception, mood, and cognition induced by ketamine. METHODS: After ketamine was administered to achieve target concentrations of 50, 100, or 150 ngxmL in 11 volunteers, perception, mood, and thought process were assessed by a visual analog scale. Mini-Mental State examination (MMSE) assessed cognition. Boluses of midazolam, 30, 14.5, and 12 microgxkg(-1), were injected every 30 min to maintain the plasma concentration at 30 ngxmL(-1), which was reached 30 min after each injection. RESULTS: Ketamine produced changes in perception about the body (P < 0.01, 0.001, and 0.0001 at 30, 60, and 90 min), surroundings (P < 0.01 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), time (P < 0.002 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), reality (P < 0.001 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min), sounds (P < 0.002 at 90 min), and meaning (P < 0.05 at 90 min). Subjects felt less energetic and clearheaded (P < 0.02 and 0.05) during ketamine, midazolam, and their co-administration. Ketamine impaired thought process (P < 0.003 and 0.0001 at 60 and 90 min). Ketamine and midazolam decreased mean total MMSE and recall scores (P < 0.001 for both). Co-administration reduced the number of subjects with perceptual (body, P < 0.01 and 0.001 at 30 and 60 min) and thought process abnormalities. Within the range of observation, co-administration did not affect the changes in mood or recall. CONCLUSION: Midazolam attenuates ketamine-induced changes in perception and thought process."
"9036","1","Information processing speed in ecstasy (MDMA) users.^\nPrevious research draws parallels between ecstasy-related and age-related deficits in cognitive functioning. Age-related impairments in working memory have been attributed to a slow down in information processing speed. The present study compared 29 current ecstasy users, 10 previous users and 46 non-users on two tests measuring information processing speed and a computation span task measuring working memory. Results showed that ecstasy users performed worse than non-ecstasy users in the letter comparison task although the overall difference was not significant (p = 0.089). Results from the pattern recognition task showed that current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than the other two groups (p < 0.01). When results were combined for both the letter and pattern tasks, once again current ecstasy users produced significantly more errors than non-ecstasy users (p < 0.01). Working memory deficits obtained were statistically significant with both ecstasy using groups performing significantly worse than non-users on the computation span measure (p < 0.01). Moreover, ANCOVA with measures of processing speed as covariates failed to eliminate the group difference in computation span (p < 0.01). Therefore, it is likely the mechanism responsible for impairments in the computation span measure is not the same as that in elderly adults where processing speed generally removes most of the age-related variance. Also of relevance is the fact that the ecstasy users reported here had used a range of other drugs making it difficult to unambiguously attribute the results obtained to ecstasy use.

"644","1","Qualitative and Quantitative Features of Music Reported to Support Peak Mystical Experiences during Psychedelic Therapy Sessions.^\nPsilocybin is a classic (serotonergic) hallucinogen (""psychedelic"" drug) that may occasion mystical experiences (characterized by a profound feeling of oneness or unity) during acute effects. Such experiences may have therapeutic value. Research and clinical applications of psychedelics usually include music listening during acute drug effects, based on the expectation that music will provide psychological support during the acute effects of psychedelic drugs, and may even facilitate the occurrence of mystical experiences. However, the features of music chosen to support the different phases of drug effects are not well-specified. As a result, there is currently neither real guidance for the selection of music nor standardization of the music used to support clinical trials with psychedelic drugs across various research groups or therapists. A description of the features of music found to be supportive of mystical experience will allow for the standardization and optimization of the delivery of psychedelic drugs in both research trials and therapeutic contexts. To this end, we conducted an anonymous survey of individuals with extensive experience administering psilocybin or psilocybin-containing mushrooms under research or therapeutic conditions, in order to identify the features of commonly used musical selections that have been found by therapists and research staff to be supportive of mystical experiences within a psilocybin session. Ten respondents yielded 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of peak effects with psilocybin, and 24 unique recommendations of musical stimuli supportive of the period leading up to a peak experience. Qualitative analysis (expert rating of musical and music-theoretic features of the recommended stimuli) and quantitative analysis (using signal processing and music-information retrieval methods) of 22 of these stimuli yielded a description of peak period music that was characterized by regular, predictable, formulaic phrase structure and orchestration, a feeling of continuous movement and forward motion that slowly builds over time, and lower perceptual brightness when compared to pre peak music. These results provide a description of music that may be optimally supportive of peak psychedelic experiences. This description can be used to guide the selection and composition of music for future psychedelic research and therapy sessions."

"5059","0","Prevalence and Risk Factors of Substance Use among Urban Adolescents: Questionnaire Study.^\nAim. To examine the prevalence and possible interconnections among the frequencies of consuming various psychoactive substances in Zagreb adolescents. Also, to assess risk factors associated with the use of tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. Method. We applied an anonymous, multi-dimensional, self-reporting questionnaire on a representative sample of 2,404 elementary and high school students (total age range, 13-23 years) from Zagreb, Croatia. The questionnaire was designed to explore the extent to which examinees consumed various psychoactive substances, as well as to assess their attitudes and knowledge about the substances. The socio-demographic data were collected on all examinees, their hierarchy of values, family relations, adjustment to school, relationships with peers, and high-risk and delinquent behavior. We analyzed the interconnections among the frequencies of consuming various psychoactive substances, and assessed the factors possibly predictive of substance use. Results. Almost 90% of all examinees experimented with alcohol at least once, 80% with tobacco, 39% with marijuana, and 9% with Ecstasy. Thirty-six percent consumed alcohol and 11% marijuana several times a month, whereas 28% smoked tobacco daily. Although there was no statistically significant difference according to sex in experimenting with psychoactive substances, day-to-day abuse was significantly more frequent among young men than women. About 43% of our examinees believed consuming marijuana should become legally permitted, 37% were against this policy, and 21% were undecided on this issue. Our results showed a high degree of interconnection among the frequencies of consuming tobacco, alcohol, and marijuana. We also found that the best predictive factors for consummation of these three substances were a history of high-risk and delinquent behavior, troubled adjustment to school, domination of hedonistic values, and poor family relations. Regression analysis and pondering for ratios of particular predictors of psychoactive substances use gave values for coefficients of multiple regression as follows: R=0.548 (R2 =0.300; p < 0.001) for tobacco, R = 0.575 (R2 = 0.330; p < 0.001) for alcohol, and R = 0.608 (R2 = 0.370; p < 0.001) for marijuana. Knowledge about the consequences of consuming psychoactive substances positively correlated with the frequency of consuming tobacco (r = 0.213, p < 0.001), alcohol (r = 0.226, p < 0.001), and marijuana (r = 0.320, p < 0.001). Conclusion. Most adolescents had personal experience with psychoactive substance abuse, mostly alcohol, tobacco, and marijuana, but only a smaller proportion became regular consumers. The frequency of substance consummation implied a generalized tendency towards substance abuse among Zagreb adolescents. Our findings could serve as empirical basis for the re-evaluation of the current drug prevention programs and programs aimed at preventing other forms of risk behavior among children and adolescents."
"3944","0","Overlapping Risky Decision-Making and Olfactory Processing Ability in HIV-Infected Individuals.^\nOBJECTIVE: Given neuroimaging evidences of overlap in the circuitries for decision-making and olfactory processing, we examined the hypothesis that impairment in psychophysical tasks of olfaction would independently predict poor performances on Iowa Gambling Task (IGT), a laboratory task that closely mimics real-life decision-making, in a US cohort of HIV-infected (HIV+) individuals. METHOD: IGT and psychophysical tasks of olfaction were administered to a Washington DC-based cohort of largely African American HIV+ subjects (N=100), and to a small number of demographically-matched non-HIV healthy controls (N=43) from a different study. Constructs of olfactory ability and decision-making were examined through confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). Structural equation models (SEMs) were used to evaluate the validity of the path relationship between these two constructs. RESULT: The 100 HIV+ participants (56% female; 96% African Americans; median age = 48 years) had median CD4 count of 576 cells/μl and median HIV RNA viral load <48 copies per milliliter. Majority of HIV+ participants performed randomly throughout the course of IGT tasks, and failed to demonstrate a learning curve. Confirmatory factor analysis provided support for a unidimensional factor underlying poor performances on IGT. Nomological validity for correlations between olfactory ability and IGT performance was confirmed through SEM. Finally, factor scores of olfactory ability and IGT performance strongly predicted 6 months history of drug use, while olfaction additionally predicted hallucinogen use. CONCLUSION: This study suggests that combination of simple, office-based tasks of olfaction and decision-making may identify those HIV+ individuals who are more prone to risky decision-making. This finding may have significant clinical, public health value if joint impairments in olfaction and IGT task correlates with more decreased activity in brain regions relevant to decision-making."
"7779","1","Increased intensity of Ecstasy and polydrug usage in the more experienced recreational Ecstasy/MDMA users: A WWW study.^\nRecreational Ecstasy/MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users often take a variety of psychoactive drugs, but there is little empirical data on how these drug consumption patterns change with greater experience of Ecstasy. The aim of this study was to compare the polydrug usage patterns reported by non-Ecstasy users, novice Ecstasy users, moderate Ecstasy users, and heavy Ecstasy users. In a WWW study of 763 unpaid volunteers, 481 had never taken Ecstasy, whereas 282 reported they had taken it. The Ecstasy users comprised 109 novice users (1-9 occasions), 136 moderate Ecstasy users (10-99 occasions), and 36 heavy Ecstasy users (+100 occasions). Each participant also reported their experience with a range of other psychoactive drugs. The Ecstasy users reported significantly greater psychoactive drug usage than the non-Ecstasy users. The novice, moderate, and heavy Ecstasy users also differed significantly from each other in the use of cocaine, amphetamine, LSD, and psilocybin mushrooms, but not of alcohol, cannabis, or cigarettes/nicotine. Experienced Ecstasy users also took significantly more MDMA tablets on each occasion, and reported a higher maximum weekly intake. The increased use of Ecstasy is associated with more intensive patterns of Ecstasy/MDMA intake, and the greater use of illicit CNS stimulants and hallucinogens, but not of alcohol, nicotine, or cannabis. These results are discussed in the context of cross-tolerance and drug predisposition/preference. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"333","0","Treating posttraumatic stress disorder with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy: A preliminary meta-analysis and comparison to prolonged exposure therapy.^\nSince the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) has become a major area of research and development. The most widely accepted treatment for PTSD is prolonged exposure (PE) therapy, but for many patients it is intolerable or ineffective. ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy (MDMA-AP) has recently re-emerged as a new treatment option, with two clinical trials having been published and both producing promising results. However, these results have yet to be compared to existing treatments. The present paper seeks to bridge this gap in the literature. Often the statistical significance of clinical trials is overemphasized, while the magnitude of the treatment effects is overlooked. The current meta-analysis aims to provide a comparison of the cumulative effect size of the MDMA-AP studies with those of PE. Effect sizes were calculated for primary and secondary outcome measures in the MDMA-AP clinical trials and compared to those of a meta-analysis including several PE clinical trials. It was found that MDMA-AP had larger effect sizes in both clinician-observed outcomes than PE did (Hedges' g=1.17 vs. g=1.08, respectively) and patient self-report outcomes (Hedges' g=0.87 vs. g=0.77, respectively). The dropout rates of PE and MDMA-AP were also compared, revealing that MDMA-AP had a considerably lower percentage of patients dropping out than PE did. These results suggest that MDMA-AP offers a promising treatment for PTSD."

"2666","1","Arginine vasopressin release in response to the administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""ecstasy""): is metabolism a contributory factor?.^\nThe aim of this investigation was to examine the effect of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) administration on arginine vasopressin (AVP) release. (R,S)-MDMA (40 mg) was administered to eight normally hydrated healthy male volunteers (22-32 years) and blood samples were collected up to 24 h. Plasma was assayed for AVP and cortisol by radioimmunoassays, and for MDMA and the N-demethylated metabolite, MDA, by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Sodium concentrations and osmolality were also determined. Plasma AVP increased in all subjects after MDMA administration and a significant negative correlation was observed between concentrations of AVP and both single and total enantiomer MDMA at 1 h (r < -0.91, P < 0.01). This had disappeared by 2 h (P > 0.7). Compared with basal values, no significant change was observed for osmolality or cortisol at 1 h after drug administration. In conclusion, plasma AVP concentrations increase after MDMA administration, but the increase is not part of a generalized stress response since cortisol did not increase concurrently. A significant negative correlation between plasma MDMA and AVP was observed soon after administration. The possibility that a pharmacological effect of MDMA is primarily mediated via one or more metabolites, rather than by the parent drug, should be considered."
"4938","1","Social determinants and distance from certified treatment centers are associated with initiation of esketamine nasal spray among patients with challenging-to-treat major depressive disorder.^\nIndicated for treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation, esketamine (ESK) is self-administered under supervision at certified treatment centers. Our study was to determine if social determinants of health and distance were associated with ESK utilization. We conducted a retrospective cohort study among 308 US adults initiating ESK between October 11, 2019 and December 31, 2020 and 1540 propensity-score matched controls with treatment-resistant depression or major depression with suicidal ideation. Adjusting for demographics, prior health care utilization and comorbidities, social determinant variables and distance were regressed separately on each outcome: ESK initiation, failure to complete induction (8 treatments in 45 days), and discontinuation within 6 months. ESK initiation was associated with higher population density (odds ratio [OR]: 2.12), American Indian, Alaska Native, Native Hawaiian, Other Pacific Islander (OR: 3.19), and mental health (OR: 1.55) and primary care providers (OR: 1.55) per capita. Lower likelihood of ESK initiation was associated with living > 7.2 miles from a treatment center (OR: 0.75), living in rural areas (OR: 0.64), and percent non-Hispanic African American (OR: 0.58) and Hispanic (OR: 0.40). Health care providers should tailor patient engagement strategies to mitigate potential barriers to initiating and continuing appropriate treatment. Failing to complete induction was associated with substance use disorder and longer distance to treatment center was associated with discontinuation (hazard ratio: 1.48), as was percent Asian population (hazard ratio: 1.37). Prior psychiatric care and residence in counties with high rates of primary care providers per capita, unemployment, and high school graduation were associated with both higher likelihood of completing induction and lower likelihood of discontinuation."
"1093","0","Ketamine reduces temporal expectation in the rhesus monkey.^\nRationale: Ketamine, a well-known general dissociative anesthetic agent that is a non-competitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor, perturbs the perception of elapsed time and the expectation of upcoming events. Objective: The objective of this study was to determine the influence of ketamine on temporal expectation in the rhesus monkey. Methods: Two rhesus monkeys were trained to make a saccade between a central warning stimulus and an eccentric visual target that served as imperative stimulus. The delay between the warning and the imperative stimulus could take one of four different values randomly with the same probability (variable foreperiod paradigm). During experimental sessions, a subanesthetic low dose of ketamine (0.25–0.35 mg/kg) was injected i.m. and the influence of the drug on movement latency was measured. Results: We found that in the control conditions, saccadic latencies strongly decreased with elapsed time before the appearance of the visual target showing that temporal expectation built up during the delay period between the warning and the imperative stimulus. However, after ketamine injection, temporal expectation was significantly reduced in both subjects. In addition, ketamine also increased average movement latency but this effect could be dissociated from the reduction of temporal expectation. Conclusion: In conclusion, a subanesthetic dose of ketamine could have two independent effects: increasing reaction time and decreasing temporal expectation. This alteration of temporal expectation could explain cognitive deficits observed during ketamine use. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"
"1239","1","Esketamine Nasal Spray for the Rapid Reduction of Depressive Symptoms in Major Depressive Disorder With Acute Suicidal Ideation or Behavior.^\nPURPOSE/BACKGROUND: Numerous health authority approvals of esketamine nasal spray, combined with oral antidepressant, to treat depressive symptoms in adults with major depressive disorder and acute suicidal ideation or behavior were based on 2 identically designed, double-blind, phase 3 studies. METHODS/PROCEDURES: Across both ASPIRE studies (NCT03039192, NCT03097133), patients (N = 456) were randomized to esketamine 84 mg or placebo nasal spray twice weekly for 4 weeks plus comprehensive standard of care, including hospitalization and newly initiated or optimized antidepressant(s). In post hoc analyses of pooled data, changes from baseline at 24 hours after the first dose in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score and Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised, in the full cohort and in subgroups, were analyzed using analysis of covariance. FINDINGS/RESULTS: Esketamine plus standard of care demonstrated significantly greater improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale total score versus placebo plus standard of care at 24 hours (least square mean difference [95% confidence interval], -3.8 [-5.75 to -1.89]) and at earlier (4 hours: -3.4 [-5.05 to -1.71]) and later time points (day 25: -3.4 [-5.36 to -1.36]). The between-group difference (95% confidence interval) for change in Clinical Global Impression-Severity of Suicidality-Revised at 24 hours was -0.20 (-0.43 to 0.04) for all patients and -0.31 (-0.61 to -0.01) for those with a history of suicide attempt. Common adverse events (≥20%) during esketamine treatment were dizziness, dissociation, nausea, somnolence, and headache. IMPLICATIONS/CONCLUSIONS: Esketamine plus comprehensive standard of care rapidly reduces depressive symptoms in patients with major depressive disorder who have acute suicidal ideation or behavior, especially in those with a history of suicide attempt, providing a new treatment option for this particularly ill and vulnerable population."
"3692","1","Risk of bias in randomized clinical trials on psychedelic medicine: A systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: The classical psychedelics, psilocybin, peyote, ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine, and lysergic acid diethylamide are considered promising new treatments for psychiatric illnesses, such as depression, anxiety, addiction, and obsessive-compulsive disorders. However, their profound and characteristic subjective effects raise concern for distinctive biases in randomized clinical trials. METHODS: We performed a systematic literature search to identify all clinical trials on classical psychedelics with patient populations to examine descriptive data and determine the risk of bias. Two independent reviewers searched three databases (PubMed, Embase, and APA PsycNet) and extracted information on study design, study population, use of active or inactive placebo, dropouts, evaluation of blinding of intervention, and reporting of expectancy and therapeutic alliance. RESULTS: We included 10 papers reporting on 10 unique trials. The trials generally included populations that were predominantly white and highly educated. The trials had small samples and considerable dropout. Blinding was either unsuccessful or not reported regardless of type of placebo. Few trials published protocols, statistical analysis plans (SAPs), and outcomes relating to psychotherapy fidelity. All trials but one were rated as high risk of bias. CONCLUSION: Successful blinding of intervention is a significant challenge in this field. To better accommodate this, we suggest that future trials use a parallel-group design and utilize an active placebo on a psychedelic-naïve population. Future trials should publish trial protocol and SAPs, use clinician-rated outcomes accessed by a blinded rater, evaluate blinding of intervention, and consider measuring expectancy and therapeutic fidelity."

METHOD: Two hundred thirty-seven mental health providers (74% female; mean age 54; 83% White; 46% psychologists) completed a 37-item online survey between November 2021 and February 2022, disseminated through local and state-wide professional organizations in California. RESULTS: Providers endorsed limited knowledge about the risks and benefits of psychedelic use (M = 4.7 and 5.4, respectively, with 10 = high knowledge) and inadequate knowledge to counsel patients on use (45%). Gaps in knowledge related to psychedelic drug scheduling and current use in clinical research were identified. Providers expressed support for additional psychedelic research (97%), approval of recreational (66%) and medical (91%) psychedelic use, belief in the potential therapeutic benefits of psychedelics (89%), and concerns about safety (33%) and potential psychiatric risks (27%). Results indicated that most providers discuss psychedelic use with patients (73%), yet many do not feel comfortable addressing the effects of use (49%). There were significant correlations between knowledge and attitudes towards psychedelics (r = 0.2, p = .006; r = 0.31, p < .001) and attitudes and clinical practices (r = 0.34, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Findings suggest that providers are interested in psychedelic-assisted treatments and hold favourable attitudes towards the therapeutic use of psychedelics yet lack the knowledge to appropriately counsel patients, highlighting the need for additional provider education about psychedelics."
"4030","1","A randomised study of intranasal dexmedetomidine and oral ketamine for premedication in children.^\nWe studied the effects of intranasal dexmedetomidine combined with oral ketamine for premedication in children. One hundred and sixty children aged between 2 and 6 years were randomly allocated to one of four groups: 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 1); 1 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 2); 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 3); and 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine with 5 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine (Group 4). Sedation levels 10, 20 and 30 min after premedication were evaluated using a 5-point sedation scale. A 4-point emotional state score was used to evaluate patients when they were separated from their parents and their response to intravenous cannulation or facemask application. Approximately 90% of patients readily accepted premedication and onset times of acceptable sedation were similar in all four groups. Patients in Group 4 were significantly more sedated than those in Group 1 after 30 min (p = 0.036). A significantly higher proportion of patients in Group 3 (84%) and Group 4 (87%) accepted intravenous cannulation compared with those in Group 1 (40%) and Group 2 (54%) (p = 0.001). We conclude that the administration of 2 μg.kg(-1) intranasal dexmedetomidine and 3 mg.kg(-1) oral ketamine was the optimal combination, with children being easily separated from their parent, accepting intravenous cannulation and without causing excessive side-effects or postoperative complications."
"5456","1","Altered pain responses in abstinent (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") users.^\nRATIONALE: (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a popular recreational drug that has potential to damage brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in humans. Brain 5-HT neurons play a role in pain modulation, yet little is known about long-term effects of MDMA on pain function. Notably, MDMA users have been shown to have altered sleep, a phenomenon that can lead to altered pain modulation. OBJECTIVES: This study sought to assess pain processing in MDMA users using objective methods, and explore potential relationships between pain processing and sleep indices. METHODS: Forty-two abstinent MDMA users and 43 age-matched controls participated in a 5-day inpatient study. Outcome measures included standardized measures of pain, sleep polysomnograms, and power spectral measures of the sleep EEG. When differences in psychophysiological measures of pain were found, the relationship between pain and sleep measures was explored. RESULTS: MDMA users demonstrated lower pressure pain thresholds, increased cold pain ratings, increased pain ratings during testing of diffuse noxious inhibitory control, and decreased Stage 2 sleep. Numerous significant relationships between sleep and pain measures were identified, but differences in sleep between the two groups were not found to mediate altered pain perception in MDMA users. CONCLUSIONS: Abstinent MDMA users have altered pain perception and sleep architecture. Although pain and sleep outcomes were related, differences in sleep architecture in MDMA users did not mediate altered pain responses. It remains to be determined whether alterations in pain perception in MDMA users are secondary to neurotoxicity of 5-HT-mediated pain pathways or alterations in other brain processes that modulate pain perception."

We aimed to develop and examine the psychometric properties of the Attitudes on Psychedelics Questionnaire (APQ) in a sample of the Croatian general population. A cross-sectional, web-based survey among the general population was conducted on 1153 participants (62.1% female, 77.7% with a graduate or high school degree, 15.1% health care workers). We assessed participants’ ability to recognize psychedelic substances using a short knowledge test. The APQ consists of 20 items with four sub-scales: Legal Use of Psychedelics, Effects of Psychedelics, Risk Assessment of Psychedelics, and Openness to Psychedelics. This model demonstrated best fit in a confirmatory factor analysis. Total scale reliability was excellent (McDonald’s ω = 0.949, 95% CI = 0.944–0.953). A strong correlation with a similar unvalidated measure (r = 0.885, P < 0.001) demonstrated convergent validity. We observed an association between attitudes and knowledge on psychedelics (r = 0.494, P < 0.001). Younger age, male gender, and lower educational status were associated with higher APQ scores. The APQ is valid, reliable, and could be applied in assessing educational interventions, patients’ treatment outcomes, and the attitudes of different groups of experts. We encourage further validation of the APQ in English. © 2022, The Author(s)."
"3613","1","Risk intentions following pill test scenarios are predicted by MDMA use history and sensation seeking: A quantitative field study at an Australian music festival.^\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Most Australian Governments have resisted supporting formal pill testing (drug checking) at music festivals. With limited knowledge available regarding post-pill test substance use behaviour, we aimed to understand risk behaviour within three pill test scenarios by determining the individual factors which predict subsequent risky or risk reduction intentions. DESIGN AND METHODS: Music festival attendees (N = 276) were presented with three hypothetical pill test scenarios and reported their risk intentions, MDMA use history and sensation seeking. The pill test scenarios described an inconclusive test (unknown substance), the detection of a high MDMA dose, or a harmful adulterant (PMA or PMMA). RESULTS: Findings revealed that access to pill test results would facilitate reduced risk behaviour rather than maintained or increased risk behaviour for people who have never used MDMA. However, people who have used MDMA were not necessarily more likely to engage in risk reduction following a pill test. Furthermore, and using predictive analyses, harm-reducing behaviours are less likely when a person has a history of MDMA use and for those high in sensation seeking, particularly if a test result indicates a high MDMA dose. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: Pill testing alone may not prevent adverse outcomes in some festival attendees. While some individuals are more likely to reduce their risk than maintain or increase their risk, other features of a pill test scenario (e.g. referral to support services, drug education) are likely to be important facilitators of harm reduction intentions."
"4836","0","The effects of cannabis and alcohol on simulated arterial driving: Influences of driving experience and task demand.^\nThis study compared the effects of three doses of cannabis and alcohol (placebo, low and high doses), both alone and in combination, on the driving performance of young, novice drivers and more experienced drivers. Alcohol was administered as ethanol (95%) mixed with orange juice in doses of approximately 0, 0.4 and 0.6g/kg. Cannabis was administered by inhalation of smoke from pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes (supplied by the National Institute of Drug Abuse, USA). Active cigarettes contained 19 mg delta-9-THC. Using a counterbalanced design, the simulated driving performance of 25 experienced and 22 inexperienced drivers was tested under the nine different drug conditions in an arterial driving environment during which workload was varied through the drive characteristics as well as through the inclusion of a secondary task. High levels of cannabis generally induced greater impairment than lower levels, while alcohol at the doses used had few effects and did not produce synergistic effects when combined with cannabis. Both cannabis and alcohol were associated with increases in speed and lateral position variability, high dose cannabis was associated with decreased mean speed, increased mean and variability in headways, and longer reaction time, while in contrast alcohol was associated with a slight increase in mean speed. Given the limitations of the study, it is of great interest to further explore the qualitative impairments in driving performance associated with cannabis and alcohol separately and how these impairments may manifest in terms of crash characteristics."
"5690","1","MDMA-assisted therapy for moderate to severe PTSD: a randomized, placebo-controlled phase 3 trial.^\nThis multi-site, randomized, double-blind, confirmatory phase 3 study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted therapy (MDMA-AT) versus placebo with identical therapy in participants with moderate to severe post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Changes in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM-5 (CAPS-5) total severity score (primary endpoint) and Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) functional impairment score (key secondary endpoint) were assessed by blinded independent assessors. Participants were randomized to MDMA-AT (n = 53) or placebo with therapy (n = 51). Overall, 26.9% (28/104) of participants had moderate PTSD, and 73.1% (76/104) of participants had severe PTSD. Participants were ethnoracially diverse: 28 of 104 (26.9%) identified as Hispanic/Latino, and 35 of 104 (33.7%) identified as other than White. Least squares (LS) mean change in CAPS-5 score (95% confidence interval (CI)) was -23.7 (-26.94, -20.44) for MDMA-AT versus -14.8 (-18.28, -11.28) for placebo with therapy (P < 0.001, d = 0.7). LS mean change in SDS score (95% CI) was -3.3 (-4.03, -2.60) for MDMA-AT versus -2.1 (-2.89, -1.33) for placebo with therapy (P = 0.03, d = 0.4). Seven participants had a severe treatment emergent adverse event (TEAE) (MDMA-AT, n = 5 (9.4%); placebo with therapy, n = 2 (3.9%)). There were no deaths or serious TEAEs. These data suggest that MDMA-AT reduced PTSD symptoms and functional impairment in a diverse population with moderate to severe PTSD and was generally well tolerated.

"9127","0","Psychedelics for Patients With Cancer: A Comprehensive Literature Review.^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the role of psychedelics in the treatment of anxiety or depression among patients with cancer. DATA SOURCES: PubMed search from inception to March 11, 2022, using the terms anxiety, depression, psychedelics, psilocybin, lysergic acid, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, or ayahuasca. STUDY SELECTION AND DATA EXTRACTION: Studies assessing patients with cancer receiving psychedelics for the treatment of anxiety or depression. DATA SYNTHESIS: Five unique randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials were conducted. Significant reductions were found in 2 trials with 2 anxiety scales (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-State, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory-Trait) and in 1 trial with 2 additional anxiety scales (Hamilton Rating Scale-Anxiety, Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Anxiety). Significant reductions were found in 2 trials in 2 depression scales (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale-Depression, Beck Depression Inventory) and in 1 trial with an additional depression scale (Hamilton Rating Scale-Depression). Two studies assessed for clinically relevant reductions in anxiety and depression scores, and they occurred much more commonly in psychedelic-treated patients than those given placebo. RELEVANCE TO PATIENT CARE AND CLINICAL PRACTICE: There is a new potential option for treating patients with anxiety and depression along with cancer, which is important given the generally lackluster benefits with traditional antidepressants. Only a few sessions may also provide benefits extending out for 6 to 12 months and possibly beyond that. However, the studies were small, had many methodological limitations, and there were increases in blood pressure and heart rate. CONCLUSIONS: Psychedelics have a unique mechanism of action that might be well suited for treating anxiety and depression associated with cancer. This offers new promise for patients who are not being sufficiently treated with current antianxiety or antidepressant medications."
"4832","0","Ketamine and Beyond: Investigations into the Potential of Glutamatergic Agents to Treat Depression.^\nClinical and preclinical studies suggest that dysfunction of the glutamatergic system is implicated in mood disorders such as major depressive disorder and bipolar depression. In clinical studies of individuals with major depressive disorder and bipolar depression, rapid reductions in depressive symptoms have been observed in response to subanesthetic-dose ketamine, an agent whose mechanism of action involves the modulation of glutamatergic signaling. The findings from these studies have prompted the repurposing and/or development of other glutamatergic modulators for antidepressant efficacy, both as monotherapy or as an adjunct to conventional monoaminergic antidepressants. This review highlights the evidence supporting the antidepressant effects of subanesthetic-dose ketamine as well as other glutamatergic modulators, such as D-cycloserine, riluzole, CP-101,606, CERC-301 (previously known as MK-0657), basimglurant, JNJ-40411813, dextromethorphan, nitrous oxide, GLYX-13, and esketamine."

B/S ratios were determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analysis following liquid-liquid extraction as a function of the hematocrit value (experimental specimens) and in blood and corresponding serum samples (n = 63) from 16 healthy volunteers participating in a controlled driving experiment (authentic specimens). A regression analysis to calculate the B/S ratio was performed followed by an analysis of covariances (ANCOVA). A linear relationship between the hematocrit value and the B/S ratio of both MDMA and MDA could be established from the experimental data. For MDMA, the regressions provided mean B/S ratios of 1.22 and 1.26 for the experimental setting and the authentic samples, respectively. For MDA, the analysis determined slopes of 1.15 and 1.27 for the experimental setting and field study, respectively. ANCOVA revealed that the method of determination (experimental vs. authentic specimens) did not influence the resulting slopes. A conversion factor of 0.80 may give an adequate estimate to derive the serum concentration for MDMA if only the concentration in whole blood is known, whereas such a definitive factor could not be established for MDA because of its very low levels in authentic samples."
"9529","1","Lack of opioid system in the antidepressant actions of ketamine.^\nComments on an article by Nolan R. Williams et al. (see record [rid]2019-03859-008[/rid]). Williams et al. demonstrated the role of the opioid system in the rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine in patients with treatment resistant major depressive disorder. In the small-sample, single-center crossover trial, the authors investigated the effects of pretreatment with the opioid receptor antagonist naltrexone (50 mg, 45 minutes before) on the antidepressant effects of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg, intravenous) in the patients. The authors conclude that opioid receptor activation is required for ketamine’s acute antidepressant effects, although the dissociative effects of ketamine are not mediated by the opioid system. However, the sample size (n = 7) of ketamine-responsive patients is too small. In addition, there are currently no reports showing the role of opioid receptors in the antidepressant effects of ketamine in rodent models of depression.

Nevertheless, there are limited data on the pharmacokinetics and pharmacokinetic-pharmacodynamic relationships of GHB in humans. We characterized the pharmacokinetic profile and exposure-psychotropic effect relationship of GHB in humans. Methods Two oral doses of GHB (25 and 35 mg kg-1) were administered to 32 healthy male subjects (16 for each dose) using a randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over design. Results Maximal concentrations of GHB were (geometric mean and 95% CI): 218 (176-270) nmol ml-1 and 453 (374-549) nmol ml-1 for the 25 and 35 mg kg-1 GHB doses, respectively. The elimination half-lives (mean ± SD) were 36 ± 9 and 39 ± 7 min and the AUC∞ values (geometric mean and 95% CI) were 15 747 (12 854-19 290) and 40 113 (33 093-48 622) nmol/min ml-1 for the 20 and 35 mg kg-1 GHB doses, respectively. Thus, plasma GHB exposure (AUC0-∞) rose disproportionally (+40%) with the higher dose. γ-Hydroxybutyrate produced mixed stimulant-sedative effects, with a dose-dependent increase in sedation and dizziness. It did not alter heart rate or blood pressure. A close relationship between plasma GHB exposure and its psychotropic effects was found, with higher GHB concentrations associated with higher subjective stimulation, sedation, and dizziness. No clockwise hysteresis was observed in the GHB concentration effect plot over time (i.e., no acute pharmacological tolerance). Conclusion Evidence was found of a nonlinear dose-exposure relationship (i.e., no dose proportionality) at moderate doses of GHB. The effects of GHB on consciousness were closely linked to its plasma exposure and exhibited no acute tolerance."

METHODS: This was a population-based cross-sectional survey using a validated questionnaire in students from 45 secondary schools in Hong Kong randomly selected over the period of January 2012 to January 2014. A total of 11 938 secondary school students (response rate, 74.6%) completed and returned a questionnaire that was eligible for analysis. Individual lower urinary tract symptoms and history of psychotropic substance abuse were documented. RESULTS: In this study, 11 617 non-substance abusers were regarded as control subjects and 321 (2.7%) were psychotropic substance users. Among the control subjects, 2106 (18.5%) had experienced at least one lower urinary tract symptom with urinary frequency being the most prevalent symptom (10.2%). Females had more daytime urinary incontinence (P<0.001) and males had more voiding symptoms (P=0.01). Prevalence of lower urinary tract symptoms increased with age from 13.9% to 25.8% towards young adulthood and age of ≥18 years (P<0.001). Among the substance users, ketamine was most commonly abused. Substance users had significantly more lower urinary tract symptoms than control subjects (P<0.001). In multivariate analysis, increasing age and psychotropic substance abuse increased the odds for lower urinary tract symptoms. Non-ketamine substance users and ketamine users were respectively 2.8-fold (95% confidence interval, 2.0-3.9) and 6.2-fold (4.1-9.1) more likely than control subjects to develop lower urinary tract symptoms. Females (odds ratio=9.9; 95% confidence interval, 5.4-18.2) were more likely to develop lower urinary tract symptoms than males (4.2; 2.5-7.1) when ketamine was abused. CONCLUSIONS: Lower urinary tract symptoms are prevalent in the general adolescent population. It is important to obtain an accurate history regarding psychotropic substance use when treating teenagers with lower urinary tract symptoms."
"1087","0","Antidepressant effects of ketamine: mechanisms underlying fast-acting novel antidepressants.^\nNewer antidepressants are needed for the many individuals with major depressive disorder (MDD) that do not respond adequately to treatment and because of a delay of weeks before the emergence of therapeutic effects. Recent evidence from clinical trials shows that the NMDA antagonist ketamine is a revolutionary novel antidepressant because it acts rapidly and is effective for treatment-resistant patients. A single infusion of ketamine alleviates depressive symptoms in treatment-resistant depressed patients within hours and these effects may be sustained for up to 2 weeks. Although the discovery of ketamine's effects has reshaped drug discovery for antidepressants, the psychotomimetic properties of this compound limit the use of this therapy to the most severely ill patients. In order to develop additional antidepressants like ketamine, adequate preclinical behavioral screening paradigms for fast-acting antidepressants need to be established and used to identify the underlying neural mechanisms. This review examines the preclinical literature attempting to model the antidepressant-like effects of ketamine. Acute administration of ketamine has produced effects in behavioral screens for antidepressants like the forced swim test, novelty suppression of feeding and in rodent models for depression. Protracted behavioral effects of ketamine have been reported to appear after a single treatment that last for days. This temporal pattern is similar to its clinical effects and may serve as a new animal paradigm for rapid antidepressant effects in humans. In addition, protracted changes in molecules mediating synaptic plasticity have been implicated in mediating the antidepressant-like behavioral effects of ketamine. Current preclinical studies are examining compounds with more specific pharmacological effects at glutamate receptors and synapses in order to develop additional rapidly acting antidepressants without the hallucinogenic side effects or abuse potential of ketamine."

METHODS: A quasi-experimental online survey of a convenience sample of psychiatrists in the United States (N=181; Mean age=48.7; Female=35%). Participants were randomized to receive 1-of-4 vignettes, each depicting a depressed patient reporting relief from symptoms after non-prescribed psychoactive drug use (i.e., psilocybin [Schedule I], methamphetamine [SchedII], ketamine [SchedIII], or alprazolam [SchedIV]). Participants responded to questions related to this clinical scenario and then rated the safety, therapeutic, and abuse potentials of these four drugs and alcohol. RESULTS: There were significant differences by vignette condition in mean likelihood ratings of: warning against engaging in drug use again (p<.01), being concerned about developing a new psychiatric problem (p<.001), being concerned about increased suicide risk (p<.01) and being supportive of further use of this drug as part of the treatment plan (p<.001). Overall, non-prescribed use of methamphetamine and alprazolam was rated more concerning and less acceptable than non-prescribed use of psilocybin and ketamine. Compared to psilocybin and ketamine, participants rated methamphetamine and alprazolam as less safe (p<.001), having less therapeutic potential (p<.001), and having more abuse potential (p<.001). Mean ratings of safety and abuse/therapeutic potential of alprazolam and methamphetamine were equivalent to that of alcohol, and all three were rated more harmful than psilocybin and ketamine. CONCLUSION: American psychiatrists' perceptions about safety and abuse/therapeutic potentials associated with certain psychoactive drugs were inconsistent with those indicated by their placement in drug schedules. These findings add to a growing consensus amongst experts that the current drug policy is not scientifically coherent."
"1505","0","New patterns of substance use and access to health care: A survey in rave parties.^\nAn ongoing survey started in March 2002 to get data on rave party attendees and substance use patterns in this particular population. Preliminary results show that people attending rave parties are rather heterogeneous regarding age and lifestyle. Alcohol, marijuana, ecstasy and cocaine are the most frequently used substances, the two latter being used especially on week-ends. Heavy polydrug use is most frequent by males and regular ravers. Nevertheless, attending rave parties regularly does not imply presenting such drug use pattern. Ravers seem more sensitive to harm reduction than prevention measures. In case of problems related to substance use, general practitioners are considered as the main access to health care."
"2555","1","Breaking Sad: Unleashing the Breakthrough Potential of Ketamine's Rapid Antidepressant Effects.^\nPreclinical Research The surprising results of a small clinical trial on the effects of low dose ketamine, a 65-year old anesthetic drug that is also used off-label for chronic pain and recreationally as a club drug, in eight depressed subjects unleashed the most significant advance in antidepressant drug development in decades. That study and subsequent ones have demonstrated that low dose, infused ketamine is able to induce a remission of depression in patients who have failed conventional medications, within 24 h. The apparent increased efficacy and rapid onset of effect of ketamine distinguish it from all other current antidepressant treatments. However, a single infusion of subanesthetic doses of ketamine produces benefits that typically last <3 weeks. The infusions are associated with a transient ""psychedelic"" experience and increased blood pressure that requires monitoring. There is also a theoretical potential to induce ketamine addiction. These features limit ketamine's ability to be a widely used treatment for depression and thus limit is ability to have a meaningful impact on the heavy morbidity and mortality associated with this disorder, despite its ""breakthrough"" rate of efficacy and speed of action. While growing numbers of clinicians are using ketamine to treat treatment resistant depression, many in the depression field believe that the aforementioned limiting aspects need to be separated from its remarkable therapeutic effects in order to unlock the breakthrough potential of this agent. To that end, drug development efforts have focused on various features of ketamine as targets for optimization including its modulation of the NMDA receptor, its pharmacokinetics, its chirality and its active metabolites including HNK (2R, 6R)-hyroxynorketamine.

"5159","1","Increased nature relatedness and decreased authoritarian political views after psilocybin for treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: Previous research suggests that classical psychedelic compounds can induce lasting changes in personality traits, attitudes and beliefs in both healthy subjects and patient populations. AIM: Here we sought to investigate the effects of psilocybin on nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This open-label pilot study with a mixed-model design studied the effects of psilocybin on measures of nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective in patients with moderate to severe TRD ( n=7) versus age-matched non-treated healthy control subjects ( n=7). Psilocybin was administered in two oral dosing sessions (10 mg and 25 mg) 1 week apart. Main outcome measures were collected 1 week and 7-12 months after the second dosing session. Nature relatedness and libertarian-authoritarian political perspective were assessed using the Nature Relatedness Scale (NR-6) and Political Perspective Questionnaire (PPQ-5), respectively. RESULTS: Nature relatedness significantly increased ( t(6)=-4.242, p=0.003) and authoritarianism significantly decreased ( t(6)=2.120, p=0.039) for the patients 1 week after the dosing sessions. At 7-12 months post-dosing, nature relatedness remained significantly increased ( t(5)=-2.707, p=0.021) and authoritarianism remained decreased at trend level ( t(5)=-1.811, p=0.065). No differences were found on either measure for the non-treated healthy control subjects. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot study suggests that psilocybin with psychological support might produce lasting changes in attitudes and beliefs. Although it would be premature to infer causality from this small study, the possibility of drug-induced changes in belief systems seems sufficiently intriguing and timely to deserve further investigation."
"4026","0","Pharmacotherapies for Treatment-Resistant Depression: How Antipsychotics Fit in the Rapidly Evolving Therapeutic Landscape.^\nOne in three adults with major depressive disorder (MDD) do not experience clinically significant improvement after multiple sequential courses of antidepressants and have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The presence of TRD contributes to the morbidity and excess mortality associated with MDD and has been linked to significantly increased health care expenses. In the absence of a consensus definition of TRD, this report takes a broad approach by considering inadequate response to one or more courses of antidepressants and focuses on atypical antipsychotics that are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treatment of depression (aripiprazole, brexpiprazole, cariprazine, extended-release quetiapine, and olanzapine-fluoxetine combination). While multiple acute-phase studies have demonstrated the efficacy of these medications in improving depressive symptoms, clinically meaningful improvement (i.e., remission) remains limited, with significant concerns about side effects (including weight gain, metabolic dysfunction, extrapyramidal symptoms, and tardive dyskinesia), especially with long-term use. With the rapidly evolving landscape of antidepressant treatments over the past few years, which has witnessed approval of rapid-acting antidepressants (e.g., esketamine nasal spray and dextromethorphan-bupropion combination) and several more in the late-stage pipeline (e.g., zuranolone and psilocybin), it remains to be seen whether the use of atypical antipsychotics will go the way of the older and rarely prescribed antidepressants (such as tricyclics and monoamine oxidase inhibitors). Pragmatic clinical trials are needed to compare the effectiveness of atypical antipsychotics with TRD-specific pharmacotherapies and neuromodulation treatments and to identify the optimal sequencing of these varied approaches for patients with MDD. When using atypical antipsychotics, clinicians and patients are encouraged to use a shared decision-making approach by personalizing treatment selection based on anticipated side effects, tolerability, cost, and feasibility."
"1358","1","Results of an international drug testing service for cryptomarket users.^\nIntroduction: User surveys indicate that expectations of higher drug purity are a key reason for cryptomarket use. In 2014-2015, Spain's NGO Energy Control conducted a 1 -year pilot project to provide a testing service to cryptomarket drug users using the Transnational European Drug Information (TEDI) guidelines. In this paper, we present content and purity data from the trial. Methods: 219 samples were analyzed by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). Users were asked to report what substance they allegedly purchased. Results: 40 different advertised substances were reported, although 77.6% were common recreational drugs (cocaine, MDMA, amphetamines, LSD, ketamine, cannabis). In 200 samples (91.3%), the main result of analysis matched the advertised substance. Where the advertised compound was detected, purity levels (m +/- SD) were: cocaine 71.6 +/- 19.4%; MDMA (crystal) 88.3 +/- 1.4%; MDMA (pills) 133.3 +/- 38.4 mg; Amphetamine (speed) 51.3 +/- 33.9%; LSD 123.6 +/- 40.5 mu g; Cannabis resin THC: 16.5 +/- 7.5% CBD: 3.4 +/- 1.5%; Ketamine 71.3 +/- 38.4%. 39.8% of cocaine samples contained the adulterant levamisole (11.6 +/- 8%). No adulterants were found in MDMA and LSD samples. Discussion: The largest collection of test results from drug samples delivered from cryptomarkets are reported in this study. Most substances contained the advertised ingredient and most samples were of high purity. The representativeness of these results is unknown. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."

Therefore, we evaluated a novel method to assess 5-HT release capacity in vivo using dexfenfluramine challenge and [18F]altanserin positron emission tomography (PET).Thirteen healthy male subjects received placebo and single oral doses of 40mg (n=6) or 60mg (n=7) of the potent 5-HT releaser dexfenfluramine separated by an interval of 14days. Three further subjects received placebo on both days. Two hours after placebo/drug administration, 250MBq of the 5-HT2A receptor selective PET-radiotracer [18F]altanserin was administered intravenously as a 30s bolus. Dynamic PET data were subsequently acquired over 90min. Moreover, arterial blood samples were drawn for measurement of total activity and metabolite correction of the input function. Dexfenfluramine as well as cortisol and prolactin plasma concentration-time profiles was quantitatively determined. Tracer distribution volumes for five volumes-of-interest (prefrontal and occipital cortex, insula, thalamus, caudatum) were calculated by the Logan plot and a 2-tissue compartment model. Dexfenfluramine dose-dependently decreased the total distribution volume of [18F]altanserin in cortical regions independent of the PET modeling approach. Cortisol and prolactin plasma concentrations were dose-dependently increased by dexfenfluramine. The decrease in cortical [18F]altanserin receptor binding under dexfenfluramine was correlated with the increase of plasma prolactin. These data suggest that the combination of a dexfenfluramine-induced 5-HT release and subsequent assessment of 5-HT2A receptor availability with [18F]altanserin PET is suitable to measure cortical 5-HT release capacity in the human brain. © 2011 Elsevier Inc.."
"2143","1","Pharmacology of ayahuasca administered in two repeated doses.^\nRATIONALE: Ayahuasca is an Amazonian tea containing the natural psychedelic 5-HT(2A/2C/1A) agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). It is used in ceremonial contexts for its visionary properties. The human pharmacology of ayahuasca has been well characterized following its administration in single doses. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the human pharmacology of ayahuasca in repeated doses and assess the potential occurrence of acute tolerance or sensitization. METHODS: In a double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial, nine experienced psychedelic drug users received PO the two following treatment combinations at least 1 week apart: (a) a lactose placebo and then, 4 h later, an ayahuasca dose; and (b) two ayahuasca doses 4 h apart. All ayahuasca doses were freeze-dried Amazonian-sourced tea encapsulated to a standardized 0.75 mg DMT/kg bodyweight. Subjective, neurophysiological, cardiovascular, autonomic, neuroendocrine, and cell immunity measures were obtained before and at regular time intervals until 12 h after first dose administration. RESULTS: DMT plasma concentrations, scores in subjective and neurophysiological variables, and serum prolactin and cortisol were significantly higher after two consecutive doses. When effects were standardized by plasma DMT concentrations, no differences were observed for subjective, neurophysiological, autonomic, or immunological effects. However, we observed a trend to reduced systolic blood pressure and heart rate, and a significant decrease for growth hormone (GH) after the second ayahuasca dose. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas there was no clear-cut tolerance or sensitization in the psychological sphere or most physiological variables, a trend to lower cardiovascular activation was observed, together with significant tolerance to GH secretion."
"4694","1","Neural correlates of change in major depressive disorder anhedonia following open-label ketamine.^\nAnhedonia is a cardinal symptom of major depression and is often refractory to standard treatment, yet no approved medication for this specific symptom exists. In this exploratory re-analysis, we assessed whether administration of rapid-acting antidepressant ketamine was associated specifically with reduced anhedonia in medication-free treatment-refractory patients with major depressive disorder in an open-label investigation. Additionally, participants received either oral riluzole or placebo daily beginning 4 hours post-infusion. A subgroup of patients underwent fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography scans at baseline (1-3 days pre-infusion) and 2 hours post-ketamine infusion. Anhedonia rapidly decreased following a single ketamine infusion; this was sustained for up to three days, but was not altered by riluzole. Reduced anhedonia correlated with increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus and dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and decreased metabolism in the inferior frontal gyrus and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC). The tentative relationship between change in anhedonia and glucose metabolism remained significant in dACC and OFC, and at trend level in the hippocampus, a result not anticipated, when controlling for change in total depression score. Results, however, remain tenuous due to the lack of a placebo control for ketamine. In addition to alleviating overall depressive symptoms, ketamine could possess anti-anhedonic potential in major depressive disorder, which speculatively, may be mediated by alterations in metabolic activity in the hippocampus, dACC and OFC."

"6739","1","Comparing the analgesic effect of intranasal with intravenous ketamine in isolated orthopedic trauma: A randomized clinical trial.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine is commonly used in anesthetic and sedation before surgical procedures and acts as an analgesic in smaller doses. The aim of this study was to assess the effects of intranasal (IN) ketamine in patients with moderate to severe limb trauma (visual analog scale (VAS) > 60 mm). METHODS: In a triple-blind randomized controlled clinical trial; 154 patients with isolated orthopedic trauma and visual analog scale (VAS) ≥60 mm were included on the basis of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Patients were divided into two groups of ketamine-IN (0.4 mg/kg IN ketamine and an equal volume of placebo saline intravenously (IV)) and ketamine-IV (0.2 mg/kg ketamine IV with 0.5 ml saline IN) on the basis of balanced block randomization method. At 5, 10, 20, and 30 min, patients were assessed for VAS measurement and adverse events. Repeated measure ANOVA, independent t-test and chi square test were employed. The level of statistical significance was considered to be less than 0.05. RESULTS: Mean VAS in IN ketamine and IV group at minute 30 was 31.50 ± 13.40 and 29.35 ± 11.73, respectively. At minute 30, 31 patients (20.39%) required a low-dose of morphine as rescue analgesia (P = 0.427). The results showed that mean change score of VAS (difference of time 0 and time 30) in IN ketamine and IV ketamine VAS were 43.8 (95% confidence interval: 41.1-46.5) and 46.4 (95% confidence interval: 42.8-50.1) and there is no difference between two groups in case of score change of VAS (P = 0.245). Adverse events in nasal and intravenous ketamine in both groups were mild and transient. CONCLUSION: IN ketamine is associated with few side effects and appropriate analgesic effects in isolated orthopedic trauma patients, and it may be used in cases where there is no need for venipuncture of peripheral vessels, especially in crowded EDs."
"2020","0","Frequent childhood geographic relocation: its impact on drug use initiation and the development of alcohol and other drug-related problems among adolescents and young adults.^\nEarly geographic relocation has been implicated as an important correlate of psychopathology, learning difficulties, and behavioural problems among child and adolescent populations, yet systematic studies of the potential influence of relocation on youthful drug use have not been conducted. This study explored the relationship between number of geographic moves before the age of 16 and the timing of onset of drug use and progression to drug-related problems. Data were obtained from 3,700 young adults aged 18 to 35 years participating in the 1990-1991 Ontario Mental Health Supplement, a large random probability survey of the residents of the Province of Ontario, Canada. Holding constant potential confounding factors, results showed highly significant positive relationships between moving and early initiation of illicit drugs including marijuana, hallucinogens, crack/cocaine, and illicit use of prescribed drugs. Among marijuana users, moving was also associated with a hastening of time to marijuana-related problems. Relationships between moving and measures of alcohol use/problems (onset of first drink, onset of any alcohol-related problem) were either weak or nonsignificant. Important sex differences were found, with statistically significant relationships between moving and early drug use initiation and progression occurring primarily among males. Future research is required to test for possible mediating mechanisms linking relocation with drug use as well as moderating influences. Efforts should also focus on finding out why drug use appears to be a more common response to relocation among boys."
"1442","1","Antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of ketamine on the functional connectivity of prefrontal cortex-related circuits in treatment-resistant depression: A double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, longitudinal resting fMRI study.^\nBACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that infusion of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine exerts antidepressant and antisuicidal effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). AIMS: In this investigation, we used the resting functional connectivity magnetic resonance imaging (fcMRI) to determine the effects of ketamine on the functional connectivity (FC) of prefrontal cortex (PFC)-related circuits in patients with TRD. METHODS: Forty-eight patients with TRD were recruited and randomly divided into three groups on the basis of ketamine infusion dose: 0.5 mg/kg (standard dose), 0.2 mg/kg (low dose), or normal saline (a placebo infusion). Resting functional MRI data and clinical data were recorded at the baseline and on the third day after ketamine infusion treatment. RESULTS: The standard-dose group showed a reduction in the FC of the left dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC) and right dorsolateral (dl)PFC with the other frontal regions. The low-dose group demonstrated a more pervasive reduction of FC in the bilateral dACC with other frontal and parietal regions. A negative correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the reduction in the FC between the left dACC and right ACC regions in the standard-dose group, whereas a positive correlation was observed between the reduction in suicidal ideation and the increase in the FC between the right dlPFC and left superior parietal region in the low-dose group. CONCLUSIONS: Our results support the hypothesis that PFC-related circuit modulation is crucial to the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of the ketamine infusion treatment."
"3757","1","A proof-of concept randomized controlled trial to show that the antidepressant effect of psilocybin does not require a psychedelic experience: study protocol.^\nIntroduction: During the last decade there has been a resurgence of interest on the use of psychedelics as novel treatments for mental disorders, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Psilocybin, the chemical component of magic mushrooms , has been administered with psychotherapy in randomized clinical trials (RCTs) showing large and sustained antidepressant effects. As the use of psilocybin expands, it is becoming more important to understand whether psilocybin's psychedelic effects are required for psilocybin's antidepressant effects. Psilocybin's psychedelic effects are known to be dependent on serotonin 2A receptor (5‐HT2AR) activation. Given the safety concerns associated with psilocybin's psychedelic effects, all studies have used it in conjunction with at least 12 hours of intensive psychotherapy. This makes psilocybin‐assisted psychotherapy (PAP) highly resource intensive and impedes scalability given limited resources and access to trained therapists in most jurisdictions. Studies in healthy volunteers have shown that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are blocked by 5‐HT2AR antagonists like risperidone and ketanserin. In a preclinical study using a mouse model of depression, administration of ketanserin followed by psilocybin had the same antidepressant effect as psilocybin alone. We propose to conduct the first study to test in humans whether the antidepressant effects of psilocybin are attenuated by 5‐HT2AR blockade from risperidone. Objectives: Aim 1: To evaluate the feasibility and tolerability of administering psilocybin with risperidone in adults with TRD by evaluating recruitment, retention, tolerability, and safety. Aim 2: To evaluate psychedelic effects (measured with the 5‐Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale) in the three groups. Aim 3: To evaluate antidepressant effects (measured with the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale; MADRS) in the three groups. . Methods: A three‐arm, 4‐week, double blind, proof‐of‐concept RCT for patients with a DSM‐5 major depressive episode that has failed to respond to at least two adequate trials of antidepressants. Participants will be randomized to: 1) psilocybin 25 mg plus risperidone 1 mg; 2) psilocybin 25 mg plus placebo; 3) placebo plus risperidone 1 mg. All participants will receive 12 hours of manualized psychotherapy. Results: Ethics approval for the proposed study has been obtained. We will present preliminary feasibility data at the meeting in March. Conclusions: If the study demonstrates that psilocybin's psychedelic effects are not necessary for psilocybin's antidepressant effects, the combination of psilocybin and a 5‐HT2AR antagonist, such as risperidone, could increase acceptability and access to the use of psilocybin to treat MDD and related conditions."

Because there is also evidence that cannabis sativa may cause cognitive impairment in healthy users, we performed a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled crossover trial for delta9-THC in 12 adult TS patients to investigate whether treatment of TS with a single dose of delta9-THC at 5.0 to 10.0 mg causes significant side effects on neuropsychological performance. Using a variety of neuropsychological tests, we found no significant differences after treatment with delta9-THC compared to placebo treatment in verbal and visual memory, reaction time, intelligence, sustained attention, divided attention, vigilance, or mood. Only when using the Symptom Checklist 90-R (SCL-90-R) did our data provide evidence for a deterioration of obsessive-compulsive behavior (OCB) and a trend towards an increase in phobic anxiety. However, these results should be interpreted with caution as SCL-90-R has known limitations on measuring OCB. We suggest that the increase in phobic anxiety is mainly due to the fact that a single-dose treatment rules out the possibility of administering the dosage slowly. In contrast to results obtained from healthy marijuana users, a single-dose treatment with delta9-THC in patients suffering from TS does not cause cognitive impairment. We therefore suggest that further investigations should concentrate on the effects of a longer-term therapy of TS with delta9-THC."
"8801","1","Repeated oral esketamine in patients with treatment resistant depression and comorbid posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine and its S-enantiomer esketamine are novel pharmacotherapeutic options for treatment resistant depression (TRD). There is growing evidence on the efficacy for other psychiatric disorders, including posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). It is hypothesized that psychotherapy may further potentiate the effects of (es)ketamine in psychiatric disorders. METHODS: Repeated oral esketamine was prescribed once or twice weekly in five patients suffering from TRD and comorbid PTSD. We describe the clinical effects of esketamine and report data from psychometric instruments and patients' perspectives. RESULTS: Esketamine treatment duration ranged from six weeks to a year. In four patients, we observed improvement in depressive symptoms, increased resilience and more receptiveness to psychotherapy. One patient experienced symptom worsening in response to a threatening situation during esketamine treatment, highlighting the need for a safe setting. DISCUSSION: (Es)ketamine treatment within a psychotherapeutic framework appears promising in patients with treatment resistant symptoms of depression and PTSD. Controlled trials are warranted to validate these results and to elucidate the optimal treatment methods."
"2311","0","Quantification of methylone and metabolites in rat and human plasma by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.^\nMethylone is a commonly abused synthetic cathinone derivative marketed as a “legal” alternative to “ecstasy” or cocaine. Previous studies examined the metabolism of methylone in vitro and in vivo; 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethcathinone (HMMC) was identified as the primary metabolite, with other reported minor metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxycathinone (MDC) and 3,4-dihydroxymethcathinone (HHMC). However, limited information is known about methylone and its metabolites’ pharmacokinetics. We developed and fully validated a method for the simultaneous quantification of methylone, HMMC, MDC and HHMC by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in 100 µl rat and human plasma. β-Glucuronidase was utilized for plasma hydrolysis, followed by perchloric acid protein precipitation and solid-phase extraction utilizing cation exchange columns. Chromatographic separation was performed with a Synergi Polar column in gradient mode, and analytes were determined by two multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions. Linear ranges of 0.5–1,000 µg/l (methylone, HMMC and MDC) and 10–1,000 µg/l (HHMC) were achieved. Bias and imprecision were generally acceptable, although quantification of HHMC exhibited variability (16.2–37 %). Extraction efficiencies and ion suppression were 89.9–104 % (for HHMC, 15.9–16.2 %) and < 11.4 %, respectively. Methylone and metabolites were stable in plasma for 24 h at room temperature, 72 h at 4 °C, and after three freeze–thaw cycles (except for a 60 % HMMC increase). Human and rat plasma were cross-validated, documenting that rat plasma quality control samples were accurately quantified against a human plasma calibration curve (−23.8 to 12 % bias). As proof of method, rat plasma specimens were analyzed pre-injection and after subcutaneous administration of methylone at 6 mg/kg from 15 to 480 min post-dosing. Methylone, HMMC, MDC and HHMC concentrations ranged from 1.1 to 1,310, 11.2 to 194, 1.9 to 152 and 24.7 to 188 µg/l, respectively."
"4821","0","Effect of four-week cannabidiol treatment on cognitive function: secondary outcomes from a randomised clinical trial for the treatment of cannabis use disorder.^\nRATIONALE: Chronic cannabis use is associated with impaired cognitive function. Evidence indicates cannabidiol (CBD) might be beneficial for treating cannabis use disorder. CBD may also have pro-cognitive effects; however, its effect on cognition in people with cannabis use disorder is currently unclear. OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether a 4-week CBD treatment impacted cognitive function. We hypothesised that CBD treatment would improve cognition from baseline to week 4, compared to placebo. METHODS: Cognition was assessed as a secondary outcome in a phase 2a randomised, double-blind, parallel-group and placebo-controlled clinical trial of 4-week daily 200 mg, 400 mg and 800 mg CBD for the treatment of cannabis use disorder. Participants had moderate or severe DSM-5 cannabis use disorder and intended to quit cannabis use. Our pre-registered primary cognitive outcome was delayed prose recall. Secondary cognitive outcomes were immediate prose recall, stop signal reaction time, trail-making task performance, verbal fluency and digit span. RESULTS: Seventy participants were randomly assigned to placebo (n = 23), 400 mg CBD (n = 24) and 800 mg CBD (n = 23). A 200 mg group was eliminated from the trial because it was an inefficacious dose at interim analysis (n = 12) and was not analysed here. For the primary cognitive outcome, there was no effect of CBD compared to placebo, evidenced by a lack of dose-by-time interaction at 400 mg (0.46, 95%CIs: - 1.41, 2.54) and 800 mg (0.89, 95%CIs: - 0.99, 2.81). There was no effect of CBD compared to placebo on secondary cognitive outcomes, except backwards digit span which increased following 800 mg CBD (0.30, 95%CIs: 0.02, 0.58). CONCLUSIONS: In this clinical trial for cannabis use disorder, CBD did not influence delayed verbal memory. CBD did not have broad cognitive effects but 800 mg daily treatment may improve working memory manipulation. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: The trial was registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02044809) and the EU Clinical Trials Register (2013-000,361-36)."
"1592","1","The effects of stereotype threat on cognitive function in ecstasy users.^\nStereotype threat occurs when individuals, believed to be intellectually inferior, perform badly on cognitive tests they perceive to confirm stereotypes about them. Due to the wide media coverage of studies purporting to show cognitive deficits in ecstasy users it is possible that they experience stereotype threat. This study tested ecstasy and non-ecstasy using polysubstance misusers on a variety of cognitive tests after they had been exposed to stereotype threat. This priming consisted of exposing them to information about the long-term effects of ecstasy which either stated that ecstasy caused memory loss or that it did not. Ecstasy users that had been primed that ecstasy did not cause cognitive deficits performed better than the other three groups on the delayed portion of the prose recall task from the Rivermead Behavioural Memory Test battery. There were no other statistically significant differences between any of the groups on any of the other cognitive tests used. This suggests that stereotype threat exists in ecstasy users and may be influencing their performance in experiments designed to identify cognitive deficits. In order to prevent this occurring in future studies, experimenters must be careful how they conduct their experiments and discuss their results with the media. © 2006 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"527","0","Overview of ketamine for major depression: Efficacy and effectiveness.^\nDepression is the leading cause of disability in the world. Ketamine is reported to have rapid antidepressant effects; however, there is limited understanding of the time course of ketamine effects beyond a single infusion. The level of proof of efficacy remains low and more randomized controlled trials are needed to explore the efficacy and safety issues of ketamine in depression. First introduced as an invaluable anesthetic, there is an emerging role for ketamine in the management of treatment-refractory depression. Given the role of cytokine-mediated inflammation in the pathophysiology of depression, an expanding body of scientific evidence indicates that ketamine has anti-inflammatory properties, which may contribute to its antidepressant effects. While there is unequivocal evidence that ketamine is an effective, potent, and rapid antidepressant when used as a standalone treatment, there is conflicting evidence for ketamine augmentation of Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). Even though there are significant clinical implications of ketamine formulation in the treatment of depression, it is important to underscore that, in contrast to esketamine, there is no current FDA approval of ketamine for the treatment of major bipolar or unipolar depression.

These differences could relate to personality, which may share common mechanisms with drug effects or impulsive, risk-taking behavior. The current study investigated the role of temperament and gender in the effects of amphetamine on risk taking. Forty healthy men and women, aged 18 to 35, completed the Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART; Lejuez et al., 2002) with three reward values after ingesting placebo or d-amphetamine (10, 20 mg). They completed the Multidimensional Personality Questionnaire Brief Form (MPQ-BF; Patrick et al., 2002), with three main scales: Trait reward sensitivity (Agentic Positive Emotionality; AgPEM), impulsivity (Constraint; CON), and negative affect (Negative Emotionality; NEM). d-Amphetamine (20 mg) decreased risk behavior in low AgPEM males, but increased risk behavior in high AgPEM males, producing positive correlations with AgPEM in men (r >= +.55, p <.05). The drug did not affect risk-taking in women. There was evidence of discriminant validity between the AgPEM, NEM, and CON dimensions and behavioral responses to amphetamine. Implications for treatment and addiction are discussed."

Here we aimed to evaluate patient outcomes in a residential addiction treatment center that employs a novel combination of Western and traditional Amazonian methods. Methods: The study was observational, with repeated measures applied throughout treatment. All tests were administered in the center, which is located in Tarapoto, Peru. Data were collected between 2014 and 2015, and the study sample consisted of 36 male inpatients who were motivated to seek treatment and who entered into treatment voluntarily. Around 58% of the sample was from South America, 28% from Europe, and the remaining 14% from North America. We primarily employed repeated measures on a psychological test battery administered throughout treatment, measuring perceived stress, craving frequency, mental illness symptoms, spiritual well-being, and physical and emotional health. Addiction severity was measured on intake, and neuropsychological performance was assessed in a subsample from intake to at least 2 months into treatment. Results: Statistically significant and clinically positive changes were found across all repeated measures. These changes appeared early in the treatment and were maintained over time. Significant improvements were also found for neuropsychological functioning. Conclusion: These results provide evidence for treatment safety in a highly novel addiction treatment setting, while also suggesting positive therapeutic effects."
"8339","0","Psilocybin, a Naturally Occurring Indoleamine Compound, Could Be Useful to Prevent Suicidal Behaviors.^\nThe available interventions for people who are at risk of suicide have limited efficacy. Recently, research on new mental health treatments has started to consider psychedelic compounds, particularly psilocybin, a molecule with a few thousand years of history of use in human societies. The possible effects of psilocybin on suicidal ideation and behaviors have not been specifically studied yet; however, the current knowledge on the suicidal process and the available data on es/ketamine suggest that psylocibin could be used to modulate the thoughts and behavioral patterns in individuals who are at risk of suicidal behaviors. Here, we summarize the available evidence on the possible mechanisms underlying psilocybin positive effects on suicide risk. Major pathways related to suicidal behaviors that might be modulated by psylocibin include serotonin receptors. Specifically, psylocibin directly stimulates the serotonin 2A receptor (5HT(2A)), targeting the inflammatory and oxidative stress pathways and leading to a rapid increase in brain plasticity and inflammation suppression and increases in cognitive flexibility, spirituality, and empathy. We also present preliminary epidemiological data and provide a rationale for studying psilocybin in individuals with suicidal ideation or who are at risk of suicidal behaviors. This review presents a framework to understand the basis for psilocybin use in individuals who are at risk of suicidal behaviors and calls for clinical studies."

In Germany, almost one in 25 juveniles aged between 12 and 25 years has used ecstasy, with use starting at an ever younger age. Method: The relationship between psychopathology (depression, anxiety and aggressiveness) and age of first use and intensity of use was examined in 84 ecstasy and 29 cannabis users. Results: An earlier onset of ecstasy use was related to a significantly greater severity of psychological symptoms. Conclusions: This outcome could be the consequence of neurotoxicity due to ecstasy use, or psychosocial disturbance could result in ecstasy use at an early age."
"809","1","Long-Term Efficacy of Combination Therapy of Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Ketamine for Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) is a safe, effective and non‐invasive treatment for many psychiatric illnesses, including treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, is also an effective antidepressant. This retrospective review examined the clinical benefits of combining these two established treatments for patients suffering from TRD in a novel approach coined combination TMS with ketamine (CTK). METHODS: A group of 28 adult patients with a primary diagnosis of unipolar (n=18) or bipolar (n=10) depression received three CTK treatments a week at a private neuropsychiatric practice. Patients were given a concurrent treatment of rTMS (1Hz; 40 minutes; 130% of motor threshold) with bio‐marker‐determined IV ketamine infusions (0.2‐4.7 mg/kg; 30 minutes). The TMS coil was positioned on the mid‐prefrontal area. Frequency of treatment was dependent on patient responsiveness (10‐30 sessions), which was measured as symptom reduction on the Clinical Global Impression (CGI) scale. CGI data was evaluated pre‐treatment, post‐treatment and at two‐year follow‐up. RESULTS: Mean reduction in CGI severity for the patient group following CTK was 4.46 ± 0.54 at a 99% confidence interval and was deemed statistically significant using a paired t‐test (a=0.01, t=22.81, p < 0.0001). This significant reduction in CGI severity was sustained for at least 2 years following treatment completion. CONCLUSIONS: Despite years of unsuccessful treatments, all 28 patients in this trial obtained substantial and enduring reductions in their depressive symptoms following CTK therapy. Further research into method optimization and randomized controlled trials are warranted."

Subjects (10 males and 2 females) without histories of opiate dependence were injected in an antecubetal vein with 0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/70 kg of morphine, by using a randomized, double-blind, cross-over design. Subjective effects, psychomotor performance and physiological measures were assessed immediately before the injection and for up to 5 hr afterward. Morphine increased the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group, Amphetamine, the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide and the Morphine-Benzedrine Group scores and decreased Benzedrine Group scores on the Addiction Research Center Inventory. Increased visual analog scale ratings of ""stimulated,"" ""high,"" ""sedated,"" ""coasting or spaced out"" and ""drunken"" were also obtained. On an opiate adjective checklist, subjects reported increased ratings of ""flushing,"" ""dry mouth"" and ""tingling."" Drug liking was not significantly altered by morphine, but there was substantial intersubject variability with this measure. Some aspects of psychomotor performance (reaction time, Digit Symbol Substitution Test and Maddox Wing) were impaired by morphine; however, eye-hand coordination was not. Miosis was induced by morphine. Most effects of morphine were dose-related, some effects peaked soon after morphine injection (e.g., increased stimulated and high ratings) and dissipated gradually, whereas other effects did not peak until later into the session (sedation or exophoria). Our results are fairly consistent with other studies examining morphine effects in healthy volunteers, and also indicate that the profile of morphine effects differ between healthy volunteers and those with a history of opiate dependence."
"1919","0","Human pharmacology of MDMA: pharmacokinetics, metabolism, and disposition.^\nMDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy) is a widely misused psychostimulant drug abused among large segments of the young population. Pharmacologically it displays effects related to amphetamine-type drugs and a set of distinctive effects (closeness to others, facilitation to interpersonal relationship, and empathy) that have been named by some authors ""entactogen"" properties. MDMA is a potent releaser and/or reuptake inhibitor of presynaptic serotonin (5-HT), dopamine (DA), and norepinephrine (NE). These actions result from the interaction of MDMA with the membrane transporters involved in neurotransmitter reuptake and vesicular storage systems. The most frequent effects after MDMA/ecstasy administration are euphoria, well-being, happiness, stimulation, increased energy, extroversion, feeling close to others, increased empathy, increased sociability, enhanced mood, mild perceptual disturbances, changed perception of colors and sounds, somatic symptoms related to its cardiovascular and autonomic effects (blood pressure and heart rate increase, mydriasis), and moderate derealization but not hallucinations. Acute toxic effects are related to its pharmacologic actions. The serotonin syndrome (increased muscle rigidity, hyperreflexia, and hyperthermia), among others, is characteristic of acute toxicity episodes. MDMA metabolism is rather complex and includes 2 main metabolic pathways: (1) O-demethylenation followed by catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT)-catalyzed methylation and/or glucuronide/sulfate conjugation; and (2) N-dealkylation, deamination, and oxidation to the corresponding benzoic acid derivatives conjugated with glycine. The fact that the polymorphic enzyme CYP2D6 partially regulates the O-demethylenation pathway prompted some expectations that subjects displaying the poor metabolizer phenotype may be at higher risk of acute toxicity episodes. In this metabolic pathway a mechanism-based inhibition of the enzyme operates because the formation of an enzyme-metabolite complex that renders all subjects, independently of genotype, phenotypically poor metabolizers after the administration of 2 consecutive doses. Therefore, the impact of CYP2D6 pharmacogenetics on acute toxicity is limited. One of the interesting features of MDMA metabolism is its potential involvement in the development of mid- to long-term neurotoxic effects as a result of progressive neurodegeneration of the serotonergic neurotransmission system."

A total of 1,947 members of UDV 18+ years old were evaluated in terms of years of membership and ceremonial attendance during the previous 12 months. Participants were recruited from 10 states from all major regions of Brazil. Alcohol and tobacco use was evaluated through questionnaires first developed by the World Health Organization and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration. Analyses compared levels of alcohol and tobacco use disorder between the UDV and a national normative sample (n = 7,939). Binomial tests for proportions indicated that lifetime use of alcohol and tobacco was higher in UDV sample compared to the Brazilian norms for age ranges of 25-34 and over 34 years old, but not for the age range of 18-24 years old. However, current use disorders for alcohol and tobacco were significantly lower in the UDV sample than the Brazilian norms. Regression analyses revealed a significant impact of attendance at ayahuasca ceremonies during the previous 12 months and years of UDV membership on the reduction of alcohol and tobacco use disorder."

However, knowledge of the reversibility of these neurotoxic effects based on in vivo evaluations of serotonin transport (SERT) availability remains limited. This study aimed to evaluate the long-term neurotoxicity of MDMA after 66 months abstinence and explored whether Dextromethorphan, a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, could attenuate MDMA-induced neurotoxicity using 4-[(18)F]-ADAM, an imaging ligand that selectively targets SERT, with positron emission tomography technology (PET). Nine monkeys (Macaca cyclopis) were used in this study: control, MDMA, and DM + MDMA. Static 4-[(18)F]-ADAM PET was performed at 60 and 66 months after drug treatment. Serotonin transport (SERT) availability was presented as the specific uptake ratios (SURs) of 4-[(18)F]-ADAM in brain regions. Voxel-based region-specific SERT availability was calculated to generate 3D PET/MR images. Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) volumetric analysis was also conducted at 60 months. Significantly decreased 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs were observed in the striatum and thalamus of the MDMA group at 60 and 66 months compared to controls; the midbrain and frontal cortex SURs were similar at 60 and 66 months in the MDMA and control groups. All eleven brain regions showed significantly lower (∼13%) self-recovery rates over time; the occipital cortex and cingulate recovered to baseline by 66 months. DM attenuated MDMA-induced SERT deficiency on average, by ∼8 and ∼1% at 60 and 66 months, respectively; whereas significant differences were observed between the thalamus and amygdala of the MDMA and DM + MDMA groups at 66 months. Compared to controls, the MDMA group exhibited significantly increased (∼6.6%) gray matter volumes in the frontal cortex, occipital cortex, caudate nucleus, hippocampus, midbrain, and amygdala. Moreover, the gray matter volumes of the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala correlated negatively with the 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs of the same regions. DM (n = 2) did not appear to affect MDMA-induced volumetric changes. The 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs, lower self-recovery rate and increased volumetric values indicate the occipital cortex, hippocampus and amygdala still exhibit MDMA-induced neurotoxicity after 66 months' abstinence. Moreover, DM may prevent MDMA-induced serotonergic deficiency, as indicated by increased 4-[(18)F]-ADAM SURs and SERT availability, but not volumetric changes."

First -- in a series of 11 experiments using different induction methods on N = 393 healthy subjects -- the hypothesis was tested that ASCs have major dimensions in common irrespective of the mode of their induction. In the International Study on Altered States of Consciousness (ISASC) the external validity of the experimental results was assessed. The ISASC was carried out on a total of N = 1133 subjects in six countries. The main results of the experimental studies were corroborated in the field studies. The results can be summarized as follows: the common denominator of ASCs is described by three oblique dimensions, designated as ""Oceanic Boundlessness (OSE)"", ""Dread of Ego Dissolution (AIA)"" and ""Visionary Restructuralization (VUS)"". The reliability and validity of the scales are satisfactory. Tested versions of the APZ scales are available in English (UK, USA), German, Italian and Portuguese. Psychometrically as yet untested versions exist in Dutch, Finnish, French, Greek, Spanish and Russian. The APZ questionnaire has become the international standard for the assessment of ASCs, thus helping to integrate research. A psychometrically improved version exists in German (OAV questionnaire).

Brain activity (using functional magnetic resonance imaging) is measured before and one week after drug administration in order to determine whether changes in brain networks related to emotional and self‐referential processing correlate with any observed changes in depression scores. Further, blood samples will be obtained from the participants and analyzed in order to reveal gene expression and molecular level correlates underlying rapid antidepressant effects, and to identify biomarkers that predict treatment outcome."
"7713","1","Long-term neuropsychological effects of ecstasy in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users.^\nRationale: Studies reporting ecstasy-induced serotonin-toxicity and (neuro)psychological dysfunctions have been conducted in young adults. Little is known about ecstasy effects later in life, when serotonin levels and cognition decrease as a consequence of normal ageing. Objective: This study aimed to assess whether harmful effects of ecstasy only add to or also interact with age-related neuropsychological decline. Methods: Attention, verbal and visual memory, visuospatial ability, self-reported depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity were assessed in middle-aged moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users (n=17) and compared with none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users (matched for age, gender, intelligence and other drugs; n=16) and a group of drug-naive controls (n=20). Results: Moderate to heavy ecstasy/polydrug users performed significantly worse on a verbal memory task than none or very mild ecstasy using polydrug users and drug naives. Moderate and heavy ecstasy/polydrug users also differed significantly from drug-naives on measures of depression, sensation-seeking and impulsivity but not from none or very mild ecstasy-using polydrug users. Conclusion: This study in middle-aged ecstasy/polydrug users replicated findings of studies in younger ecstasy users, showing a harmful effect of ecstasy on verbal memory. There was no clear support for an interaction between harmful effects of ecstasy use and age-related memory decline or mid-life depression. © 2009 The Author(s)."
"5277","0","Rapid GC-MS confirmation of amphetamines in urine by extractive acylation.^\nAmphetamine and related derivatives are widely abused central- and psychostimulants. Detection of certain derivatives, such as methcathinone, by commonly available immunoassay screening techniques is insufficient. Multi-analyte confirmations for amphetamine type stimulants are therefore required, but traditional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry methods necessitate lengthy analytical procedures with prolonged sample turn-around times. A validated rapid GC-MS assay for urinary confirmation of amphetamine, methamphetamine, methcathinone, ephedrine, norephedrine, methylenedioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine and N-methyl-1-(3,4 methylenedioxyphenyl)-2-butanamine is reported. The method entailed in situ derivatization of urine specimens by extractive acylation with pentafluoropropionic anhydride, followed by rapid chromatography on a microbore capillary column. Analytes were separated in less than 3 min and quantified simultaneously by selected-ion monitoring using stable isotope substituted internal standards. The total instrument cycle-time was 6 min per sample. The limits of detection were between 1.5 ng/mL and 6.25 ng/mL for the various analytes. Intermediate precision and accuracy were in the range of 6.3-13.8% and 90.5-107.3% for the respective analytes at the lower limit of quantitation, and between 5.8-12.6% and 95.4-103.1% for the high control. Long-term storage of methcathinone positive specimens at -20 °C proved insufficient stability of this analyte. The proposed assay is precise and accurate for confirmation of amphetamine and derivatives in urine. The complementary approach of extractive-derivatization and fast GC-MS analysis is especially applicable in routine clinical settings where reduced sample turn-around times are required. Further investigation of cathinone as a possible metabolite of methcathinone is warranted, based on results from analyzed authentic urine samples. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"800","1","Preliminary Report on the Effects of a Low Dose of LSD on Resting-State Amygdala Functional Connectivity.^\nBACKGROUND: The practice of ""microdosing,"" or the use of repeated, very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) to improve mood or cognition, has received considerable public attention, but empirical studies are lacking. Controlled studies are needed to investigate both the therapeutic potential and the neurobiological underpinnings of this pharmacologic treatment. METHODS: The present study was designed to examine the effects of a single low dose of LSD (13 μg) versus placebo on resting-state functional connectivity and cerebral blood flow in healthy young adults. Twenty men and women, 18 to 35 years old, participated in 2 functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning sessions in which they received placebo or LSD under double-blind conditions. During each session, the participants completed drug effect and mood questionnaires, and physiological measures were recorded. During expected peak drug effect, they underwent resting-state blood oxygen level-dependent and arterial spin labeling scans. Cerebral blood flow as well as amygdala and thalamic connectivity were analyzed. RESULTS: LSD increased amygdala seed-based connectivity with the right angular gyrus, right middle frontal gyrus, and the cerebellum, and decreased amygdala connectivity with the left and right postcentral gyrus and the superior temporal gyrus. This low dose of LSD had weak and variable effects on mood, but its effects on positive mood were positively correlated with the increase in amygdala-middle frontal gyrus connectivity strength. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings show that a very low dose of LSD, which produces negligible subjective changes, alters brain connectivity in limbic circuits. Additional studies, especially with repeated dosing, will reveal whether these neural changes are related to the drug's purported antidepressant effect."
"6158","1","Comparative Acute Effects of LSD, Psilocybin and Mescaline.^\nLSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), psilocybin (the active substance in ""magic mushrooms"") and mescaline (the active substance in Peyote and San Pedro cacti) are serotonergic hallucinogens widely used for recreational and/or ethnomedical purposes. LSD, psilocybin and mescaline are thought to induce prototypical psychedelic effects primarily via stimulation of the 5‐HT2A receptor. However, there are differences in their molecular structures (LSD: ergoline, psilocybin: tryptamine; mescaline: phenethylamine)and receptor activation profiles which may induce different subjective effects. To date, there are no modern studies comparing these three substances directly within the same clinical study and research subjects using validated psychometric tools. Therefore, the LPM‐Study compares the acute effects of LSD, psilocybin, mescaline and placebo in a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, 4‐period cross‐over design with four treatment conditions: 1) 100 μg LSD, 2) 20 mg psilocybin, 3) 300 mg mescaline, and 4) placebo. The main objective of this study is to determine whether LSD, psilocybin and mescaline produce qualitatively similar subjective alterations of mind and associated brain activity patterns despite their unique receptor activation profiles. The study investigates psychological (psychometry), physiological and neuronal (magnetic resonance imaging) variables. The LPM‐Study provides insight into the acute effects profiles of three serotonergic hallucinogens. It will enhance the understanding of psychedelic‐induced altered states of consciousness in humans and will be relevant for the fields of psychiatry, psychology, and forensic toxicology."
"5046","1","Effects of intra-operative administration of subanesthetic s-ketamine on emergence from sevoflurane anesthesia: a randomized double-blind placebo-controlled study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is administered in the perioperative period for its benefits in analgesia, anti-agitation and anti-depression when administered at a small dose. However, it is not clear whether the intra-operative administration of ketamine would affect emergence under sevoflurane anesthesia. To investigate this effect, we designed this trial. METHODS: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study, we enrolled 44 female patients aged 18-60 who were scheduled to elective laparoscopic gynecological surgeries. All patients were randomly assigned to saline or s-ketamine group. In s-ketamine group, patients received 0.125 mg/kg s-ketamine 30 min after the start of surgery. In saline group, patients were administered the same volume of saline. Sevoflurane and remifentanil were used to maintain general anesthesia. The primary outcome was emergence time. We also assessed postoperative agitation, cognitive function, and delirium. In addition, we collected and analyzed prefrontal electroencephalogram (EEG) during and after general anesthesia. RESULTS: There were no significant differences in emergence time between s-ketamine group and saline group (10.80 ± 3.77 min vs. 10.00 ± 2.78 min, P = 0.457). Neither postoperative agitation (4 [3, 4] vs. 4 [3, 4], P = 0.835) nor cognitive function (25.84 ± 2.69 vs. 25.55 ± 2.19, P = 0.412) differed between groups. No postoperative delirium was observed in either group. Subanesthetic s-ketamine resulted in active EEG with decreased power of slow (-0.35 ± 1.13 dB vs. -1.63 ± 1.03 dB, P = 0.003), delta (-0.22 ± 1.11 dB vs. -1.32 ± 1.09 dB, P = 0.011) and alpha (-0.31 ± 0.71 dB vs. -1.71 ± 1.34 dB, P = 0.0003) waves and increased power of beta-gamma bands (-0.30 ± 0.89 dB vs. 4.20 ± 2.08 dB, P < 0.0001) during sevoflurane anesthesia, as well as an increased alpha peak frequency (-0.16 ± 0.48 Hz vs. 0.31 ± 0.73 Hz, P = 0.026). EEG patterns did not differ during the recovery period after emergence between groups. CONCLUSION: Ketamine administered during sevoflurane anesthesia had no apparent influence on emergence time in young and middle-aged female patients undergoing laparoscopic surgery. Subanesthetic s-ketamine induced an active prefrontal EEG pattern during sevoflurane anesthesia but did not raise neurological side effects after surgery.

Methods: One hundred and ten patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer in Affiliated Cancer Hospital of Zhengzhou University from December 2020 to March 2021, were divided into two groups (n=55) using a random number table: group S received PCIA, with continuous infusion of S(+)-ketamine combined with sufentanil, while group C received PCIA, with continuous infusion of sufentanil. PCIA was initiated at the end of the surgery, and the formulations were as follows: group S, S(+)-ketamine (1.44 mg/kg), sufentanil (1.05 μg/kg), ketorolac tromethamine (2.0 mg/kg) and tropisetron (5 mg), in 100 ml of normal saline; group C: sufentanil (1.50 μg/kg), ketorolac tromethamine (2.0 mg/kg) and tropisetron (5 mg), in 100 ml of normal saline. Postoperative visual analogue scale (VAS) and Ramsay sedation scale were recorded at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48 h after the surgery. The incidence of remedial analgesia, the effective compressions number of PCI during 48 h after the operation. Time to first ambulation, time to first anal exhaust, time to resume oral feeding were recorded. The occurrence of adverse effects was compared between the two groups. Results: A total of 10 patients were excluded during the study, including 4 cases of conversion to laparotomy, 3 cases of dropping out of the study, and 3 cases with operation time more than 4 hours. Finally, 50 cases in group S and 50 cases in group C completed the study. There were no significant differences in VAS scores and Ramsay sedation sores at all time points between two groups (all P>0.05). Likewise, there were also no significant differences in the number of remedial analgesia and effective compressions of PCIA during 48 h after the operation between the two groups (both P>0.05). The total dosage of sufentanil consumption in group S [(64±9) μg] was lower than that in group C [(95±12) μg] within 48 h of PCIA, with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). Time to first ambulation in group S was (1.1±0.2) d, which was shorter than that in group C [(1.6±0.5) d], and the difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). Likewise, time to first anal exhaust in group S [(1.3±0.4) d] was shorter than that in group C [(1.8±0.6) d], with a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). Additionally, time to resume oral feeding in group S was (2.5±0.6) d, which was shorter than that in group C [(3.1±0.7) d], and there was a statistically significant difference (P<0.001). The incidence of nausea, vomiting and pruritus in group S were 4.0%, 2.0% and 0, which were lower than that in group C (16.0%, 10% and 8.0%, respectively), with statistically significant differences (all P<0.05). No case with psychiatric symptoms was found in both groups. Conclusion: When used for postoperative intravenous analgesia in elderly patients undergoing laparoscopic radical resection of rectal cancer, S(+)-ketamine combined with sufentanil can provide satisfactory analgesic effects, decrease total consumption of sufentanil and the incidence of adverse effects, and thus facilitate patients' early recovery."
"3331","0","Psychedelics in psychopharmacotherapy.^\nAfter a hiatus of many years the interest in psychedelic substances in clinical application as well as in neurobiological and psychotherapy research is rising again. Classical psychedelics primarily act via the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor and induce characteristic alterations in sensory perception, social-, emotion-, and self-processing. They include lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin, and ayahuasca. Other consciousness-altering substances with different modes of action are called atypical psychedelics and comprise ketamine and laughing gas (N2O) among others. The ketamine enantiomer esketamine has been granted international approval for treatment-resistant depression. Further randomized, controlled phase II trials show promising results in the treatment of unipolar depression especially for psilocybin but also for N2O and ayahuasca. The new paradigm of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy suggests a therapeutic framework in which a safely conducted psychedelic experience is integrated into a continuous psychotherapeutic process. This narrative review provides an overview over the clinically relevant psychedelic substances and their neurobiological and psychic mechanisms of action. If classical and atypical psychedelics will be able to fulfill their expectations and find their way into broader clinical use, will depend on future rigorous clinical trials with larger sample sizes."
"7268","1","Effects of dose, sex, and long-term abstention from use on toxic effects of MDMA (ecstasy) on brain serotonin neurons.^\nBackground: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug that has been shown to damage brain serotonin neurons in high doses. However, effects of moderate MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been studied, and sex differences and the long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons have not been identified. We investigated the effects of moderate and heavy MDMA use, sex differences, and long-term effects of MDMA use on serotonin neurons in different brain regions. Methods: By means of flyers posted in ""rave"" venues in Amsterdam, the Netherlands, we recruited 15 moderate MDMA users, 23 heavy MDMA users, 16 ex-MDMA users who had stopped using MDMA for more than 1 year, and 15 controls who claimed never to have used MDMA. We studied the effects of MDMA on brain serotonin neurons using 123iodine-2β-carbomethoxy-3β-(4-iodophenyl) tropane ([123I]β-CIT) - a radioligand that binds with high affinity to serotonin transporters. Density of binding (expressed as a ratio of region-of-interest binding over binding in the cerebellum) was calculated by single-photon-emission computed tomography (SPECT). Findings:CT). Findings: We saw significant effects of group and group by sex (p=0.041 and p=0.022, respectively) on overall [123I]β-CIT binding ratios. In heavy MDMA users, significant decreases in overall binding ratios were seen in women (p<0.01) but not men (p=0.587). In female ex-MDMA users, overall densities of serotonin transporters were significantly higher than in heavy MDMA users (p=0.004), but not higher than in controls (p=0.524). Interpretation: Our results indicate that heavy use of MDMA is associated with neurotoxic effects on serotonin neurons, that women might be more susceptible than men, and that MDMA-induced neurotoxic changes in several brain regions of female ex-MDMA users are reversible."
"2997","0","Comments on Cooper et al’s review on strategies to mitigate dissociative and psychotomimetic effects from ketamine when used as a fast-acting antidepressant.^\nComments on an article by M. D. Cooper et al. (see record [rid]2017-34203-002[/rid]). The authors have a number of comments on Cooper et al.’s recent review on strategies to mitigate dissociative and psychotomimetic effects from ketamine when used as a fast- acting antidepressant. When administered acutely, there is a clear dose-response in terms of side effects, with higher doses having a higher likelihood of reporting side effects, and/or greater intensity of side effects. The time at which maximal side effects are reported coincides with peak blood concentrations. This raises a potential problem – dose-sparing strategies that might minimize dissociative or psychotomimetic side effects, might also be less effective clinically. The topic explored in this article may only be relevant to acute dosing, and less of an issue with repeated ketamine dosing. We have previously reported that the intensity of dissociative and psychotomimetic side effects diminished with repeated (weekly) dosing, although antidepressant efficacy was maintained and have also noticed this in long term clinical use. The trade-offs between tolerability and efficacy in the short and longer term will require head-to- head randomized trials that are adequately powered for both efficacy and safety – this is relevant to comparison of ketamine doses and also comparing off-the-shelf ketamine to other formulations or other NMDA antagonists.

"3930","0","Computerized cerebral biopotentials in the discovery of psychotropic drugs.^\nQuantitative pharmaco electroencephalography is a process involving the use of digital computer analyzed scalp recorded cerebral biopotentials as well as a series of statistical procedures for establishing the central effect of a new compound in humans, predicting its clinical (psychiatric) usefulness, and estimating its effective dosage range, as well as onset and duration of effects, all after a single oral dose. Although a conventional EEG consists of recorded cerebral activity, only 3 of 22 measurements of the computer analysis which are used for the statistical differentiation of psychotropic drugs, are comparable with the activities considered for clinical electroencephalography. Using quantitative pharmaco EEG the author has, in the past, predicted minor or major tranquillizer or thymoleptic effects of a series of compounds. Although the clinical trials confirmed the prediction of quantitative pharmaco EEG, the findings had limited value as the clinical profiles of the drugs given for investigation had already been predicted, based on animal pharmacology. Just recently, however, the thymoleptic properties of a new compound (GB 94, N.V. Organon) were predicted, which did not have pharmacological or biochemical properties of the existing antidepressive compounds and, accordingly, was not predicted by animal pharmacology to be a psychotropic drug. Clinical trials confirmed the prediction. Thus, GB 94 became the first psychotropic drug discovered based on an EEG model alone. The investigations indicated that computer analyses of cerebral biopotentials, particularly of relatively high frequency waves, are important parameters which reveal characteristic changes with different psychotropic drugs and with different dosages of the same compound. Accordingly, the study of computerized cerebral biopotentials is an extremely useful technique in defining the bioavailability of psychotropic drugs and in determining dose response curves."

Prior to this study, we conducted a dose-escalation study and identified 6 mg/kg as a potentially optimal initial dose of intranasal ketamine.Objective: To assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine at a dose of 6 mg/kg for procedural sedation to repair lacerations with sutures in children in the emergency department.Methods: We conducted a single-arm, open-label multicenter clinical trial for intranasal ketamine for laceration repair with sutures in children aged 1 to 12 years. A convenience sample of 30 patients received 6 mg/kg of in-tranasal ketamine for their procedural sedation. The primary outcome was the proportion (95% CI) of patients who achieved an effective procedural sedation.Results: We recruited 30 patients from April 2018 to December 2019 in two pediatric emergency departments in Canada. Lacerations repaired were mostly facial in 21(70%) patients and longer than 2 cm in 20 (67%) patients. Sedation was effective in 18/30 (60% [95% CI 45, 80]) children and was suboptimal in 5 (17%) patients but pro-cedure was completed in them with minimal difficulties. Sedation was poor in the remaining 7 (23%) patients, with 3 (10%) of them required additional sedative agents. No serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: Using a single dose of 6 mg/kg of intranasal Ketamine for laceration repair led to successful sedation in 60% of patients according to our a priori definition. An additional 17% of patients were considered suboptimal, but their procedure was still completed with minimal difficulty.Clinical trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03053947).(c) 2023 Published by Elsevier Inc."
"2473","1","Depressive symptomatology in young adults with a history of MDMA use: A longitudinal analysis.^\nResearch suggests that methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)/'ecstasy' can cause serotonin depletion as well as serotonergic neurodegradation that may result in depression. This longitudinal study used the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II) to assess depressive symptomatology every six months over a two-year period among a community sample of young adult MDMA/'ecstasy' users (n = 402). Multilevel growth modeling was used to analyze changes in BDI scores. Between baseline and 24 months, the mean BDI score declined from 9.8 to 7.7. Scores varied significantly across individuals at baseline and declined at a rate of 0.36 points every six months. Persons with higher baseline scores were more likely to have their scores decrease over time. Several factors were significantly associated with score levels, independent of time: gender - men's scores were lower than women's; ethnicity - whites' scores were lower than those of non-whites; education - persons with at least some university education had scores that were lower than those without any college experience; benzodiazepines - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; opioids - current users' scores were higher than non-users'; and cumulative ecstasy use - people who had used MDMA more than 50 times had scores that were higher than persons who had used the drug less often. The results reported here show low levels of depressive symptoms among a sample that, after 24 months, consisted of both current and former MDMA users. The low and declining mean scores suggest that for most people MDMA/'ecstasy' use does not result in long-term depressive symptomatology. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology."

Yet, how single and repeated ketamine treatment induces brain systems-level neuroplasticity underlying symptom improvement is unknown. Advanced multiband imaging (MB) pseudo-continuous arterial spin labeling (pCASL) perfusion MRI data was acquired from patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD) (N = 22, mean age=35.2 ± 9.95 SD, 27% female) at baseline, and 24 h after receiving single, and four subanesthetic (0.5 mg/kg) intravenous ketamine infusions. Changes in global and regional CBF were compared across time points, and relationships with overall mood, anhedonia and apathy were examined. Comparisons between patients at baseline and controls (N = 18, mean age=36.11 ± 14.5 SD, 57% female) established normalization of treatment effects. Results showed increased regional CBF in the cingulate and primary and higher-order visual association regions after first ketamine treatment. Baseline CBF in the fusiform, and acute changes in CBF in visual areas were related to symptom improvement after single and repeated ketamine treatment, respectively. In contrast, after serial infusion therapy, decreases in regional CBF were observed in the bilateral hippocampus and right insula with ketamine treatment. Findings demonstrate that neurophysiological changes occurring with single and repeated ketamine treatment follow both a regional and temporal pattern including sensory and limbic regions. Initial changes are observed in the posterior cingulate and precuneus and primary and higher-order visual areas, which relate to clinical responses. However, repeated exposure to ketamine, though not relating to clinical outcome, appears to engage deeper limbic structures and insula. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved)"

RECENT FINDINGS: Psilocybin has a large, rapid, and persistent clinical effect in the treatment of resistant or end-of-life depression. Tolerance is good, with mild side effects limited to a few hours after dosing. The studies conducted to date have had small sample sizes. One clinical trial has been conducted against a reference treatment (escitalopram) without showing a significant superiority of psilocybin in the main outcome. The neurobiological mechanisms, mostly unknown, differ from those of SSRI antidepressants. Psilocybin represents a promising alternative in the treatment of depression. Further research with larger sample sizes, particularly against reference treatments, is needed to better understand the neurobiological factors of its effects and to investigate its potential for use in everyday practice."

The study was done in collaboration with the Spanish Traffic Police, in Galicia (NW Spain), during 2004 and 2005. A total of 468 drivers selected at the police controls agreed to participate through informed consent. In addition, saliva samples were collected and sent to the laboratory to confirm the on-site results. For this purpose, two different analytical liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) methods were used to detect 11 drugs or metabolites in a 300 microL sample. Simultaneous analysis of morphine, 6-acetylmorphine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA, MDEA, MBDB, cocaine and benzoylecgonine was carried out using 100 microL of oral fluid, after an automated solid phase extraction. A different LC-MS method was performed to detect Delta(9)-THC in 200 microL of oral fluid using liquid-liquid extraction with hexane at pH 6. Both methods were fully validated, including linearity (1-250 ng/mL, 2-250 ng/mL) recovery (>50%), within-day and between-day precision (CV<15%), accuracy (mean relative error<15%), limit of detection (0.5 and 1 ng/mL), quantitation (1 and 2 ng/mL) and matrix effect. All of the positive cases and a random selection of 30% of the negatives were analyzed for confirmation analysis. Good results (sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, positive predictive value and negative predictive value>90%) were obtained for cocaine and opiates by OraLab, and for cocaine by Dräger. However, the results for the other compounds could be improved for both detection devices. Differences in the ease of use and in the interpretation mode (visual or instrumental) were observed."
"5315","1","Psilocybin microdosing does not affect emotion-related symptoms and processing: A preregistered field and lab-based study.^\nBACKGROUND: Microdoses of psychedelics (i.e. a sub-hallucinogenic dose taken every third day) can reduce symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress according to anecdotal reports and observational studies. Research with medium to high doses of psilocybin points towards potential underlying mechanisms, including the modulation of emotion and interoceptive processing. AIMS: In this preregistered study, we investigated whether psilocybin microdoses alter self-reported interoceptive awareness and whether repeated microdosing over 3 weeks modulates emotion processing and reduces symptoms of anxiety and depression. METHODS: We used a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject crossover design. Participants completed the Multidimensional Assessment of Interoceptive Awareness Questionnaire 1½ h after self-administering their second dose (or placebo), and the emotional go/no-go task and the shortened Depression Anxiety Stress Scale 1½ h after self-administering their seventh dose. RESULTS: Our confirmatory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect emotion processing or symptoms of anxiety and depression compared with placebo. Our exploratory analyses revealed that psilocybin microdosing did not affect self-reported interoceptive awareness, that symptoms of depression and stress were significantly reduced in the first block compared with baseline, that participants broke blind in the second block and that there was no effect of expectations. Further research in a substance-naïve population with clinical range anxiety and depressive symptoms is needed to substantiate the potential beneficial effects of microdosing."

"869","1","Procedural and declarative memory task performance, and the memory consolidation function of sleep, in recent and abstinent ecstasy/MDMA users.^\nEcstasy/MDMA use has been associated with various memory deficits. This study assessed declarative and procedural memory in ecstasy/MDMA users. Participants were tested in two sessions, 24 h apart, so that the memory consolidation function of sleep on both types of memory could also be assessed. Groups were: drug-naive controls (n = 24); recent ecstasy/MDMA users, who had taken ecstasy/MDMA 2-3 days before the first testing session (n = 25), and abstinent users, who had not taken ecstasy/MDMA for at least 8 days before testing (n = 17). Procedural memory did not differ between groups, but greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy was associated with poorer procedural memory. Recent ecstasy/MDMA users who had taken other drugs (mainly cannabis) 48-24 h before testing exhibited poorer declarative memory than controls, but recent users who had not taken other drugs in this 48-24-h period did not differ from controls. Greater lifetime consumption of ecstasy, and of cocaine, were associated with greater deficits in declarative memory. These results suggest that procedural, as well as declarative, memory deficits are associated with the extent of past ecstasy use. However, ecstasy/MDMA did not affect the memory consolidation function of sleep for either the declarative or the procedural memory task. © The Author(s) 2010."
"387","1","N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist effects on prefrontal cortical connectivity better model early than chronic schizophrenia.^\nBACKGROUND: Prefrontal cortex (PFC) function contributes to schizophrenia onset and progression. However, little is known about neural mechanisms behind PFC functional alterations along illness stages. Recent pharmacologic studies indicate that glutamate dysfunction may produce increased functional connectivity. However, pharmacologic models of schizophrenia overlook effects of illness progression on PFC function. This study compared N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist effects in healthy volunteers with stages of schizophrenia with respect to PFC functional connectivity. METHODS: First, we tested ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity in healthy volunteers in a data-driven way (n = 19). Next, we compared healthy subjects (n = 96) with three clinical groups: individuals at high risk for schizophrenia (n = 21), people early in their course of schizophrenia (EC-SCZ) (n = 28), and patients with chronic illness (n = 20). Across independent analyses, we used data-driven global brain connectivity techniques restricted to PFC to identify functional dysconnectivity. RESULTS: Results revealed robust PFC hyperconnectivity in healthy volunteers administered ketamine (Cohen's d = 1.46), resembling individuals at high risk for schizophrenia and EC-SCZ. Hyperconnectivity was not found in patients with chronic illness relative to EC-SCZ patients. Results provide the first evidence that ketamine effects on PFC functional connectivity resemble early course but not chronic schizophrenia. CONCLUSIONS: Results suggest an illness phase-specific relevance of NMDAR antagonist administration for prefrontal dysconnectivity associated with schizophrenia. This finding has implications for the neurobiology of illness progression and for the widespread use of NMDAR antagonists in the development of therapeutics for schizophrenia."
"2751","1","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine quantification via benchtop 1H qNMR spectroscopy: Method validation and its application to ecstasy tablets collected at music festivals.^\nWe describe a method validation for the quantification of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in tablets based on the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) guideline for quantitative Nuclear Magnetic Resonance analysis (qNMR). qNMR experiments were carried out on a 60 MHz benchtop NMR spectrometer employing ethylene carbonate as an internal calibrant. A series of ‘ecstasy’ tablets seized at music events were quantified and the results discussed regarding their within-batch variation and yearly median dose. The method showed good specificity and selectivity, with linearity, precision, accuracy, and recovery well within the UNODC recommended criteria. The limit of detection and quantification are 0.33 mg/mL and 0.10 mg/mL respectively, proving the method works well on small amounts of MDMA. Overall, the lowest amount of MDMA free base detected in this study was 9.35 mg in a piperazine mix, while the highest dosed tablet contained 237.55 mg MDMA free base, with a 9.1% decrease in median amount compared to the pre-pandemic data (2019), but still higher than the data collected in a previous study (105 mg median amount of MDMA free base in 2018). The within-batch variation was insignificant for one of the seizures but showed greater variation for the other, which confirmed that the MDMA content of a single tablet may not reflect that of the whole batch. This dynamic upward change in tablet dosage highlights the importance of ongoing trend monitoring and specific prevention intervention to counteract the negative consequences associated with MDMA use. Benchtop NMR has been successfully employed in quality control, material science and more recently, drug analysis. The present study demonstrates its beneficial application in forensic science overcoming the limitations of currently available instruments and techniques employed in harm reduction and field testing."
"1094","1","Stereospecific analysis of ecstasy-like N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine and its metabolites in humans.^\nA chiral HPLC method has been developed for the ecstasy analogue (R,S)-N-ethyl-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDE) and its metabolites o-glucuronyl-(R,S)-N-ethyl-4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HME) and (R,S)-3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) in human plasma. The chiral discrimination of the compounds was carried out with an enantioselective HPLC method using beta-cyclodextrin in the mobile phase for MDE and MDA and a chiral protein phase (chiral-CBH) for HME. MDE and MDA were detected fluorimetrically at 322 nm, while the major metabolite HME was selectively determined by electrochemical detection at +600 mV. After hydrolysis of the conjugates using beta-glucuronidase/arylsulfatase and solid-phase extraction with a cation-exchange phase for sample preparation high recovery rates of more than 95% were yielded. The limit of quantitation for the enantiomers of MDE and its metabolites in plasma were between 1.2 (MDA) and 16 ng/ml (HME) and the relative method standard deviations (V(xO), Table 1) were less than 3%. The methods described have been used successfully in the enantioselective quantitation of the compounds in plasma samples obtained from six healthy volunteers in a clinical study after oral administration of 140 mg racemic MDE hydrochloride. Significant differences were found in the plasma concentrations of the examined stereoisomers. Whereas the R-enantiomer of the parent substance, MDE, was predominant in the plasma samples investigated, higher plasma concentrations of the S-enantiomers of the metabolites MDA and HME were measured."
"7619","0","Lanicemine: a low-trapping NMDA channel blocker produces sustained antidepressant efficacy with minimal psychotomimetic adverse effects.^\nKetamine, an N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate receptor (NMDAR) channel blocker, has been found to induce rapid and robust antidepressant‐like effects in rodent models and in treatment‐refractory depressed patients. However, the marked acute psychological side effects of ketamine complicate the interpretation of both preclinical and clinical data. Moreover, the lack of controlled data demonstrating the ability of ketamine to sustain the antidepressant response with repeated administration leaves the potential clinical utility of this class of drugs in question. Using quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) to objectively align doses of a low‐trapping NMDA channel blocker, AZD6765 (lanicemine), to that of ketamine, we demonstrate the potential for NMDA channel blockers to produce antidepressant efficacy without psychotomimetic and dissociative side effects. Furthermore, using placebo‐controlled data, we show that the antidepressant response to NMDA channel blockers can be maintained with repeated and intermittent drug administration. Together, these data provide a path for the development of novel glutamatergic‐based therapeutics for treatment‐refractory mood disorders."
"684","0","Ketamine treatment for depression: A model of care.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine and related compounds are emerging as rapidly acting therapies for treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine differs from standard antidepressants in its speed of action, specific acute and cumulative side effects, risk of dependence and regulatory requirements. However, there is currently little guidance offering translation from research studies into clinical practice. We therefore detail a comprehensive model of care for ketamine treatment of depression. METHOD: We formulated a set of policies and procedures for a 'compassionate use' ketamine programme that developed out of our clinical research in ketamine. These policies and procedures were formulated into a detailed model of care. RESULTS: The current Australian and New Zealand regulatory frameworks and professional bodies' recommendations regarding ketamine are detailed along with clinical governance and infrastructure considerations. We next describe a four-step model comprising initial assessment, pre-treatment, treatment and post-treatment phases. The model comprises thorough psychiatric and medical assessments examining patient suitability, a rigorous consenting process and structured safety monitoring across an acute treatment course or maintenance therapy. Our ketamine dose-titration method is detailed allowing flexible dosing of patients across a treatment course enabling individualised treatment. CONCLUSION: The model of care aims to bridge the gap between efficacy studies and clinical care outside of research settings as ketamine and related compounds become increasingly important therapies for treatment-resistant depression."

Little research has experimentally examined how session ""set and setting"" impacts subjective and therapeutic effects. We analyzed the effects of the musical genre played during sessions of a psilocybin study for tobacco smoking cessation. Participants (N = 10) received psilocybin (20-30 mg/70 kg) in two sessions, each with a different musical genre (Western classical versus overtone-based), with the order counterbalanced. Participants chose one genre for a third session (30 mg/70 kg). Mystical experiences scores tended to be higher in overtone-based sessions than in Western classical sessions. Six of ten participants chose the overtone-based music for a third session. Biologically confirmed smoking abstinence was similar based on musical choice, with a slight benefit for participants choosing the overtone-based playlist (66.7% versus 50%). These data call into question whether Western classical music typically used in psychedelic therapy holds a unique benefit. Broadly, we call for experimentally examining session components toward optimizing psychedelic therapeutic protocols."

Method: Data were drawn from a high-risk family study of alcohol use disorder of mothers and their offspring (N = 735). Multinomial regressions were used to examine whether experience of offspring and maternal gender discrimination were associated with offspring illicit drug use (cannabis, cocaine, ecstasy, PCP, opiates, hallucinogens, solvents, sedatives, or inhalants). Outcomes included offspring age of drug use initiation (age ≤ 14) and lifetime heavy drug use (≥ 50 times) of 1 or more illicit substances. Interactions between race and offspring gender discrimination were modeled to assess for race differences. Results: Results revealed that gender discrimination was associated with a greater likelihood of offspring early initiation (relative risk ratio [RRR] = 2.57, 95% CI [1.31, 5.03]) versus later initiation (RRR = 1.33, 95% CI [0.80, 2.24]). Offspring gender discrimination was associated with offspring heavy drug use (RRR = 2.09, 95% CI [1.07, 4.06]) and not associated with moderate/light use (RRR = 1.44, 95% CI [0.86, 2.42]), but post hoc tests revealed no significant group differences. Conclusions: Findings suggest that perceived offspring gender discrimination is associated with early drug use initiation. Gender discrimination, particularly at an early age, has a potential to cause harm, including drug use. Implementation of policies that foster environments that eliminate gender bias and discrimination at an early age should be prioritized. Gender-responsive treatment merits consideration by substance use treatment providers. Public Significance Statement: This study indicates that adolescent females who experience gender discrimination, are more likely to initiate drugs at an earlier age. Targeting gender discrimination during adolescence may be important, before gender norms become rooted into one’s trajectory. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"

"6200","1","Effects of LSD on Neuroplasticity in Healthy Subjects.^\nNeuroplasticity is the brain's ability to reorganize itself and adapt in response to changing environmental conditions or pathological stimuli. Its dysregulation may play a role in the etiology of depression and anxiety disorders, and it is also essential for recovery from neural injury and stroke. LSD is a potent psychedelic drug and a member of the psychoplastogen family of small molecules, which are able to rapidly stimulate neuroplasticity in cortical neurons following a single dose. Previous research suggests that changes in neuroplasticity may contribute to LSD's long‐term effects, which include increases in subjective well‐being and life satisfaction, reduced anxiety, and increased openness to experience. Additionally, there is some evidence that LSD and other psychedelics could be viable clinical treatments for depression, anxiety, and addictive disorders, and that changes in neuroplasticity may underlie this clinical potential. However, there is still little direct evidence that LSD or other psychoplastogens enhance cortical plasticity in humans. The goal of this study is to investigate the effects of LSD on several measures of neuroplasticity in healthy human subjects, as well as other abilities and traits thought to be related to neuroplasticity. Determining whether LSD enhances cortical plasticity, how long this may last, where in the brain it occurs, and what it means for cognition and emotion is essential for understanding LSD's long‐term effects, including but not limited to its clinical potential."
"8434","1","Persistent nigrostriatal dopaminergic abnormalities in ex-users of MDMA (ecstasy): An 18F-dopa PET Study.^\nEcstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA) is a popular recreational drug with known serotonergic neurotoxicity. Its long-term effects on dopaminergic function are less certain. Studying the long-term effects of ecstasy is often confounded by concomitant polydrug use and the short duration of abstinence. We used 18F-dopa positron emission tomography (PET) to investigate the long-term effects of ecstasy on nigrostriatal dopaminergic function in a group of male ex-recreational users of ecstasy who had been abstinent for a mean of 3.22 years. We studied 14 ex-ecstasy users (EEs), 14 polydrug-using controls (PCs) (matched to the ex-users for other recreational drug use), and 12 drug-naive controls (DCs). Each participant underwent one 18F-dopa PET, cognitive assessments, and hair and urinary analyses to corroborate drug-use history. The putamen 18F-dopa uptake of EEs was 9% higher than that of DCs (p=0.021). The putamen uptake rate of PCs fell between the other two groups, suggesting that the hyperdopaminergic state in EEs may be due to the combined effects of ecstasy and polydrug use. There was no relationship between the amount of ecstasy used and striatal 18 F-dopa uptake. Increased putaminal 18 F-dopa uptake in EEs after an abstinence of 3 years (mean) suggests that the effects are long lasting. Our findings suggest potential long-term effects of ecstasy use, in conjunction with other recreational drugs, on nigrostriatal dopaminergic functions. Further longitudinal studies are required to elucidate the significance of these findings as they may have important public health implications. © 2011 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"2941","0","The Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program: An Update on Unipolar Nonpsychotic Depression.^\nBackground The Psychopharmacology Algorithm Project at the Harvard South Shore Program presents evidence-based recommendations considering efficacy, tolerability, safety, and cost. Two previous algorithms for unipolar nonpsychotic depression were published in 1993 and 1998. New studies over the last 20 years suggest that another update is needed. Methods The references reviewed for the previous algorithms were reevaluated, and a new literature search was conducted to identify studies that would either support or alter the previous recommendations. Other guidelines and algorithms were consulted. We considered exceptions to the main algorithm, as for pregnant women and patients with anxious distress, mixed features, or common medical and psychiatric comorbidities. Summary For inpatients with severe melancholic depression and acute safety concerns, electroconvulsive therapy (or ketamine if ECT refused or ineffective) may be the first-line treatment. In the absence of an urgent indication, we recommend trialing venlafaxine, mirtazapine, or a tricyclic antidepressant. These may be augmented if necessary with lithium or T3 (triiodothyronine). For inpatients with non-melancholic depression and most depressed outpatients, sertraline, escitalopram, and bupropion are reasonable first choices. If no response, the prescriber (in collaboration with the patient) has many choices for the second trial in this algorithm because there is no clear preference based on evidence, and there are many individual patient considerations to take into account. If no response to the second medication trial, the patient is considered to have a medication treatment-resistant depression. If the patient meets criteria for the atypical features specifier, a monoamine oxidase inhibitor could be considered. If not, reconsider (for the third trial) some of the same options suggested for the second trial. Some other choices can also considered at this stage. If the patient has comorbidities such as chronic pain, obsessive-compulsive disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, or posttraumatic stress disorder, the depression could be secondary; evidence-based treatments for those disorders would then be recommended."
"2659","0","The concept and management of acute episodes of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder: a systematic review and exploratory meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials.^\nBACKGROUND: The definitions of treatment-resistant bipolar disorder (TRBD) have varied across studies. Additionally, its management is clinically challenging. An updated synthesis and appraisal of the available evidence is needed. METHODS: A systematic search of major electronic databases from inception up to May 25th, 2020, was conducted to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions for the management of TRBD. When sufficient evidence was available, a meta-analysis was conducted. RESULTS: Seventeen studies (n = 928 patients) were included in the qualitative synthesis. Fourteen studies (n = 803) assessed treatment-resistant acute bipolar depression (TRBD-De), including five neuromodulatory and nine pharmacological trials. Rapid- vs. standard up-titration of clozapine showed promising efficacy for TRBD mania, without significant adverse events. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) was confirmed to be similarly effective for TRBD-De as for treatment-resistant unipolar depression: odd ratio, OR = 0.919 (95%C.I. = 0.44-1.917), I(2) = 13.98, p = .822. TRBD-De patients exposed to ketamine at day one post-infusion had high odds of response: OR = 10.682 (95%C.I. = 2.142-53.272), I(2) = 0, p = <.005. The pooled drop-out rate in the ketamine trials was 21.2%. Additional evidence is warranted to confirm the potential efficacy of pramipexole or stimulants for TRBD-De. LIMITATIONS: Publication/measurement bias; exploratory nature of the meta-analyses for interventions that included participants solely with TRBD-De. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, a few interventions are available for TRBD, including pramipexole, ECT, and clozapine, among others. Larger and better-designed trials for TRBD are warranted and should be based on more uniform operational definitions. PROSPERO registration number: CRD42018114567."
"2205","1","The Effects of Daytime Psilocybin Administration on Sleep: Implications for Antidepressant Action.^\nSerotonergic agonist psilocybin is a psychedelic with antidepressant potential. Sleep may interact with psilocybin's antidepressant properties like other antidepressant drugs via induction of neuroplasticity. The main aim of the study was to evaluate the effect of psilocybin on sleep architecture on the night after psilocybin administration. Regarding the potential antidepressant properties, we hypothesized that psilocybin, similar to other classical antidepressants, would reduce rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and prolong REM sleep latency. Moreover, we also hypothesized that psilocybin would promote slow-wave activity (SWA) expression in the first sleep cycle, a marker of sleep-related neuroplasticity. Twenty healthy volunteers (10 women, age 28-53) underwent two drug administration sessions, psilocybin or placebo, in a randomized, double-blinded design. Changes in sleep macrostructure, SWA during the first sleep cycle, whole night EEG spectral power across frequencies in non-rapid eye movement (NREM) and REM sleep, and changes in subjective sleep measures were analyzed. The results revealed prolonged REM sleep latency after psilocybin administration and a trend toward a decrease in overall REM sleep duration. No changes in NREM sleep were observed. Psilocybin did not affect EEG power spectra in NREM or REM sleep when examined across the whole night. However, psilocybin suppressed SWA in the first sleep cycle. No evidence was found for sleep-related neuroplasticity, however, a different dosage, timing, effect on homeostatic regulation of sleep, or other mechanisms related to antidepressant effects may play a role. Overall, this study suggests that potential antidepressant properties of psilocybin might be related to changes in sleep."
"5840","0","Psychedelic-induced mystical experiences: An interdisciplinary discussion and critique.^\nContemporary research on serotonergic psychedelic compounds has been rife with references to so-called 'mystical' subjective effects. Several psychometric assessments have been used to assess such effects, and clinical studies have found quantitative associations between 'mystical experiences' and positive mental health outcomes. The nascent study of psychedelic-induced mystical experiences, however, has only minimally intersected with relevant contemporary scholarship from disciplines within the social sciences and humanities, such as religious studies and anthropology. Viewed from the perspective of these disciplines-which feature rich historical and cultural literatures on mysticism, religion, and related topics-'mysticism' as used in psychedelic research is fraught with limitations and intrinsic biases that are seldom acknowledged. Most notably, existing operationalizations of mystical experiences in psychedelic science fail to historicize the concept and therefore fail to acknowledge its perennialist and specifically Christian bias. Here, we trace the historical genesis of the mystical in psychedelic research in order to illuminate such biases, and also offer suggestions toward more nuanced and culturally-sensitive operationalizations of this phenomenon. In addition, we argue for the value of, and outline, complementary 'non-mystical' approaches to understanding putative mystical-type phenomena that may help facilitate empirical investigation and create linkages to existing neuro-psychological constructs. It is our hope that the present paper helps build interdisciplinary bridges that motivate fruitful paths toward stronger theoretical and empirical approaches in the study of psychedelic-induced mystical experiences."

When verbal deescalation fails, they often require physical restraint, chemical restraint, or seclusion. Objective: To determine the success rate of verbal de‐escalation for agitated patients presenting to the emergency department (ED). Methods: This was a cross‐sectional study at an urban, Level 1 Trauma Center with 108,000 annual visits. Data collection was performed by trained research associates. We prospectively screened all patients in the ED for agitation during a randomized distribution of 440 8‐hour shifts totaling 3,520 hours over a 20‐month period. All patients were assessed using the altered mental status score (AMS), a validated 9 point scale ranging from unresponsive (‐4) to normal (0) to severely agitated (+4). Patients with an AMS score of >1 were considered agitated. Verbal de‐escalation is the initial approach for all agitated patients presented to this ED. Verbal de‐escalation was considered successful if the patient did not require the use of physical or chemical restraint, or seclusion. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics. Results: 43,848 patients were screened, 1,146 (2.6%) had an agitation score >1. The median agitation score on presentation was 2.79, range 2 to 4. Verbal deesclation alone was successful for up to the initial hour of treatment in 32% of patients, and adequate for the duration of their care in the ED in 10.6% of patients. Physical restrains were used in 44.3% of patients, parenteral medication was used to treat agitation in 56.1% (42% Olanzapine, 26% Droperidol, 22% haloperidol, 5% Lorazepam, 4% Ketamine), 35.5% were treated with seclusion in a locked unit. 68% of agitated patients were determined to be primarily due to intoxication, 24% due to an exacerbation of psychiatric illness, and 8% due to some other medical condition. Conclusion: Verbal de‐escalation was sufficient to control agitation in 10.6% of patients presenting to the ED with agitation for the duration of their ED visit. 68% of agitated patients required parenteral medication, physical restraint, seclusion, or some combination of these in the first hour of their treatment. Further work to determine which situations are associated with successful verbal de‐escalation may result in more precise use of other interventions."
"6953","1","Determination of MDMA and its metabolites in blood and urine by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry and analysis of enantiomers by capillary electrophoresis.^\nA gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) method was used for the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and the 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) metabolites in plasma and urine samples after the administration of 100 mg MDMA to healthy volunteers. Samples were hydrolyzed prior to a solid-phase extraction with Bond Elut Certify columns. Analytes were eluted with ethyl acetate (2% ammonium hydroxide) and analyzed as their trifluoroacyl derivatives. Linear calibration curves were obtained at plasma and urine concentration ranges of 25-400 ng/mL and 250-2000 ng/mL for MDMA and HMMA, and of 2.5-40 ng/mL and 100-1000 ng/mL for MDA and HMA. Following the same urine preparation procedure but without the derivatization step, a capillary electrophoresis (CE) method for enantiomerical resolution of compounds was developed using (2-hydroxy)propyl-beta-cyclodextrin at two different concentrations (10 and 50mM in 50mM H3PO4, pH 2.5) as chiral selector. Calibration curves for the CE method were prepared with the corresponding racemic mixture and were linear between 125 and 2000 ng/mL, 50 and 1000 ng/mL, and 125 and 1500 ng/mL for each enantiomer of MDMA, MDA, and HMMA, respectively. Stereoselective disposition of MDMA and MDA was confirmed. HMMA disposition seems to be in apparent contradiction with MDMA findings as the enantiomer ratio is close to 1 and constant over the time."
"8038","1","Motor delays in MDMA (ecstasy) exposed infants persist to 2 years.^\nBackground: Recreational use of 3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy, MDMA) is increasing worldwide. Its use by pregnant women causes concern due to potentially harmful effects on the developing fetus. MDMA, an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor, affects the serotonin and dopamine systems. Preclinical studies of fetal exposure demonstrate effects on learning, motor behavior, and memory. In the first human studies, we found prenatal MDMA exposure related to poorer motor development in the first year of life. In the present study we assessed the effects of prenatal exposure to MDMA on the trajectory of child development through 2 years of age. We hypothesized that exposure would be associated with poorer mental and motor outcomes. Materials and Methods: The DAISY (Drugs and Infancy Study, 2003-2008) employed a prospective longitudinal cohort design to assess recreational drug use during pregnancy and child outcomes in the United Kingdom. Examiners masked to drug exposures followed infants from birth to 4, 12, 18, and 24 months of age. MDMA, cocaine, alcohol, tobacco, cannabis, and other drugs were quantified through a standardized clinical interview. The Bayley Scales (III) of Mental (MDI) and Motor (PDI) Development and the Behavior Rating Scales (BRS) were primary outcome measures. Statistical analyses included a repeated measures mixed model approach controlling for multiple confounders. Results: Participants were pregnant women volunteers, primarily white, of middle class socioeconomic status, average IQ, with some college education, in stable partner relationships. Of 96 women enrolled, children of 93 had at least one follow-up assessment and 81 (87%) had ≥ two assessments. Heavier MDMA exposure (= 1.3 ± 1.4 tablets per week) predicted lower PDI (< .002), and poorer BRS motor quality from 4 to 24 months of age, but did not affect MDI, orientation, or emotional regulation. Children with heavier exposure were twice as likely to demonstrate poorer motor quality as lighter and non-exposed children (O.R. = 2.2, 95%, CI = 1.02-4.70, p < .05). Discussion: Infants whose mothers reported heavier MDMA use during pregnancy had motor delays from 4 months to two years of age that were not attributable to other drug or lifestyle factors. Women of child bearing age should be cautioned about the use of MDMA and MDMA-exposed infants should be screened for motor delays and possible intervention."
"1230","0","Insights into the neurobiology of suicidality: explicating the role of glutamatergic systems through the lens of ketamine.^\nSuicidality is a prevalent mental health condition, and managing suicidal patients is one of the most challenging tasks for health care professionals due to the lack of rapid-acting, effective psychopharmacological treatment options. According to the literature, suicide has neurobiological underpinnings that are not fully understood, and current treatments for suicidal tendencies have considerable limitations. To treat suicidality and prevent suicide, new treatments are required; to achieve this, the neurobiological processes underlying suicidal behavior must be thoroughly investigated. Although multiple neurotransmitter systems, particularly serotonergic systems, have been studied in the past, less has been reported in relation to disruptions in glutamatergic neurotransmission, neuronal plasticity, and neurogenesis that result from stress-related abnormalities of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal system. Informed by the literature, which reports robust antisuicidal and antidepressive properties of subanaesthetic doses of ketamine, this review aims to provide an examination of the neurobiology of suicidality (and relevant mood disorders) with implications of pertinent animal, clinical, and postmortem studies. We discuss dysfunctions in the glutamatergic system, which may play a role in the neuropathology of suicidality and the role of ketamine in restoring synaptic connectivity at the molecular levels."
"6428","1","MDMA-related presentations to the emergency departments of the European Drug Emergencies Network plus (Euro-DEN Plus) over the four-year period 2014-2017.^\nCONTEXT: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) remains one of the most commonly used recreational drugs in Europe. Monitoring of Emergency Department (ED) presentations with acute toxicity associated with MDMA is important to determine trends in MDMA use and harms. METHODS: Data were extracted from the European Drug Emergencies Network (Euro-DEN) Plus database for all ED presentations with acute toxicity involving MDMA use, alone or in combination with other substances, between 1 January 2014 and 31 December 2017. Geographical distribution, time trends, patient demographics, clinical features, management and outcome were analysed. RESULTS: Out of 23,947 presentations, 2013 (8.4%) involved MDMA, used alone (88, 4.4%) or with other substances (1925, 95.6%). The proportion of MDMA presentations varied by country, from over 15% in France to less than 5% in Norway. For the 15 sentinel centres where data were available for all four years, MDMA-related presentations peaked in 2016 (10.4% versus 8.1% in 2015, p < 0.0001), thereafter decreasing in 2017 (8.2%, p = 0.0002). 1436 (71.3%) presentations involved males. Females were significantly younger than males (median 23 years, interquartile range, IQR, 20-27 years, versus median 25 years, IQR 21-30 years, p < 0.0001). Compared to presentations of acute toxicity with lone-use cocaine, presentations with lone-use MDMA occurred more frequently during the weekend (58.0% versus 43.9%, p = 0.02), were more frequently medically discharged directly from the ED (74.7% versus 62.4%, p = 0.03), and less frequently received sedation (43.5% versus 66.5%, p = 0.003). CONCLUSIONS: This large multicentre series of MDMA presentations to EDs showed geographical variation and changes in time trends and in patient demographics. Triangulation with data from complementary sources including seizures, prevalence of use and wastewater analysis, will enable a greater understanding of the public health implications of MDMA use in Europe."
"6085","1","Ibogaine in the Treatment of Alcoholism: a Randomized, Double-blind, Placebo-controlled, Escalating-dose, Phase 2 Trial.^\nApproximately 5% of the world's adult population has some alcohol‐related disorder, which in addition is associated with 3% of all deaths in the world. In Brazil, harmful use and dependence on alcohol reach about 10% of the population, with alcohol being one of the main factors of disease and mortality. Although the medications currently used have some efficacy, the adverse effects and relatively long time of treatment are factors that may reduce patients' motivation to continue taking the medication correctly. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct research with new drugs for the treatment of alcoholism. Ibogaine is an alkaloid present in the bush Tabernanthe iboga (iboga), a plant from Central Africa traditionally used in countries such as Gabon and Cameroon. Animal studies and case series suggest that one or a few doses of ibogaine significantly reduce withdrawal symptoms and the intensity of use of various drugs, including opioids, psychostimulants, and alcohol. However, there are no controlled clinical studies that have explored these effects. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the safety, tolerability and efficacy of increasing doses of ibogaine in 12 alcoholic patients. Each patient will be hospitalized for 20 days and receive 3 increasing doses of ibogaine. The first 3 patients will receive oral doses of 20 to 400 mg of ibogaine in an open‐label design. If the 3 higher doses (240, 320 and 400 mg) are well tolerated, the next 9 volunteers will receive these doses or placebo randomly. The volunteers will also be evaluated 7, 14 and 21 days and 1, 3, 6 and 12 months after leaving the hospital to monitor the consumption of alcohol and other drugs."

"7581","0","Developing a real-world evidence base for prescribed cannabis in the United Kingdom: preliminary findings from Project Twenty21.^\nThe therapeutic potential of medical cannabis to treat a variety of conditions is becoming increasingly recognised. Globally, a large number of countries have now legalised cannabis for medical uses and a substantial number of patients are able to access their medications. Yet in the UK, where medical cannabis was legalised in November 2018, only a handful of NHS prescriptions have been written, meaning that most patients are unable to access the medicine. Reasons for this are manyfold and include the perceived lack of clinical evidence due to the challenges of studying medical cannabis through randomised controlled trials. In order to develop the current evidence base, the importance of incorporating real-world data (RWD) to assess the effectiveness and efficacy of medical cannabis has gradually become recognised. The current paper provides a detailed outline of Project Twenty21 (T21), the UK's first medical cannabis registry, launched in August 2020. We provide the rationale for T21 and describe the methodology before reporting the characteristics of the 'first patients' enrolled in the registry. We describe the health status of all patients enrolled into the project during its first 7 months of operation and the sociodemographic characteristics and primary presenting conditions for these patients, as well as details of the medical cannabis prescribed to these individuals. By 12th March 2021, 678 people had been enrolled into T21; the majority (64%) were male and their average age was 38.7 years (range = 18-80). The most commonly reported primary conditions were chronic pain (55.6%) and anxiety disorders (32.0%) and they reported high levels of multi-morbidity, including high rates of insomnia and depression. We also present preliminary evidence from 75 patients followed up after 3 months indicating that receipt of legal, prescribed cannabis was associated with a significant increase in self-reported health, assessed using the visual analogue scale of the EQ-5D-5L (Cohen's d = .77, 95% CI = .51-1.03). Our initial findings complement reports from other large-scale databases globally, indicating that the current RWD is building up a pattern of evidence. With many clinicians demanding better and faster evidence to inform their decisions around prescribing medical cannabis, the current and future results of T21 will expand the existing evidence base on the effectiveness of cannabis-based medical products (CBMPs)."

"6742","0","The effects of ketamine on the minimum alveolar concentration of isoflurane in cats.^\nObjectives To determine the minimum alveolar concentration ( MAC) of isoflurane during the infusion of ketamine. Study design Prospective, experimental trial. Animals Twelve adult spayed female cats weighing 5.1 +/- 0.9 kg Methods Six cats were anesthetized with isoflurane in oxygen, intubated and attached to a circle-breathing system with mechanical ventilation. Catheters were placed in a peripheral vein for the infusion of fluids and ketamine, and the jugular vein for blood sampling for the measurement of ketamine concentrations. An arterial catheter was placed to allow blood pressure measurement and sampling for the measurement of PaCO2, PaO2 and pH. PaCO2 was maintained between 29 and 41 mmHg ( 3.9-5.5 kPa) and body temperature was kept between 37.8 and 39.3 degrees C. Following instrumentation, the MAC of isoflurane was determined in triplicate using a tail clamp method. A loading dose ( 2 mg kg(-1) over 5 minutes) and an infusion (23 mu g kg(-1) minute(-1)) of ketamine was started and MAC was redetermined starting 30 minutes later. Two further loading doses and infusions were used, 2 mg kg(-1) and 6 mg kg(-1) with 46 and 115 mu g kg(-1) minute(-1), respectively and MAC was redetermined. Cardiopulmonary measurements were taken before application of the noxious stimulus. The second group of six cats was used for the measurement of steady state plasma ketamine concentrations at each of the three infusion rates used in the initial study and the appropriate MAC value determined from the first study. Results The MAC decreased by 45 +/- 17%, 63 +/- 18%, and 75 +/- 17% at the infusion rates of 23, 46, and 115 mu g kg(-1) minute(-1). These infusion rates corresponded to ketamine plasma concentrations of 1.75 +/- 0.21, 2.69 +/- 0.40, and 5.36 +/- 1.19 mu g mL(-1). Arterial blood pressure and heart rate increased significantly with ketamine. Recovery was protracted. Conclusions and clinical relevance The MAC of isoflurane was significantly decreased by an infusion of ketamine and this was accompanied by an increase in heart rate and blood pressure. Because of the prolonged recovery in our cats, further work needs to be performed before using this in patients."
"7798","1","Urinary excretion kinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) and its phase I and phase II metabolites in humans following controlled MDMA administration.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is excreted inhuman urine as unchanged drug and phase I and II metabolites. Previous urinary excretion studies after controlled oral MDMA administration have been performed only after conjugate cleavage. Therefore, we investigated intact MDMA glucuronide and sulfate metabolite excretion. METHODS: We used LC-high-resolution MS and GC-MS to reanalyze blind urine samples from 10 participants receiving 1.0 or 1.6 mg/kg MDMA orally. We determined median C(max),t(max), first and last detection times, and total urinary recovery; calculated ratios of sulfates and glucuronides; and performed in vitro-in vivo correlations. RESULTS: Phase II metabolites of 3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine (DHMA),4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA),3,4-dihydroxyamphetamine (DHA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine were identified, although only DHMA sulfates, HMMA sulfate, and HMMA glucuronide had substantial abundance. Good correlation was observed for HMMA measured after acid hydrolysis and the sum of unconjugated HMMA, HMMA glucuronide, and HMMA sulfate (R(2) = 0.87). More than 90% of total DHMA and HMMA were excreted as conjugates. The analyte with the longest detection time was HMMA sulfate. Median HMMA sulfate/glucuronide and DHMA 3-sulfate/4-sulfate ratios for the first 24 h were 2.0 and 5.3, respectively, in accordance with previous in vitro calculations from human liver microsomes and cytosol experiments. CONCLUSIONS: Human MDMA urinary metabolites are primarily sulfates and glucuronides,with sulfates present in higher concentrations than glucuronides. This new knowledge may lead to improvements in urine MDMA and metabolite analysis in clinical and forensic toxicology, particularly for the performance of direct urine analysis."
"3002","1","Influence of formulation and route of administration on ketamine's safety and tolerability: systematic review.^\nPURPOSE: Ketamine has rapid-onset antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression. Common side effects include dissociation (a sense of detachment from reality) and increases in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. The objective of this structured review was to examine the effect of ketamine formulation and route of administration on its pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability, to identify formulation characteristics and routes of administration that might minimise side effects. METHODS: This was a structured review of published ketamine pharmacokinetics, safety and tolerability data for any ketamine formulation. The ratio of ketamine:norketamine was calculated from reported C(max) values, as a measure of first pass metabolism. The effect of formulation and route of administration on safety was evaluated by measuring mean changes in systolic blood pressure and tolerability by changes in dissociation ratings. Data were correlated using Spearman's method. RESULTS: A total of 41 treatment arms were identified from 21 publications, and included formulation development studies in healthy volunteers, and studies in clinical populations (patients undergoing anaesthesia, or being treated for pain or depression). Ketamine:norketamine ratios were strongly positively correlated with change in dissociation ratings (r = 0.89) and change in blood pressure (r = 0.96), and strongly negatively correlated with ketamine T(max) (r = - 0.87; p < 0.00001 for all). Ketamine T(max) strongly positively correlated with a change in dissociation ratings (r = - 0.96) and change in blood pressure (r = - 0.99; p < 0.00001 for all). CONCLUSION: Ketamine formulations that maximize first pass metabolism and delay T(max) will be better tolerated and safer than formulations which lack those characteristics."
"2032","0","The use of illicit drugs as self-medication in the treatment of cluster headache: Results from an Italian online survey.^\nBackground Cluster headache (CH) patients often receive unsatisfactory treatment and may explore illicit substances as alternatives. We aimed to explore this use of illicit drugs for CH treatment. Methods We invited CH patients from an Internet-based self-help group to complete a questionnaire regarding their therapeutic use of illicit substances. Results Of the 54 respondents, 29 were classified as chronic and 39 were drug-resistant cases. Fifty patients had previously tried subcutaneous sumatriptan, 40 had tried O2, and 48 had tried at least one prophylactic treatment. All 54 patients specified that they were dissatisfied with conventional treatments. Thirty-four patients had used cannabinoids, 13 cocaine, 8 heroin, 18 psilocybin, 12 lysergic acid amide (LSA), and 4 lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Discussion Some patients with intractable CH decided to try illicit drugs concomitantly with cessation of medical care. Most of these patients found suggestions for illicit drug use on the Internet. Many patients seemed to underestimate the judicial consequences of, and had an overestimated confidence in the safety of, such illicit treatments. Physicians are often not informed by patients of their choice to use illicit drugs. This leads to questions regarding the true nature of the physician-patient relationship among dissatisfied CH patients."
"6569","1","Shank3 as a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine and its neural correlates in bipolar depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Shank3, a post-synaptic density protein involved in N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor tethering and dendritic spine rearrangement, is implicated in the pathophysiology of bipolar disorder. We hypothesized that elevated baseline plasma Shank3 levels might predict antidepressant response to the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine. METHODS: Twenty-nine subjects with bipolar depression received a double-blind, randomized, subanesthetic dose (.5 mg/kg) ketamine infusion. Of the patients for whom Shank3 levels were collected, 15 completed baseline 3-Tesla MRI and 17 completed post-ketamine [(18)F]-FDG PET. RESULTS: Higher baseline Shank3 levels predicted antidepressant response at Days 1 (r=-.39, p=.047), 2 (r=-.45, p=.02), and 3 (r=-.42, p=.03) and were associated with larger average (r=.58, p=.02) and right amygdala volume (r=.65, p=.009). Greater baseline Shank3 also predicted increased glucose metabolism in the hippocampus (r=.51, p=.04) and amygdala (r=.58, p=.02). LIMITATIONS: Limitations include the small sample size, inability to assess the source of peripheral Shank3, and the lack of a placebo group for baseline Shank3 levels and comparative structural/functional neuroimaging. CONCLUSIONS: Shank3 is a potential biomarker of antidepressant response to ketamine that correlates with baseline amygdala volume and increased glucose metabolism in the amygdala and hippocampus."

OBJECTIVE: To compare depression rating outcomes with ketamine vs ECT in adults with MDE and to compare response and remission rates, number of sessions to response and remission, and adverse effects. DATA SOURCES: Two investigators independently systematically searched MEDLINE, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases using a combination of relevant Medical Subject Headings terms and free-text keywords from database inception through May 15, 2022, to identify relevant English-language trials. STUDY SELECTION: Parallel-group randomized clinical trials (RCTs). DATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two investigators independently extracted data and assessed risk of bias. One-week posttreatment outcomes were pooled as standardized mean difference (SMD; Hedges g) for continuous outcomes and risk ratio (RR) for categorical outcomes in random-effects meta-analyses. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Efficacy outcomes were 1-week (or nearest) posttreatment depression ratings, 1-week (or nearest) study-defined response and remission rates, and number of sessions to treatment response and remission. Safety outcomes were reported adverse effects. RESULTS: Five trials (ketamine group: n = 141; ECT group: n = 137) were meta-analyzed. The overall pooled SMD for posttreatment depression ratings was -0.39 (95% CI, -0.81 to 0.02; I2 = 45%; 5 RCTs). For this efficacy outcome, in a sensitivity analysis of methodologically stronger trials, ECT was superior to ketamine (SMD, -0.45; 95% CI, -0.75 to -0.14; I2 = 6%; 2 RCTs). ECT was also superior to ketamine for study-defined response (RR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.06-1.53; I2 = 0%; 3 RCTs) and remission (RR, 1.43; 95% CI, 1.12-1.82; I2 = 0%; 2 RCTs) rates. No significant differences were noted between groups for number of sessions to response and remission and for cognitive outcomes. Key limitations were small number of studies, limited sample size, and high risk of bias in all trials. CONCLUSION AND RELEVANCE: The findings of this systematic review and meta-analysis suggest an efficacy advantage for ECT over ketamine in adults with MDE. These conclusions are tempered by the small number and size of existing trials."
"5012","1","Exploring brain-derived neurotrophic factor Val66Met polymorphism and extinction learning–based treatment outcome in obsessive-compulsive disorder: A pilot study.^\nThis recent, open-label pilot study in unmedicated obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) subjects (N = 10) found that abbreviated CBT (10 one-hour exposure sessions), delivered during the 2 weeks when ketamine putatively facilitates extinction learning, helps individuals maintain ketamine-related improvement. To refine our understanding of the role of BDNF, we performed a secondary analysis to explore whether the BDNF Val66Met polymorphism is associated with treatment response to either exposure-based CBT or ketamine. Given the BDNF Met allele impairs activity-dependent BDNF secretion that is critical for extinction learning, we hypothesized that patients without the BDNF Met allele would have a better OCD outcome than BDNF Met allele carriers. In this first study examining the association between the BDNF Val66Met SNP and treatment response to ketamine and CBT in OCD, there were two main findings: (1) BDNF variation was not associated with acute ketamine response on the infusion day; (2) BDNF variation was associated with differential response rate to subsequent brief, two-week, exposure-based CBT.

METHODS: The ""Working with Addiction and Stress"" retreats combined four days of group counselling with two expert-led ayahuasca ceremonies. This study collected pre-treatment and six months follow-up data from 12 participants on several psychological and behavioral factors related to problematic substance use, and qualitative data assessing the personal experiences of the participants six months after the retreat. FINDINGS: Statistically significant (p < 0.05) improvements were demonstrated for scales assessing hopefulness, empowerment, mindfulness, and quality of life meaning and outlook subscales. Self-reported alcohol, tobacco and cocaine use declined, although cannabis and opiate use did not; reported reductions in problematic cocaine use were statistically significant. All study participants reported positive and lasting changes from participating in the retreats. CONCLUSIONS: This form of ayahuasca-assisted therapy appears to be associated with statistically significant improvements in several factors related to problematic substance use among a rural aboriginal population. These findings suggest participants may have experienced positive psychological and behavioral changes in response to this therapeutic approach, and that more rigorous research of ayahuasca-assisted therapy for problematic substance use is warranted."

"4112","1","A Systematic Review on the Efficacy of Intravenous Racemic Ketamine for Bipolar Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, has shown rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression. We conducted a systematic review of studies evaluating the efficacy of intravenous ketamine augmentation in treatment-resistant depression patients with bipolar disorder. METHODS: Major databases were searched for open-label and randomized controlled trials (RCT). Two independent reviewers screened and selected the studies that met the inclusion criteria. Studies were selected following the standard Cochrane methodology, and the findings are reported according to Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. Methodological quality of the included studies was assessed using standardized measures. RESULTS: A total of 1442 articles were screened. Five studies were included in the systematic review (3 RCTs and 2 open-label studies) enrolling 110 subjects (mean age, 45.54 ± 12.65 years; 68.18% female). All the RCTs and open-label studies showed improvement in depressions symptoms after receiving a single infusion of ketamine. Included studies also suggested improvement in suicidal ideation and anhedonia after ketamine infusion. Dissociation and transient increase in blood pressure were the most common reported adverse effects with ketamine. Ketamine infusions did not increase mania symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Limited data show efficacy and feasibility of intravenous racemic ketamine in treatment-resistant bipolar depression. Further studies with larger sample size are required to strengthen the evidence."
"5838","1","Acute Effects of Ketamine Infusion on Postoperative Mood Scores in Patients Undergoing Dilation and Curettage: A Randomized Double-Blind Controlled Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Emotional and psychological effects following abortion are more common than physical side effects and can range from mild regret to more serious complications such as depression. In the last decade, it has been suggested that low dose of ketamine is a fast-acting antidepressant. PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to investigate the impact of intraoperative ketamine infusion on postoperative mood score in patients undergoing Dilation and Curettage (D&C) under spinal anesthesia. We hypothesized that a single low-dose administration of ketamine infusion during D&C surgery can improve mood scores in the immediate postoperative period. METHODS: A prospective, randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled trial. The study included a total of 60 patients, ≥18 years, physical status ASA II, with up to 12-week gestation undergoing elective D&C surgery. Patients were divided randomly into a ketamine group (group K) and a control group (group C). In group K, 0.4 mg/kg ketamine was given as a continuous infusion over 20 min intraoperatively. Main Outcome Measure. Profile of Mood States (POMS) was recorded preoperatively and 2 hours postoperatively. RESULTS: There were no differences in preoperative POMS between the two groups. Mean postoperative POMS of group K was lower than that of group C indicating mood improvement. Ketamine group patients showed higher sedation score and increased, although self-limiting, psychedelic phenomena than the control group. CONCLUSION: Observed data here support an acute effect of ketamine on mood but any further claim will be speculative. Further future studies exploring postoperative mood scores after 24 hours post-infusion are needed. This trial is registered with PACTR201907779292947."
"4730","1","Intranasal ketamine in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: Current treatments for depression are only partially effective and exhibit delays in onset of therapeutic efficacy. Several studies have reported a rapid onset of antidepressant action for intravenous (IV) ketamine‐and NMDA receptor antagonist‐in patients with treatment resistant depression (TRD). Despite potential efficacy, the requirement for IV administration imposes potential limitations to therapeutic delivery. In contrast, ketamine delivery via an intranasal (IN) route may provide a more feasible treatment approach. Herein we report the first placebo‐controlled study of IN ketamine in TRD. Methods: Twenty subjects with TRD in a current major depressive episode were randomized to receive IN ketamine hydrochloride (50 mg) or 0.9% saline solution, in a crossover design with one of two treatment orders: either ketamineplacebo (KET‐PBO) or placebo‐ketamine (PBO‐KET); KET or PBO were administered 1‐2 weeks apart. 18 subjects received both treatments under randomized, double blind conditions. Before administration, subjects were admitted to a clinical research unit and study drug was administed by an anesthesiologist. Continuous vital signs monitoring was employed during and for 4 h following treatment. The primary efficacy outcome measure was change from baseline in the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at 24 h following KET, compared to PBO. Response and remission rates at 24 h represented secondary outcomes. Clinical response was defined as MADRS decrease ≥ 50% from baseline and remission was defined as a MADRS score of ≤9. To assess hemodynamic side effects, vital signs were monitored and clinically significant changes were defined as systolic or diastolic blood pressure (BP) 4180/100 or 420% increase above baseline level or tachycardia with heart rate 4110 beats/min. Management by medication interventions and treatment discontinuation was to be provided for significant hemodynamic changes. Other secondary outcomes included general adverse events, acute psychotomimetic effects, and dissociative effects, measured with the Systematic Assessment for Treatment Emergent Effects (SAFTEE), Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), and Clinician‐Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) respectively. Results: Subjects evidenced significant improvement in depressive symptoms within 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo (t=4.4, p<0.001). Following KET, 8 of 19 subjects responded (42%), compared to 2 of 19 (11%) following PBO. Among study completers (those who received both treatment conditions), 8 (44%) met the response criterion. Of these 8, 1 (6%) also responded to placebo, while no completer met response criteria only for placebo (p=0.0325 based on McNemar's test). Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with few side effects. Specifically, following ketamine, the mean increase in BPRS was 0.3, and in CADSS was 1.37. No patient exhibited clinically significant changes in hemodynamics. Conclusions: In this study, we demonstrated a rapid antidepressant effect of IN ketamine in patients with TRD. IN KET was well tolerated with almost no psychotmimetic or dissociative side effects and with no significant hemodynamic effects including blood pressure and heart rate changes. No interventions by anesthesiology were needed. Future studies are indicated to identify strategies for maintaining antidepressant response in patients who respond to intranasal ketamine."
"5752","0","The role of eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase in rapid antidepressant action of ketamine.^\nMajor depressive disorder is a devastating mental disorder. Current antidepressant medications can be effective for some patients with depression; however, these drugs exert mood-elevating effects only after prolonged administration, and a sizable fraction of the patient population fails to respond to treatment. There is an urgent need for faster-acting antidepressants with reliable treatment outcomes and sustained efficacy for individuals with depression, in particular those contemplating suicide. Recent clinical studies report that ketamine, an ionotropic glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor blocker, shows fast-acting antidepressant action, thus bringing fresh perspective into preclinical studies investigating novel antidepressant targets and treatments. Our recent studies show that the effects of ketamine are dependent on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and subsequent activation of the high-affinity BDNF receptor, TrkB. Our findings also suggest that the fast-acting antidepressant effects of ketamine require rapid protein translation, but not transcription, resulting in robust increases in dendritic BDNF protein levels that are important for the behavioral effect. These findings also uncover eukaryotic elongation factor 2 kinase (eEF2K), a Ca²⁺/calmodulin dependent serine/threonine kinase that phosphorylates eEF2 and regulates the elongation step of protein translation, as a major molecular substrate mediating the rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine. Our results show that ketamine-mediated suppression of resting NMDA receptor activity leads to inhibition of eEF2 kinase and subsequent dephosphorylation of eEF2 and augmentation of BDNF synthesis. This article outlines our recent studies on the synaptic mechanisms that underlie ketamine action, in particular the properties of eEF2K as a potential antidepressant target."
"5468","1","Positron emission tomographic studies of brain dopamine and serotonin transporters in abstinent (±)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (""ecstasy"") users: Relationship to cognitive performance.^\nBackground: (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is a recreational drug and brain serotonin (5-HT) neurotoxin. Under certain conditions, MDMA can also damage brain dopamine (DA) neurons, at least in rodents. Human MDMA users have been found to have reduced brain 5-HT transporter (SERT) density and cognitive deficits, although it is not known whether these are related. This study sought to determine whether MDMA users who take closely spaced sequential doses, which engender high plasma MDMA concentrations, develop DA transporter (DAT) deficits, in addition to SERT deficits, and whether there is a relationship between transporter binding and cognitive performance. Materials and methods: Sixteen abstinent MDMA users with a history of using sequential MDMA doses (two or more doses over a 3- to 12-h period) and 16 age-, gender-, and education-matched controls participated. Subjects underwent positron emission tomography with the DAT and SERT radioligands, [11C]WIN 35,428 and [11C]DASB, respectively. Subjects also underwent formal neuropsychiatric testing. Results: MDMA users had reductions in SERT binding in multiple brain regions but no reductions in striatal DAT binding. Memory performance in the aggregate subject population was correlated with SERT binding in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, orbitofrontal cortex, and parietal cortex, brain regions implicated in memory function. Prior exposure to MDMA significantly diminished the strength of this relationship. Conclusions: Use of sequential MDMA doses is associated with lasting decreases in brain SERT, but not DAT. Memory performance is associated with SERT binding in brain regions involved in memory function. Prior MDMA exposure appears to disrupt this relationship. These data are the first to directly relate memory performance to brain SERT density. © 2008 Springer-Verlag."

This toxic designer drug, also known as "" Death"" , is occasionally found in street drugs offered as "" ecstasy"" or "" amphetamine"" The present study aimed to evaluate the cause of death, and to compare the PMMA blood concentrations in fatal and non-fatal cases. Methods for identification and quantification of PMMA are presented. The median age of fatalities was 30 years (range 15-50) with 67% males; in non-fatal cases 27 years (20-47) with 86% males. In the 12 fatalities, the median PMMA blood concentration was 1.92. mg/L (range 0.17-3.30), which is in the reported lethal range of 0.6-3.1. mg/L in peripheral blood and 1.2-15.8. mg/L in heart blood. In the 22 non-fatal cases, the median PMMA concentration was 0.07. mg/L (range 0.01-0.65). Poly-drug use was frequent both in fatal and non-fatal cases. The PMA concentrations ranging from 0.00 to 0.26. mg/L in both groups likely represented a PMMA metabolite. Three fatalities were attributed to PMMA only, six to PMMA and other psychostimulant drugs, and three to PMMA and CNS depressant drugs, with median PMMA concentrations of 3.05. mg/L (range 1.58-3.30), 2.56 (1.52-3.23) and 0.52. mg/L (0.17-1.24), respectively. Eight victims were found dead, while death was witnessed in four cases, with symptoms of acute respiratory distress, hyperthermia, cardiac arrest, convulsions, sudden collapse and/or multiple organ failure. In summary, all fatalities attributed to PMMA had high PMMA blood concentrations compared to non-fatal cases. Our sample size was too small to evaluate a possible impact of poly-drug use.

"4138","0","ECT: a new look at an old friend.^\nPurpose of reviewElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) as a treatment option in psychiatry is advancing day by day. This review discusses new advancements in ECT with regards to anesthetic variables, stimulus, and response variables along with their impact on clinical outcomes.Recent findingsAnesthetic variables influence clinical efficacy and patient tolerance of ECT. Although etomidate or a ketamine-propofol combination may be the first choice for many clinicians, the search for ideal induction agent continues. Dexmedetomidine, remifentanil, or ketamine may aid in augmentation of ECT; however, they are not recommended routinely. A systematic procedure for hyperventilation of the patient has been shown to have clinical repercussions. Optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval (ASTI) has a significant impact on the success of the procedure. BIS monitoring alone cannot be relied upon for timing stimulus. High-dose brief pulse right unilateral ECT represents an acceptable first-line form of treatment, though there is currently no gold standard'. Other stimulus variations such as focal electrically administered seizure therapy, individualized low-amplitude seizure therapy, magnetic seizure therapy, left unilateral and left anterior right temporal electrode placements are explored to reduce memory effects. EEG ictal indices may be relied upon for seizure adequacy, and therefore may be used to both guide treatment and predict the outcome of the procedure.SummaryModern ECT is streamlined by augmentation with drugs, hyperventilation, optimizing anesthesia-ECT time interval, and various stimulus parameters guided by seizure adequacy markers."

"9406","0","LSD and psychotherapy.^\nA review of the historical trends in LSD research clearly indicates that LSD and similar drugs are too powerful and unique in their psychological effects to be mistaken for and studied as just another group of psychotropic compounds. The importance of the theoretical understanding and expectations of the researchers in determining the subjective effects and results of LSD treatment is undeniable. In addition, double-blind controlled studies have been demonstrated to be an inappropriate methodology for studying LSD, because it is not feasible to create an effective blind for LSD with either an active or inactive placebo. It must be realized that when attempting to scientifically study such ephemeral and easily influenced processes as those involving human consciousness, methods of study may influence the process and outcome of the research. In 1937 Werner Heisenberg demonstrated the uncertainty principle in relation to any attempt to measure with accuracy the minute processes of electrons in the atom. One must consider the possibility that current tools and methods for studying the effects of LSD are presently so crude as to demonstrate a similar uncertainty principle in LSD research: The methods of measuring actually influence the process under study to such a degree that the results that are garnered are primarily the effects of attempts at measurement. The continuing crisis in psychiatric and psychological treatment demands that the most powerful of the psychoactive drugs cannot simply be shelved and forgotten. The need is too strong to advance knowledge of the role and function of the human mind in health and disease. LSD and similar drugs hold a tremendous promise for humankind if only ways can be found to further understanding of how to use them responsibly and appropriately. Perhaps other societies that have integrated these substances into the very fabric of their social order may offer models. As Silberman (1970) has written: ""No approach is more impractical than one which takes the present arrangements and practices as given, asking only 'How can we do what we are doing more effectively?' or 'How can we bring the worst institutions up to the level of the best?' These questions need to be asked to be sure; but one must also realize that best may not be good enough and may, in any case, already be changing."""

The drug also has potential for abuse and it was of interest in the present study to determine if the drug had any abuse liability‐related subjective effects in this population. METHODS: Eighteen volunteers participated in a crossover, randomized, double‐blind study in which they received, all p.o., placebo; 50 mg propoxyphene napsylate; 100 mg propoxyphene napsylate; 200 mg propoxyphene napsylate; 40 mg morphine sulfate; and 2 mg lorazepam. Measures were assessed before and for 300 min after drug administration. RESULTS: Both morphine and lorazepam produced subjective effects. There were no statistically significant subjective effects obtained with any dose of propoxyphene in the group as a whole, but approximately 30‐50% of the subjects did appear to experience subjective effects from the drug. Drug liking was not consistently observed in this subset. Propoxyphene, unlike lorazepam, did not impair psychomotor or cognitive performance. Both propoxyphene and morphine produced miosis. CONCLUSIONS: There was a lack of statistically significant subjective effects of propoxyphene in the group as a whole, including a propoxyphene dose that was twice as high as the typical clinically‐prescribed dose of 100 mg. However, there were some subjects who did report effects, consistent with the notion that patients differ in their sensitivity to opioid effects."
"6015","1","Interaction Between Duloxetine and 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy).^\n3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") is widely used by young people for its euphoric effects. MDMA releases serotonin (5‐HT), norepinephrine (NE), and dopamine through an interaction with the corresponding presynaptic monoamine uptake transporter. 5‐HT transport inhibitors block MDMA‐induced 5‐HT release in vitro or in animals and also attenuate the subjective and cardiovascular response to MDMA in humans. NE transport inhibitors similarly prevent the MDMA‐induced release of NE in cell assays and attenuate behavioral effects of MDMA in animals. Effects of the NE transporter inhibitor reboxetine on the response to MDMA in humans are currently investigated. Here we suggest evaluating effects of pretreatment with the combined 5‐HT and NE transport blocker duloxetine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The study will use a randomized double‐blind cross‐over design with four experimental sessions. Duloxetine (120 mg) or placebo will be administered 16 h and 4 h before the administration of MDMA (125 mg) or placebo to 16 healthy volunteers. Subjective and cardiovascular responses and plasma samples for pharmacokinetics will be repeatedly assessed throughout the experiments."

"5026","0","AZD8529, a positive allosteric modulator at the MGGLUR2 receptor, does not improve symptoms in schizophrenia: a proof of principle study.^\nIntroduction: Aberrant cortical connectivity and hypofunction of NMDA receptor signaling may underlie schizophrenia symptoms. Direct activation of mGluR2/3 receptors has been shown to reduce NMDA hypofunction, reverse the psychotomimetic effects of NMDA antagonists, and in some studies, to produce an antipsychotic effect in acute schizophrenia. We have investigated the efficacy and tolerability of AZD8529 ((C25H28F3N5O6S), a selective positive allosteric modulator (PAM) at the mGluR2 receptor, in symptomatic patients with schizophrenia. Methods: This was a double blind, double‐dummy, placebo controlled, risperidone referenced, parallel groups, proof of concept clinical trial conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki at 3 US sites. Following 7 days washout, patients were randomized to receive either AZD8529 40 mg (n = 58), risperidone 4 mg (n = 31), or placebo (n = 55). Treatment lasted for 28 days, and clinical efficacy was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and the Clinical Global Impression Severity Scale and Improvement Scales (CGI‐S/CGI‐I) as primary outcome measures. Change from baseline to endpoint (LOCF) was analyzed by ANCOVA. Results: Out of 151 patients randomized, 8 were screen failed patients who were allocated a randomization number but never received study drug, 137 were considered evaluable and included in the efficacy analysis, and 144 were used for analysis of safety and tolerability. Overall, 104 patients (75.9%) completed the 4‐week treatment trial with highest completion rate seen for patients receiving placebo, and the lowest for patients receiving risperidone. The most common reason for withdrawal was lack of efficacy; the highest rate of withdrawal for this reason was in patients treated with placebo (15.1%) and the lowest rate was for patients receiving risperidone, where all patients completed the treatment trial. Baseline PANSS did not differ between groups (AZD8529‐92.9, Placebo ‐ 93.6, risperidone ‐ 91.0). After 28 days of treatment there was no significant difference between the AZD8529 and placebo groups in the PANSS total score change from baseline (D 4.3 and 2.9 respectively p = 0.491) Risperidone was significantly different from placebo (D ‐8.6 p <0.001) in PANSS total score change from baseline. Similarly CGI and secondary measures were not different between the AZD8529 and placebo groups. Of 15 patients who discontinued early due to lack of therapeutic response, 8 were on placebo and 7 were on AZD8529; none were randomized to risperidone Conclusion: In symptomatic schizophrenia patients, AZD8529 was no more efficacious than placebo treatment as measured by PANSS total scale, the CGI, and PANSS positive and negative symptoms subscales. This single dose study does not support a role for positive modulation of mGluR2 receptors as a mechanism for monotherapy to treat acute schizophrenia. These results are also inconsistent with experimental evidence to date supporting a role for mGluR2 receptor activation in antipsychotic therapy. It remains to be determined whether different treatment regimens or adjunct treatment would provide benefit."
"4084","1","Active mechanisms of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy: A systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: Few studies have evaluated the efficacy of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KAP) in the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and substance use disorders (SUD). METHODS: A systematic review of clinical trials reporting on the efficacy of KAP and discussing mechanisms of action, identified on PubMed and PsycInfo. RESULTS: Five randomized-controlled trials reported on the efficacy of KAP treatment and discussed active mechanisms. Four of the studies treated adults with SUD and a single study treated adults with TRD. Overall, KAP had a significant positive effect on primary outcome measures compared to controls, however, the data is mixed. The study examining KAP for TRD found no benefit. LIMITATIONS: Lack of large, replicated clinical trials. No studies actively examining mechanisms of action. CONCLUSION: Evidence suggests that temporary neural changes caused by ketamine such as n-methyl-d-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inhibition and increase of synaptic neuroplasticity affect treatment outcomes of KAP. Based on reports of preliminary findings, we speculate that adjunct psychotherapy, changes in perspective, and spirituality may also play a role."

MDMA/ecstasy and classic psychedelics (psilocybin, LSD, peyote, mescaline) represent two potential treatments for impairments in social functioning, as evidence suggests these compounds may be supportive for alleviating social difficulties. Using a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (2015-2019) (N = 214,505), we used survey-weighted multivariable ordinal and logistic regression to examine the associations between lifetime use of the aforementioned compounds and impairments in social functioning in the past year. Lifetime MDMA/ecstasy use was associated with lowered odds of three of our four social impairment outcomes: difficulty dealing with strangers (aOR 0.92), difficulty participating in social activities (aOR 0.90), and being prevented from participating in social activities (aOR 0.84). Lifetime mescaline use was also associated with lowered odds of difficulty dealing with strangers (aOR 0.85). All other substances either shared no relationship with impairments in social functioning or conferred increased odds of our outcomes. Future experimental studies can assess whether these relationships are causal."

Research suggests the potential safety and efficacy of psilocybin in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress and substance use disorders, setting the occasion for this review. A more extensive assessment of abuse potential according to an 8-factor analysis would eventually be required to guide appropriate schedule placement. Psilocybin, like other 5-HT2A agonist classic psychedelics, has limited reinforcing effects, supporting marginal, transient non-human self-administration. Nonetheless, mushrooms with variable psilocybin content are used illicitly, with a few lifetime use occasions being normative among users. Potential harms include dangerous behavior in unprepared, unsupervised users, and exacerbation of mental illness in those with or predisposed to psychotic disorders. However, scope of use and associated harms are low compared to prototypical abused drugs, and the medical model addresses these concerns with dose control, patient screening, preparation and follow-up, and session supervision in a medical facility. Conclusions: (1) psilocybin has an abuse potential appropriate for CSA scheduling if approved as medicine; (2) psilocybin can provide therapeutic benefits that may support the development of an approvable New Drug Application (NDA) but further studies are required which this review describes; (3) adverse effects of medical psilocybin are manageable when administered according to risk management approaches; and (4) although further study is required, this review suggests that placement in Schedule IV may be appropriate if a psilocybin-containing medicine is approved.

"6707","1","Is ecstasy MDMA? A review of the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA, their dosage levels, and the changing perceptions of purity.^\nAIMS: Not every tablet sold as ""ecstasy"" contains MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). The historical origins and evolution of this mismatch will be reviewed, in order to estimate the proportions of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA at different periods over the past 30 years. METHODS: Surveys into the pharmacological constituents of ecstasy tablets, dosage levels, and empirical reports of their perceived purity, provide the main data for this review. RESULTS: During the 1980s and early 1990s there were few problems with the purity of ecstasy tablets, and the biochemical evidence shows that they nearly always contained MDMA. During the mid-1990s, the majority of ecstasy tablets continued to contain MDMA, while many others comprised MDA (3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine), MDEA (3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine), or amphetamine drug mixtures. However, a small proportion (4-20% according to survey, time and place), comprised non-amphetamine drugs such as caffeine, ephedrine, ketamine, paracetamol, or placebo. During the late 1990s, the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA increased to around 80-90%. The latest reports suggest that non-MDMA tablets are now very infrequent, with purity levels between 90% and 100%. Dosage levels of tablets are also highly variable, with low dose tablet often encountered during the mid-1990s, and high dose tablets now seen more frequently. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings will be debated. CONCLUSIONS: The ecstasy purity problem was predominantly a phenomenon of the mid to late 1990s, when many tablets contained substances other than MDMA. Before and since then, the proportion of ecstasy tablets containing MDMA has been very high."

Studies on the acute and long-term neurotoxicity of cathinones are starting to be conducted. We investigated the neurochemical/enzymatic changes indicative of neurotoxicity after methylone administration (4 x 20 mg/kg, subcutaneously, per day with 3 h intervals) to adolescent rats, to model human recreational use. In addition, we studied the effect of methylone on spatial learning ad memory using the Morris water maze paradigm. Our experiments were carried out at a high ambient temperature to simulate the hot conditions found in dance clubs where the drug is consumed. We observed a hyperthermic response to methylone that reached a peak 30 min after each dose. We determined a serotonergic impairment in methylone-treated rats, especially in the frontal cortex, where it was accompanied by astrogliosis. Some serotonergic alterations were also present in the hippocampus and striatum. No significant neurotoxic effect on the dopaminergic system was identified. Methylone-treated animals only displayed impairments in the probe trial of the Morris water maze, which concerns reference memory, while the spatial learning process seemed to be preserved."
"5698","1","The safety and efficacy of {+/-}3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study.^\nCase reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments."

"6419","1","Psychedelic therapy for smoking cessation: Qualitative analysis of participant accounts.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent pilot trials suggest feasibility and potential efficacy of psychedelic-facilitated addiction treatment interventions. Fifteen participants completed a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation pilot study between 2009 and 2015. AIMS: The aims of this study were as follows: (1) to identify perceived mechanisms of change leading to smoking cessation in the pilot study; (2) to identify key themes in participant experiences and long-term outcomes to better understand the therapeutic process. METHODS: Participants were invited to a retrospective follow-up interview an average of 30 months after initial psilocybin sessions. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with 12 of the 15 participants. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. RESULTS: Participants reported gaining vivid insights into self-identity and reasons for smoking from their psilocybin sessions. Experiences of interconnectedness, awe, and curiosity persisted beyond the duration of acute drug effects. Participants emphasised that the content of psilocybin experiences overshadowed any short-term withdrawal symptoms. Preparatory counselling, strong rapport with the study team, and a sense of momentum once engaged in the study treatment were perceived as vital additional factors in achieving abstinence. In addition, participants reported a range of persisting positive changes beyond smoking cessation, including increased aesthetic appreciation, altruism, and pro-social behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The findings highlight the value of qualitative research in the psychopharmacological investigation of psychedelics. They describe perceived connections between drug- and non-drug factors, and provide suggestions for future research trial design and clinical applications."
"7225","1","Effects of Ketamine on Brain Activity During Emotional Processing: Differential Findings in Depressed Versus Healthy Control Participants.^\nBACKGROUND: In the search for novel treatments for depression, ketamine has emerged as a unique agent with rapid antidepressant effects. Experimental tasks involving emotional processing can be used during functional magnetic resonance imaging scanning to investigate ketamine's effects on brain function in major depressive disorder (MDD). This study examined ketamine's effects on functional magnetic resonance imaging activity during an emotional processing task. METHODS: A total of 33 individuals with treatment-resistant MDD and 24 healthy control participants (HCs) took part in this double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study. Participants received ketamine and placebo infusions 2 weeks apart, and functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were conducted at baseline and 2 days after each infusion. Blood oxygen level-dependent signal was measured during an emotional processing task, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to analyze differences in activation among group, drug, and task-specific factors. RESULTS: A group-by-drug interaction was observed in several brain regions, including a right frontal cluster extending into the anterior cingulate cortex and insula. Participants with MDD had greater activity than HCs after placebo infusion but showed lower activity after ketamine infusion, which was similar to the activity in HCs after placebo. A group-by-drug-by-task condition interaction was also found, which showed further differences that varied between implicit and explicit emotional conditions. CONCLUSIONS: The main results indicate that ketamine had differential effects on brain activity in participants with MDD versus HCs. The pattern of activation in participants with MDD after ketamine infusion resembled the activation in HCs after placebo infusion, suggesting a normalization of function during emotional processing.

Here we assessed basal plasma oxytocin, arginine vasopressin, and cortisol levels in a naturalistic sample of methamphetamine polydrug users (n = 12) compared with controls matched for age, gender, education, occupation status, and marital status (n = 17). All of the methamphetamine users tested positive for blood methamphetamine and/or its main metabolite, amphetamine. Other drugs of abuse were detected in a small number of methamphetamine users (MDMA [3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine; n = 2], THC [delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol; n = 2]). Almost half of the methamphetamine users reported using methamphetamine intravenously, and others smoked or ingested the drug. Methamphetamine users had significantly lower basal plasma cortisol (p = .025), but similar basal plasma oxytocin and arginine vasopressin levels compared with controls. Basal plasma oxytocin was positively correlated (p = .011), with basal plasma arginine vasopressin in controls, but not in methamphetamine users. Methamphetamine users reported higher rates of psychiatric symptoms including substance use disorders, impulsivity, and positive, negative, manic, and disorientation symptoms compared with controls. Psychiatric symptoms were not related to neuroendocrine functioning in either group. These results provide preliminary evidence for lowered basal cortisol levels in methamphetamine polydrug users and encourage further research in to the effects of methamphetamine on neuroendocrine functioning in humans using more highly controlled experimental research designs. © 2012 American Psychological Association."
"1942","1","Moderators of ayahuasca's biological antidepressant action.^\nINTRODUCTION: The understanding of biological responses to psychedelics with antidepressant potential is imperative. Here we report how a set of acute parameters, namely emotional (depressive symptoms), cognitive (psychedelic experience), and physiological (salivary cortisol), recorded during an ayahuasca dosing session, modulated serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), serum cortisol (SC), serum interleukin 6 (IL-6), plasma C-reactive protein (CRP), and salivary cortisol awakening response (CAR). METHODS: Results were analyzed 2 days after the psychedelic intervention (ayahuasca) versus placebo in both patients with treatment-resistant depression and healthy volunteers. These measures were assessed as part of a randomized double-blinded, placebo-controlled trial (n = 72). RESULTS: Results revealed that larger reductions of depressive symptoms during the dosing session significantly moderated higher levels of SC in patients. Whereas lesser changes in salivary cortisol levels during the ayahuasca intervention were related to higher BDNF levels in patients with a larger clinical response in the reduction in depressive symptoms. No moderator was found for patient's CAR, IL-6, and CRP responses to ayahuasca and for all biomarker responses to ayahuasca in healthy controls and in the placebo group. DISCUSSION: In summary, some specific emotional and physiological parameters during experimental ayahuasca session were revealed as critical moderators of the improvement of major depression biomarkers, mainly BDNF and SC two days after ayahuasca intake. These findings contribute to paving the way for future studies investigating the biological antidepressant response to psychedelic therapy."
"1263","1","5-HT2A agonist drugs as new treatments in psychiatry.^\nPsilocybin is a non‐selective serotonin receptor agonist that occurs naturally in certain mushroom species. Recent studies have assessed the therapeutic potential of psilocybin for a variety of conditions, including: end of life anxiety [1], obsessive compulsive disorder [2] and smoking [3] and alcohol dependence [4], with promising preliminary results. The present study aimed to investigate psilocybin's safety and efficacy in patients with unipolar treatment‐resistant depression. In this open‐label feasibility trial, 12 patients (6 females) with moderate to severe, unipolar, treatment‐resistant major depression received two oral doses of psilocybin (10 mg and 25 mg, 7 days apart) in a supportive setting. Psychological support was provided before, during and after each session. Depressive symptoms were assessed with standard assessments from 1 week to 3 months posttreatment, with the QIDS‐16 serving as the primary outcome. Treatment was well‐tolerated by all of the patients. No unexpected and only a small number of minor adverse events were observed. Relative to baseline, depressive symptoms were markedly reduced 1 week (mean QIDS difference = ‐11.8, 95% CI, ‐5 to ‐17, Cohen's d = 3.4) and 3 months post‐treatment (mean QIDS difference = ‐9.2, 95% CI, +3 to ‐17, Cohen's d = 2.3). Marked and sustained improvements in anxiety and anhedonia were also observed. This study provides preliminary support for the safety and efficacy of a novel intervention for treatment‐resistant depression. It should motivate further trials, with more rigorous designs, to better examine the therapeutic potential of this approach."
"3176","1","Psilocybin produces substantial and sustained decreases in depression and anxiety in patients with life-threatening cancer: A randomized double-blind trial.^\nCancer patients often develop chronic, clinically significant symptoms of depression and anxiety. Previous studies suggest that psilocybin may decrease depression and anxiety in cancer patients. The effects of psilocybin were studied in 51 cancer patients with life-threatening diagnoses and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. This randomized, double-blind, cross-over trial investigated the effects of a very low (placebo-like) dose (1 or 3 mg/70 kg) vs. a high dose (22 or 30 mg/70 kg) of psilocybin administered in counterbalanced sequence with 5 weeks between sessions and a 6-month follow-up. Instructions to participants and staff minimized expectancy effects. Participants, staff, and community observers rated participant moods, attitudes, and behaviors throughout the study. High-dose psilocybin produced large decreases in clinician- and self-rated measures of depressed mood and anxiety, along with increases in quality of life, life meaning, and optimism, and decreases in death anxiety. At 6-month follow-up, these changes were sustained, with about 80% of participants continuing to show clinically significant decreases in depressed mood and anxiety. Participants attributed improvements in attitudes about life/self, mood, relationships, and spirituality to the high-dose experience, with >80% endorsing moderately or greater increased well-being/life satisfaction. Community observer ratings showed corresponding changes. Mystical-type psilocybin experience on session day mediated the effect of psilocybin dose on therapeutic outcomes.

"6040","1","Randomized, Double-blind, Controlled of MDMA-assisted Psychotherapy in 12 Subjects With PTSD.^\nPost traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating disorder that can develop after people experience a traumatic event, such as a rape, car accident or other life threatening event. PTSD is a worldwide health problem. PTSD is treated with psychotherapy or drugs, but these treatments do not help everyone. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)‐assisted psychotherapy might be a potential treatment for PTSD. MDMA is the active ingredient in ecstasy. Before it was made illegal, some psychotherapists combined MDMA with psychotherapy to help treat people with psychological problems, including PTSD. This is a Phase 2 randomized, dose comparison, double‐blind study to assess safety and efficacy of manualized MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy in treating chronic, treatment‐resistant PTSD. Seven subjects will be randomized to receive full dose MDMA (full dose condition) and five subjects will receive a comparator (comparator condition), with an optional supplemental half‐dose available 1.5 to 2.5 hours after the initial dose. Global Clinician‐Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS) score one month after two sessions of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy is the primary outcome measure. MDMA or comparator will be administered in two blinded experimental sessions lasting up to eight hours and scheduled three to five weeks apart. The will last up to one and a half years, including approximately three to five months of psychotherapy, and a long‐term follow up visit scheduled a year after the final experimental session. Study subjects will have a medical and psychiatric examination to assess eligibility for enrollment. Once in the study, they will see the same male and female psychotherapist for the entire study. The subject will learn more about MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy and the investigators will learn more about the subject during three preparatory sessions occurring before the first experimental session. During experimental sessions, subjects will receive an initial dose of either full dose MDMA or placebo along with psychotherapy, and one and a half to two and a half hours later, the subject may have a supplemental half the size of the initial dose. Vital signs and psychological distress will be measured throughout the experimental session. There will be three integrative psychotherapy sessions after each experimental session, including one occurring the day after an experimental session. Subjects will express, understand and connect any of their thoughts or feelings about PTSD symptoms and their causes, and they will discuss their experience during experimental sessions with the therapists. Subjects will learn the dose of MDMA they received one month after the second MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy session. Subjects who received full dose will complete Stage 1, with a third open‐label session, and subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will go on to Stage 2, an open label period of the study that is nearly identical to stage 1, but with one instead of three preparatory sessions and one of two active doses of MDMA used in all three experimental sessions. This study will compare the effects of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy with comparator versus full dose MDMA, and it will also assess the duration of any changes in symptoms a year after MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy. Symptoms of PTSD, depression, dissociation, general psychological well‐being, sleep quality and potential positive effects of experiencing traumatic events will be measured in all subjects at baseline, one month after the second experimental session and 12 months after their final experimental session, and any subjects reporting pain or tinnitus at the start of the study will record these symptoms throughout the study.Subjects who received the full dose and go on to the third experimental session will complete questionnaires and measures of PTSD and other symptoms two months after the third experimental session. Subjects who received comparator dose MDMA will be tested one month after their second Stage 2 experimental session and two months after the third experimental session. Measures of cognitive function will be given to subjects in Stage two months after their third experimental session, and to Stage 2 subjects two months after their third Stage 2 session. People will also complete measures of their experience of the experimental session soon after each experimental session. At least 12 months after their final Stage 1 or Stage 2 session, measures of PTSD symptoms, other symptoms, sleep quality, general well‐being and and post traumatic growth will be assessed again, and subjects will complete a questionnaire on the benefits and harms of study participation and other life events and views related to study participation."
"8305","1","The acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and methamphetamine on driving: a simulator study.^\nOBJECTIVES: Illicit drugs such as MDMA and methamphetamine are commonly abused drugs that have also been observed to be prevalent in drivers injured in road accidents. Their exact effect on driving and driving behavior has yet to be thoroughly investigated. METHODS: Sixty-one abstinent recreational users of illicit drugs comprised the participant sample, with 33 females and 28 males, mean age 25.45 years. The three testing sessions involved oral consumption of 100 mg MDMA, 0.42 mg/kg methamphetamine, or a matching placebo. The drug administration was counter-balanced, double-blind, and medically supervised. At each session driving performance was assessed 3 h and 24 h post drug administration on a computerized driving simulator. RESULTS: At peak concentration overall impairment scores for driving (F(2,118)=9.042, p<0.001) and signaling (F(2,118)=4.060, p=0.020) were significantly different for the daytime simulations. Performance in the MDMA condition was worse than both the methamphetamine (p=0.023) and placebo (p<0.001) conditions and the methamphetamine condition was also observed to be worse in comparison to the placebo (p=0.055). For signaling adherence, poorer signaling adherence occurred in both the methamphetamine (p=0.006) and MDMA (p=0.017) conditions in comparison to placebo in the daytime simulations. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of this study have for the first time illustrated how both MDMA and methamphetamine effect driving performance, and provide support for legislation regarding testing for the presence of illicit drugs in impaired or injured drivers as deterrents for driving under the influence of illicit drugs."
"7946","1","A Pilot Study of Ketamine Infusion after Suicide Attempt: New Frontiers in Treating Acute Suicidality in a Real-World Medical Setting.^\nKetamine, in research settings, rapidly reduces suicidal thoughts 2-24 h after a single infusion in patients with high suicidal ideation. In this study, the authors investigate ketamine's effects on suicidality in a real-world sample of recent suicide attempters on a tertiary-care Consultation-Liaison (CL) psychiatry service. Using an open-label design, 16 transdiagnostic CL patients were recruited, 18-65 years old, to receive a single dose of intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) in the acute medical setting. All were psychiatrically hospitalized post-infusion. Baseline suicidality and depression measures were compared to ratings taken at 24 h, 5 days, 12 days, and 1, 3 and 6 months post-infusion using paired t-tests. Across all measures, rapid, statistically significant decreases (p's < 0.001) were observed with large to very large effect sizes (Cohen's d's: 1.7-8.8) at acute timepoints (24 h; 5 days). These gains were uniformly maintained to 6 months post-infusion. Open-label ketamine appeared to rapidly and robustly reduced suicidal symptoms in an ultra-high-risk, heterogeneous, real-world sample. Ketamine infusion may therefore be a safe, feasible, viable method to rapidly reduce suicidality among medically hospitalized patients after a suicide attempt, with potentially enduring benefits. The current pilot findings suggest ketamine could be readily integrated into the settings where high-risk CL patients already receive healthcare, with the potential to become an important and novel tool in the treatment of suicidality."
"6870","1","Intranasal ketamine for acute Cluster headache attacks-Results from a proof-of-concept open label trial.^\nBackground and objective: Acute treatment options for Cluster headache patients who have an insufficient response to oxygen and triptans are limited. Intranasal ketamine has anecdotally been successful in treating a Cluster headache attack but never systematically tested. Methods: We conducted an open‐label pilot study in which 20 chronic Cluster headache patients according to International Classification of Headache Disorders 3rd were treated during one cluster headache attack with intranasal ketamine. Under in‐hospital observation patients received 15 mg ketamine by intranasal spray every six minutes a maximum of five times. The primary endpoint was a 50% reduction of pain intensity within 15 minutes after initiating treatment. Results: The primary endpoint was not met. However, 30 minutes after first application the pain intensity was reduced by 59% from 7.25 ± 1.24 to 2.94 ± 3.40 on a 1 1 points numeric rating scale (mean, SD, p = 0.0002) and 11 out of 16 (69%) scored four or below on the numeric rating scale. Exactly, half the patients preferred ketamine to oxygen and/or sumatriptan injection and complete relief was self‐reported by 8 out of 20 patients (40%). No serious advense events were identified during the trial. Conclusion: Intranasal ketamine may be an effective acute treatment of cluster headache within 30 minutes but should be tested in a larger controlled design. Patients and physicians should be conscious of the abuse potential of ketamine."
"5378","1","Me, myself, bye: regional alterations in glutamate and the experience of ego dissolution with psilocybin.^\nThere is growing interest in the therapeutic utility of psychedelic substances, like psilocybin, for disorders characterized by distortions of the self-experience, like depression. Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior; however this has never been tested in humans. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we utilized an ultra-high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced region-dependent alterations in glutamate, which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one's self (ego dissolution). Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic, as well as the baseline, state. Importantly, they may also provide a neurochemical basis for therapeutic effects as witnessed in ongoing clinical trials."
"8708","0","Polydrug use, cannabis, and psychosis-like symptoms.^\nObjective: To examine psychosis-like symptoms in users of legal and illicit drugs. Methods: Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) scores were compared in groups of people with different exposure to cannabis, with the use of other drugs serving as a covariate. Supplemental analyses compared users of legal and illicit drugs with cannabis use as a covariate. Results: Weekly (n = 111) and monthly (n = 136) cannabis users had higher scores on the SPQ than former (n = 143) and non-users (n = 81). The use of other drugs accounted for the links between cannabis and schizotypy. Lifetime use of psychomotor stimulant drugs plus ecstasy accounted for associations between cannabis and scores on the SPQ and its different subscales. Dividing groups by type of drug use revealed that those who used only cannabis and legal drugs (CLDs) (n = 126) were no different from those who used only legal drugs (LDs) (n = 74) but both groups scored significantly lower on the SPQ than polydrug users (n = 247). When controlling for marijuana use in the last month, the significant difference across drug use groups remained. Conclusions: The results suggest that research on marijuana and schizotypy requires careful assessment of the use of other drugs, especially psychomotor stimulants and ecstasy.

"9274","0","Development of a rapid and sensitive method for the quantitation of amphetamines in human plasma and oral fluid by LC-MS-MS.^\nTarget analysis of amphetamines in biological samples is of great importance for clinical and forensic toxicologists alike. At present, most laboratories analyze such samples by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. However, this procedure is labor-intensive and time-consuming, particularly as a preliminary extraction and derivatization are usually unavoidable. Here we describe the development of an alternative method. Amphetamines were isolated from human plasma and oral fluid using a simple methanol precipitation step and subsequently analyzed using reversed-phase liquid chromatographytandem mass spectrometry. Quantitation of the drugs was performed using multiple reaction monitoring. The developed method, which requires only 50 μL of biological sample, has a total analysis time of less than 20 min (including sample preparation) and enables the simultaneous quantitation of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine, amphetamine, methamphetamine, and ephedrine in a single chromatographic run. Limits of detection of 2 μg/L or better were obtained. The method has been validated and subsequently applied to the analysis of plasma and oral fluid samples collected from current drug users."
"9297","1","An item response theory analysis of DSM-IV criteria for hallucinogen abuse and dependence in adolescents.^\nAim: This study applied both item response theory (IRT) and multiple indicators-multiple causes (MIMIC) methods to evaluate item-level psychometric properties of diagnostic questions for hallucinogen use disorders (HUDs), differential item functioning (DIF), and predictors of latent HUD. Methods: Data were drawn from 2004-2006 National Surveys on Drug Use and Health. Analyses were based on 1548 past-year hallucinogen users aged 12-17 years. Substance use and symptoms were assessed by audio computer-assisted self-interviewing methods. Results: Abuse and dependence criteria empirically were arrayed along a single continuum of severity. All abuse criteria indicated middle-to-high severity on the IRT-defined HUD continuum, while dependence criteria captured a wider range from the lowest (tolerance and time spent) to the highest (taking larger amounts and inability to cut down) severity levels. There was indication of DIF by hallucinogen users' age, gender, race/ethnicity, and ecstasy use status. Adjusting for DIF, ecstasy users (vs. non-ecstasy hallucinogen users), females (vs. males), and whites (vs. Hispanics) exhibited increased odds of HUD. Conclusions: Symptoms of hallucinogen abuse and dependence empirically do not reflect two discrete conditions in adolescents. Trends and problems related to hallucinogen use among girls and whites should be examined further to inform the designs of effective gender-appropriate and culturally sensitive prevention programs. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd."
"6351","0","Dark Classics in Chemical Neuroscience: Lysergic Acid Diethylamide (LSD).^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is one of the most potent psychoactive agents known, producing dramatic alterations of consciousness after submilligram (≥20 μg) oral doses. Following the accidental discovery of its potent psychoactive effects in 1943, it was supplied by Sandoz Laboratories as an experimental drug that might be useful as an adjunct for psychotherapy, or to give psychiatrists insight into the mental processes in their patients. The finding of serotonin in the mammalian brain in 1953, and its structural resemblance to LSD, quickly led to ideas that serotonin in the brain might be involved in mental disorders, initiating rapid research interest in the neurochemistry of serotonin. LSD proved to be physiologically very safe and nonaddictive, with a very low incidence of adverse events when used in controlled experiments. Widely hailed by psychiatry as a breakthrough in the 1950s and early 1960s, clinical research with LSD ended by about 1970, when it was formally placed into Schedule 1 of the Controlled Substances Act of 1970 following its growing popularity as a recreational drug. Within the past 5 years, clinical research with LSD has begun in Europe, but there has been none in the United States. LSD is proving to be a powerful tool to help understand brain dynamics when combined with modern brain imaging methods. It remains to be seen whether therapeutic value for LSD can be confirmed in controlled clinical trials, but promising results have been obtained in small pilot trials of depression, anxiety, and addictions using psilocybin, a related psychedelic molecule."
"5032","1","The efficacy and safety of esketamine in the treatment of major depressive disorder with suicidal ideation: study protocol for a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a high risk factor for suicide, with up to 20% of MDD patients attempting suicide during their lifetime. Current treatments for MDD are slow onset of action, low efficiency, and the inability to control suicidal behaviors quickly and effectively. Intravenous ketamine has been shown to have a rapid but transient antidepressant effect, but there is still lack evidence on the efficacy and safety of intravenous esketamine in reducing suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. We designed a study to investigate the effect of short-term repeated intravenous infusion of esketamine three times in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. METHODS: This study features a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial (RCT) comparing short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine with placebo as a supplement to conventional antidepressants with an intervention period of 6 days and one infusion every other day, followed by 4 weeks of follow-up. These methods support the examination of the efficacy, safety, tolerability, and mechanism of action of short-term repeated intravenous infusions of esketamine in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: This is the first RCT to explore the efficacy and safety of short-term repeated infusion of esketamine on suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD patients with suicidal ideation. If proven effective and tolerated, it will provide evidence for rapid and effective treatment of suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms in MDD individuals with suicidal ideation.

Method: Cumulated lifetime data from a prospective, longitudinal community study of 2588 adolescents and young adults in Munich, Germany, were used. Substance use at baseline, 4-year and 10-year follow-up and psychotic symptoms at 4-year and 10-year follow-up were assessed using the Munich-Composite International Diagnostic Interview. Data from all assessment waves were aggregated, and multinomial logistic regression analyses were performed. Additional analyses adjusted for sociodemographics, common mental disorders, other substance use, and childhood adversity (adjusted odds ratios, AOR). Results: After adjusting for potential confounders, lifetime experience of two or more psychotic symptoms was associated with lifetime use of cocaine (AOR 1.94; 95% CI 1.10-3.45) and psychedelics (AOR 2.37; 95% CI 1.20-4.66). Additionally, when mood or anxiety disorders were excluded, lifetime experience of two or more psychotic symptoms was associated with use of psychedelics (AOR 3.56; 95% CI 1.20-10.61). Conclusion: Associations between psychotic symptoms and use of cocaine, and/or psychedelics in adolescents and young adults call for further studies to elucidate risk factors and developmental pathways. © 2010 John Wiley & Sons A/S."
"2926","1","Experimentally induced aggressive behavior in subjects with 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (""Ecstasy"") use history: Psychobiological correlates.^\nPurpose: Objective measures of experimentally induced aggressiveness were evaluated in 12 male 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") users, in comparison with 20 healthy male subjects. Methods: All the subjects were preliminarily submitted to DSM-IV interviews and Buss-Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI). During a laboratory task, the Point Subtraction Aggression Paradigm (PSAP), subjects earned monetary reinforcers with repeated button presses, and were provoked by the subtraction of money that was attributed to a fictitious other participant. Subjects could respond by ostensibly subtracting money from the fictitious subject (the aggressive response). Escape responses were also possible protecting the counter from monetary subtractions. Results: Money-earning responses were not different in Ecstasy users and controls; aggressive responses were significantly higher in Ecstasy users in comparison with control subjects (F=20.74, P<.001). Baseline adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) and cortisol (CORT) levels were higher in Ecstasy users than in controls. No difference was found in norepinephrine (NE) and epinephrine (EPI) basal levels of the two groups. During the experimentally induced aggressiveness, plasma ACTH concentrations increased significantly less and NE and EPI levels, together with heart rate (HR), increased significantly more in Ecstasy users than in healthy subjects. Despite ACTH-blunted responses, CORT did not increase differently from controls in Ecstasy users. PSAP aggressive responses positively correlated with catecholamines and CORT changes, BDHI Direct Aggression and Irritability scores, both in Ecstasy users and controls. A significant correlation was found between Ecstasy exposure extent and aggressive responses (r=.78, P<.001). Implications: Our findings suggest that Ecstasy users have higher outward-directed aggressiveness than healthy subjects. Aggressiveness in MDMA subjects seems to be associated more with MDMA pharmacological effects than with personality traits: Nevertheless, a premorbid psychobiological proneness to aggressive behavior cannot be excluded. Increased catecholamines reactivity, basal hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis hyperactivity, and blunted ACTH responses could be due to MDMA action on monoaminergic pathways and adrenal function. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

"7586","0","Environmental enrichment ameliorates phencyclidine-induced cognitive deficits.^\nRecent work has suggested that environmental enrichment during development can enhance aspects of learning and memory, however its effects on executive function and cognitive flexibility have not been well studied. The goal of this research was to evaluate whether environmental enrichment (EE) that included wheel running would improve cognitive performance in young male Long Evans rats that received subchronic administration of either phencyclidine (PCP) or saline. We used a sensitive extradimensional/intradimensional (ED/ID) test of cognitive flexibility similar to that used in humans and nonhuman primates for assessing executive function. PCP-treated rats demonstrated a selective impairment on ED shift (EDS) performance without significant impairment on other discrimination problems when compared to saline treated control animals. A separate group of animals that received PCP + EE demonstrated significantly improved performance on EDS and reversal learning problems, whereas the saline + EE group demonstrated a non-selective improvement in overall performance when compared to non-enriched saline controls. The saline + EE group demonstrated greater activity levels as measured by wheel running when compared to the PCP + EE group, but no significant associations were found between wheel running and cognitive performance. Together, these data suggest that EE that features wheel running may have promoted a general cognitive enhancement while also selectively acting upon neurobiological mechanisms that subserve executive function and cognitive flexibility in impaired animals. Development of novel treatment methodologies that target mechanisms underlying the ameliorative effects of EE in this model of cognitive impairment may be a useful tool in the development of new therapeutic strategies for disorders that feature cognitive dysfunction as a key symptom."
"5323","1","Prevalence and risk factors associated with recreational stimulant use among Berlin college students.^\nBackground: College students have been recognized as a risk group for substance use. Nevertheless, coherent risk factors for stimulant use remain to be elucidated. The objective of this paper is to identify risk factors associated with the recreational use of MDMA, cocaine, amphetamine and methamphetamine. Methods: An online questionnaire was distributed among colleges in Berlin. A sample of 12,914 college students participated, of which 9,382 met the inclusion criteria. Results: Past-month prevalence was 7.0% for MDMA, 6.7% for amphetamine, 5.8% for cocaine and 0.1% for methamphetamine. Associated factors included male gender, “other” gender, homosexual and bisexual orientation, open relationship status or being single, engaging in sexual risk-taking behavior, having a psychiatric diagnosis, tobacco use, drinking alcohol and an increased number of (illicit) substances consumed in the past month and in life. Conclusions: Berlin college students showed a substantially higher prevalence of stimulant use compared to both the general population and college students in other cities. Certain parameters, e.g., polydrug use, were particularly high in this group. The results can be used in further development of prevention efforts. However, conclusions about causality are limited by the cross-sectional nature of this study, highlighting the necessity for longitudinal studies in this field."
"6325","1","Ketamine and Other NMDA Antagonists: Early Clinical Trials and Possible Mechanisms in Depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine and other N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists in the treatment of major depression. METHOD: Searches of MEDLINE, PsycINFO, and other databases were conducted for placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomized clinical trials of NMDA antagonists in the treatment of depression. Primary outcomes were rates of treatment response and transient remission of symptoms. Secondary outcomes included change in depression symptom severity and the frequency and severity of dissociative and psychotomimetic effects. Results for each NMDA antagonist were combined in meta-analyses, reporting odds ratios for dichotomous outcomes and standardized mean differences for continuous outcomes. RESULTS: Ketamine (seven trials encompassing 147 ketamine-treated participants) produced a rapid, yet transient, antidepressant effect, with odds ratios for response and transient remission of symptoms at 24 hours equaling 9.87 (4.37-22.29) and 14.47 (2.67-78.49), respectively, accompanied by brief psychotomimetic and dissociative effects. Ketamine augmentation of ECT (five trials encompassing 89 ketamine-treated participants) significantly reduced depressive symptoms following an initial treatment (Hedges' g=0.933) but not at the conclusion of the ECT course. Other NMDA antagonists failed to consistently demonstrate efficacy; however, two partial agonists at the NMDA coagonist site, d-cycloserine and rapastinel, significantly reduced depressive symptoms without psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. CONCLUSIONS: The antidepressant efficacy of ketamine, and perhaps D-cycloserine and rapastinel, holds promise for future glutamate-modulating strategies; however, the ineffectiveness of other NMDA antagonists suggests that any forthcoming advances will depend on improving our understanding of ketamine's mechanism of action. The fleeting nature of ketamine's therapeutic benefit, coupled with its potential for abuse and neurotoxicity, suggest that its use in the clinical setting warrants caution."
"4584","1","Dose-related ethanol-like effects of the NMDA antagonist, ketamine, in recently detoxified alcoholics.^\nBACKGROUND: This study evaluated the dose-related ethanol-like subjective effects of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine hydrochloride in recently detoxified alcoholics. METHODS: Twenty male inpatients meeting DSM-III-R criteria for alcohol dependence and who had not consumed alcohol for 10 to 27 days prior to the study completed 3 test days that involved the intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.1 mg/kg or 0.5 mg/kg) or saline solution under randomized double-blind conditions. Ethanol-like subjective effects were assessed using the Sensation Scale; the Biphasic Alcohol Effects Scale; visual analog scales to measure ""high"" and degree of similarity to ethanol, cocaine, and marijuana; a scale assessing the number of standard alcohol drinks producing similar subjective effects; and visual analog scales measuring ethanol craving. RESULTS: Ketamine produced dose-related ethanol-like effects on each scale measuring its similarity to ethanol. Its effects were more similar to the sedative or descending limb effects of ethanol than to the stimulant or ascending limb effects. Ketamine effects also were more like ethanol than marijuana or cocaine. Ethanol-like effects were more prominent at the higher ketamine dose, a dose rated as similar to greater levels of ethanol intoxication. However, ketamine did not increase craving for ethanol. CONCLUSION: The production of ethanol-like subjective effects by ketamine supports the potential clinical importance of NMDA receptor antagonism among the mechanisms underlying the subjective effects of ethanol in humans."
"5832","1","Risks and benefits of psilocybin use in people with bipolar disorder: An international web-based survey on experiences of 'magic mushroom' consumption.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin, the primary psychoactive component of psychedelic 'magic mushrooms', may have potential for treating depressive symptoms, and consequent applications for bipolar disorder (BD). Knowledge of the risks and benefits of psilocybin in BD is limited to case studies. AIM: To support the design of clinical trials, we surveyed experiences of psilocybin use in people with BD. METHODS: An international web-based survey was used to explore experiences of psilocybin use in people with a self-reported diagnosis of BD. Quantitative findings were summarised using descriptive statistics. Qualitative content analysis was used to investigate free-text responses, with a focus on positive experiences of psilocybin use. RESULTS: A total of 541 people completed the survey (46.4% female, mean 34.1 years old). One-third (32.2%; n = 174) of respondents described new/increasing symptoms after psilocybin trips, prominently manic symptoms, difficulties sleeping and anxiety. No differences in rates of adverse events overall were observed between individuals with BD I compared to BD II. Use of emergency medical services was rare (n = 18; 3.3%), and respondents (even those who experienced adverse effects) indicated that psilocybin use was more helpful than harmful. Quantitative findings elaborated on perceived benefits, as well as the potential for psilocybin trips to contain both positively and negatively received elements. CONCLUSIONS: The subjective benefits of psilocybin use for mental health symptoms reported by survey participants encourage further investigation of psilocybin-based treatments for BD. Clinical trials should incorporate careful monitoring of symptoms, as data suggest that BD symptoms may emerge or intensify following psilocybin use."
"8970","1","Altered Insula Connectivity under MDMA.^\nRecent work with noninvasive human brain imaging has started to investigate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on large-scale patterns of brain activity. MDMA, a potent monoamine-releaser with particularly pronounced serotonin- releasing properties, has unique subjective effects that include: marked positive mood, pleasant/unusual bodily sensations and pro-social, empathic feelings. However, the neurobiological basis for these effects is not properly understood, and the present analysis sought to address this knowledge gap. To do this, we administered MDMA-HCl (100 mg p.o.) and, separately, placebo (ascorbic acid) in a randomized, double-blind, repeated-measures design with twenty-five healthy volunteers undergoing fMRI scanning. We then employed a measure of global resting-state functional brain connectivity and follow-up seed-to-voxel analysis to the fMRI data we acquired. Results revealed decreased right insula/salience network functional connectivity under MDMA. Furthermore, these decreases in right insula/salience network connectivity correlated with baseline trait anxiety and acute experiences of altered bodily sensations under MDMA. The present findings highlight insular disintegration (ie, compromised salience network membership) as a neurobiological signature of the MDMA experience, and relate this brain effect to trait anxiety and acutely altered bodily sensations-both of which are known to be associated with insular functioning."
"4783","1","Arketamine as adjunctive therapy for treatment-resistant depression: A placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nBackground: Racemic ketamine is a mixture of (R)-ketamine (arketamine) and (S)-ketamine (esketamine), with the latter regarded as the main isomer for antidepressant effects. However, preclinical data and one open-label human trial suggest arketamine might exert a more potent and longer-lasting antidepressant effect with fewer side effects. We aimed to explore the feasibility of a randomized controlled trial of arketamine for treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and to assess its efficacy and safety compared to placebo. Methods: This is a, randomized, double-blind, crossover, pilot trial (n = 10). All participants received saline and arketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a one-week interval. Treatment effects were analyzed with a linear mixed effects (LME) model. Results: Our analysis suggested the presence of a carryover effect, so the main efficacy analysis was limited to the first week, which demonstrated a main effect of time (p = 0.038) but not for treatment (p = 0.40) or their interaction (p = 0.95). This indicates that depression improved over time, but without significant difference between arketamine and placebo. Analyzing the two weeks together, findings were the same. Dissociation and other adverse events were minimal. Limitations: This was a pilot study with a small sample and underpowered. Conclusions: Arketamine was not superior to placebo for TRD but demonstrated to be extremely safe. Our findings reinforce the importance of continuing studies with this drug, with better powered clinical trials, perhaps considering a parallel design with higher or flexible doses and repeated administrations.

"6191","1","Naturalistic Study of Microdosing With Psilocybin.^\nSub‐threshold doses of serotonergic psychedelics are frequently consumed as cognitive enhancers, and due to their purported positive effects on mood, energy and creativity (""microdosing""). The acute and short‐term effects of psilocybin (the psychoactive compound of Psilocybe cubensis mushrooms) on several variables will be investigated, comprising spontaneous and evoked electrophysiological brain activity, perception and cognitive function (cognitive flexibility, attention, inhibitory control, conscious access, visual perception), creativity (problem solving, divergent and convergent thinking), behavior (actigraphy and sleep patterns, natural language production) and several domains related to well‐being and mental health of the participants. This study is simultaneously naturalistic (i.e. recruited subjects are intrinsically motivated to microdose, as they have decided to embark in a microdosing protocol) and controlled by expectations, following a double‐blind placebo‐controlled design. Participants will microdose according to the following schedule: Two sessions (0.5 g dried Psilocybin mushrooms vs. dried edible mushroom material without psychoactive effects as a placebo condition) will be conducted. A third party will be in charge of generating their active dose and placebo capsules, and they will also implement a blinding procedure. Each session will span one week of measurements. Subjects will be given a smartwatch to monitor activity and sleeping patterns at the beginning of the week. At days 3 and 5, subjects will take capsules with active mushroom material or placebo, and then several variables will be recorded. Experiments will be conducted in a setting that is natural and comfortable for the participants, e.g. their homes. The main outcome measures consist of resting state activity recorded with EEG, evoked response potentials and performance during cognitive tasks, behavioral variables obtained with actigraphy and automated sleep scoring, natural language analysis, and several measurs self‐reported via standarized questionnaires. After completion, this study will provide direct evidence concerning the efficacy of microdosing for cognitive enhancement under natural conditions, i.e. those most frequently used by individuals who microdose, as well as provide information concerning the potential underlying neurobiological mechanisms."
"2843","0","Chronic lithium exposure attenuates ketamine-induced mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the forebrain of mice.^\nKetamine, a dissociative anaesthetic, has been used in the treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) as a rapid acting antidepressant drug. Recent studies have shown that ketamine may increase the potential risk of treatment-induced mania in MDD patients. Lithium is a well-known mood stabilizer and has been widely used for the treatment of mania. It is not fully understood which forebrain regions are involved in ketamine- and lithium-induced expression of c-Fos. Therefore, our aim was to investigate the effect of chronic lithium treatment on mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the mouse forebrain activated by a single administration of ketamine. In the open field test, our results showed that ketamine significantly increased the total distance and total cumulative duration of movement in mice, while chronic lithium could attenuate these effects of ketamine. In addition, acute ketamine induced higher c-Fos expression in the lateral septal nucleus, hypothalamus, amygdala, and hippocampus of mice in the treatment group compared to those in the control group. However, chronic lithium inhibited the significant increase in c-Fos-immunoreactive neurons following acute ketamine administration in the dentate gyrus of the hippocampus, field CA1 of the hippocampus, dorsal subiculum, ventral subiculum, ventral subiculum, central amygdaloid nucleus and basolateral amygdaloid nucleus. In summary, our research shows that pretreatment with lithium moderates the effects of acute ketamine administration on mania-like behavior and c-Fos expression in the forebrain. These findings could be helpful in better understanding the episodes of mania related to ketamine treatment for MDD and bipolar disorder. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7100","0","Empirically validated theoretical analysis of visual-spatial perception under change of nervous system arousal.^\nIntroduction: Visual-spatial perception is a process for extracting the spatial relationship between objects in the environment. The changes in visual-spatial perception due to factors such as the activity of the sympathetic nervous system (hyperactivation) or parasympathetic nervous system (hypoactivation) can affect the internal representation of the external visual-spatial world. We formulated a quantitative model of the modulation of visual-perceptual space under action by hyperactivation or hypoactivation-inducing neuromodulating agents. We showed a Hill equation based relationship between neuromodulator agent concentration and alteration of visual-spatial perception utilizing the metric tensor to quantify the visual space. Methods: We computed the dynamics of the psilocybin (hyperactivation-inducing agent) and chlorpromazine (hypoactivation-inducing agent) in brain tissue. Then, we validated our quantitative model by analyzing the findings of different independent behavioral studies where subjects were assessed for alterations in visual-spatial perception under the action of psilocybin and under chlorpromazine. To validate the neuronal correlates, we simulated the effect of the neuromodulating agent on the computational model of the grid-cell network, and also performed diffusion MRI-based tractography to find the neural tracts between the cortical areas involved: V2 and the entorhinal cortex. Results: We applied our computational model to an experiment (where perceptual alterations were measured under psilocybin) and found that for n (Hill-coefficient) = 14.8 and k = 1.39, the theoretical prediction followed experimental observations very well (χ2 test robustly satisfied, p > 0.99). We predicted the outcome of another psilocybin-based experiment using these values (n = 14.8 and k = 1.39), whereby our prediction and experimental outcomes were well corroborated. Furthermore, we found that also under hypoactivation (chlorpromazine), the modulation of the visual-spatial perception follows our model. Moreover, we found neural tracts between the area V2 and entorhinal cortex, thus providing a possible brain network responsible for encoding visual-spatial perception. Thence, we simulated the altered grid-cell network activity, which was also found to follow the Hill equation. Conclusion: We developed a computational model of visuospatial perceptual alterations under altered neural sympathetic/parasympathetic tone. We validated our model using analysis of behavioral studies, neuroimaging assessment, and neurocomputational evaluation. Our quantitative approach may be probed as a potential behavioral screening and monitoring methodology in neuropsychology to analyze perceptual misjudgment and mishaps by highly stressed workers."

This is reinforced by the fact that the experiences in this study indicate that trained personnel can implement the psychedelic procedure with relatively high safety and replicate its major objective, the peak experience, to a degree that makes the phenomenon difficult to sweep under the experimental rug. At the same time, it underscores the need for controlled studies, an objective that may be very difficult to achieve in view of the unique nature of the drug experience and its therapeutic objective."
"7792","0","Psychedelic drugs – new approaches in the therapy of depression.^\nDepression is the most common psychological disease in our society, significantly impeding the quality of life of patients and their relatives. Since available antidepressants take multiple weeks to provide full mood-enhancing activities and often show only insufficient efficacy, current research investigates new drug classes with different modes of action to accelerate antidepressant efficiency particularly for suicidal emergencies and to overcome the therapeutic gap that exists for therapy resistance in the treatment of depression. In this context, psychedelics are in the focus of current clinical investigations because of their quick onset of action and promising efficacy in treatment of resistant depression. Simultaneously, further applications are discussed, e. g. adjunct treatment of alcohol withdrawal. The already approved esketamine as well as the hallucinogenic psilocybin, which is under experimental clinical investigation, are promising psychedelic drugs for the treatment of acute and therapy resistant major depression. Enhanced neurotrophin release and activity thereby enhancing neuronal plasticity that seems to play a pivotal role in the mechanism of action of these substances. Apart from ketamine and psilocybin there are also clinical trials on cannabis, LSD and MDMA for treatment of various psychiatric diseases, including major depression."
"7915","0","A preliminary investigation of ibogaine: Case reports and recommendations for further study.^\nA naturally occurring substance, ibogaine, was taken by seven individuals who were addicted to opiates. Ibogaine, an alkaloid with psychotropic effects at doses of 200-300 mg and above, was taken in single doses of 700-1800 mg by the subjects in the study. At the end of the 24-38-hr psychoactive period induced by the drug at these doses, none of the subjects displayed significant opiate withdrawal symptoms. At the lowest dose of 700 mg, one subject recontinued his drug abuse after 2 days; of the remaining six individuals who took 1,000 mg or above, two relapsed after a number of weeks, one reverted to intermittent heroin use, and three appear to have remained drug-free 14 weeks or more after undergoing this experimental treatment. Ibogaine may be of value in the present and could serve as a model for the development of improved agents for the treatment of substance abuse in the future."
"4143","1","Positive expectations predict improved mental-health outcomes linked to psychedelic microdosing.^\nPsychedelic microdosing describes the ingestion of near-threshold perceptible doses of classic psychedelic substances. Anecdotal reports and observational studies suggest that microdosing may promote positive mood and well-being, but recent placebo-controlled studies failed to find compelling evidence for this. The present study collected web-based mental health and related data using a prospective (before, during and after) design. Individuals planning a weekly microdosing regimen completed surveys at strategic timepoints, spanning a core four-week test period. Eighty-one participants completed the primary study endpoint. Results revealed increased self-reported psychological well-being, emotional stability and reductions in state anxiety and depressive symptoms at the four-week primary endpoint, plus increases in psychological resilience, social connectedness, agreeableness, nature relatedness and aspects of psychological flexibility. However, positive expectancy scores at baseline predicted subsequent improvements in well-being, suggestive of a significant placebo response. This study highlights a role for positive expectancy in predicting positive outcomes following psychedelic microdosing and cautions against zealous inferences on its putative therapeutic value."
"8753","0","NMDA antagonists for treating the non-motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease.^\nAmong patients with Parkinson's disease (PD), depression is prevalent and disabling, impacting both health outcomes and quality of life. There is a critical need for alternative pharmacological methods to treat PD depression, as mainstream antidepressant drugs are largely ineffective in this population. Currently, there are no recommendations for the optimal treatment of PD neuropsychiatric symptoms. Given the dual antidepressant and anti-dyskinetic effects of ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonists for PD, this review aims to examine the current evidence of NMDA antagonists for treating neuropsychiatric symptoms, including memantine, amantadine, ketamine, dizoclopine, and d-cycloserine. A comprehensive literature search was conducted using the PubMed database. We also searched the following databases up to March 1, 2018: Ovid MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Google Scholar, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews. The following keywords were used: NMDA antagonist and Parkinson's disease. Two authors independently reviewed the articles identified from the search using specific selection criteria, focusing on studies of mood, psychiatric condition, depression, cognition, and quality of life, and the consensus was reached on the 20 studies included. There is a preliminary evidence that NMDA antagonists may modulate psychiatric symptoms in PD. However, current evidence of psychiatric symptom-modifying effects is inconclusive and requires that further trials be conducted in PD. The repurposing of old NMDA antagonists, such as ketamine for depression and newer therapies, such as rapastinel, suggests that there is an emerging place for modulating the glutamatergic system for treating non-motor symptoms in PD."

The current study confirms that heavy illegal drug users are represented by a preponderance of males than females. However, within each drug group category, females generally reported higher psychopathology scores than males. This was significant for all three subscales in the alcohol/tobacco group, for depression scores in the alcohol/tobacco, cannabis/alcohol, and light Ecstasy users group, and for depression scores for the alcohol group. Interestingly, in the male sample, drug users reported higher symptom ratings than nondrug users, whereas women's scores remained constant across drug groups."
"1724","0","First drug-checking study at an electronic festival and fentanyl detection in the central region of Mexico.^\nBackground: Perception of drug adulteration has increased in Mexico, but there is little research on adulterants and toxicity. The aim of this study was to identify drug composition in an electronic music outdoor festival nearby Mexico City. Methods: The participants completed a questionnaire with demographic data, harm reduction strategies, drug-use patterns, history, and the drug they expected to find. We took a small sample of each substance and prepared it for drug checking. A two-section drug testing station was placed within the grounds of the festival. Interaction with participants occurred at the front part. Drug checking was conducted at the rear part. The service was free of charge, voluntary and confidential. Forty persons aged 22 to 48 years participated (mode = 28), of which 92.5% were male, most (82.5%) were single. Through the Substance Analysis Program of “ReverdeSer Collective,” we conducted the testing with the attendants that provided 51 drug samples, following ethical and biosafety protocols. We used colorimetry, Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, and fentanyl immunoassay strips for sample analysis. Results: Substances of choice among attendants were psychostimulants (MDMA and other amphetamine-like drugs) and hallucinogens. Most samples contained what the users expected plus adulterants. Main adulterants were methylene-dioxy-ethyl-amphetamine, methylene-dioxy-propyl-amphetamine, hydroxyamphetamine, and the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor venlafaxine. Fentanyl was present in 2 out of 4 cocaine samples and in 14 of the 22 confirmed MDMA samples. Conclusions: Some of the adulterants found pose serious health risks, especially fentanyl, amphetamine-like substances, and venlafaxine. Therefore, it is urgent to monitor these adulterants at electronic music festivals and to implement prevention, treatment, and harm reduction public policies. Naloxone distribution and drug-assisted therapies should be part of government programs in Mexico."
"5218","0","New Paradigms of Old Psychedelics in Schizophrenia.^\nPsychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin (magic mushrooms), and mescaline exhibit intense effects on the human brain and behaviour. In recent years, there has been a surge in studies investigating these drugs because clinical studies have shown that these once banned drugs are well tolerated and efficacious in medically supervised low doses called microdosing. Psychedelics have demonstrated efficacy in treating neuropsychiatric maladies such as difficult to treat anxiety, depression, mood disorders, obsessive compulsive disorders, suicidal ideation, posttraumatic stress disorder, and also in treating substance use disorders. The primary mode of action of psychedelics is activation of serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors affecting cognition and brain connectivity through the modulation of several downstream signalling pathways via complex molecular mechanisms. Some atypical antipsychotic drugs (APDs) primarily exhibit pharmacological actions through 5-HT(2A) receptors, which are also the target of psychedelic drugs. Psychedelic drugs including the newer second generation along with the glutamatergic APDs are thought to mediate pharmacological actions through a common pathway, i.e., a complex serotonin-glutamate receptor interaction in cortical neurons of pyramidal origin. Furthermore, psychedelic drugs have been reported to act via a complex interplay between 5HT(2A), mGlu2/3, and NMDA receptors to mediate neurobehavioral and pharmacological actions. Findings from recent studies have suggested that serotoninergic and glutamatergic neurotransmissions are very closely connected in producing pharmacological responses to psychedelics and antipsychotic medication. Emerging hypotheses suggest that psychedelics work through brain resetting mechanisms. Hence, there is a need to dig deeply into psychedelic neurobiology to uncover how psychedelics could best be used as scientific tools to benefit psychiatric disorders including schizophrenia."
"4243","0","A developmental approach to delineate components of cognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.^\nTwo developmentally based tests were devised to study the nature of schizophrenic cognitive dysfunction within a psychopharmacological framework and to relate the data to developmental and psychophysiological models. The Colour Form Preference Test was designed to evaluate cognitive style in terms of early maturational stages and provided a subscale for assessing arousal related cognitive disturbance. The Egocentricity of Thought Test, adapted from Piaget's developmental study of right-left positional concepts, enabled investigation in terms of the later stages of cognitive growth. These and other clinical measures were taken of schizophrenic patients at various points of treatment and also administered to a non psychotic comparison group. Test results supported their validity, reliability, longitudinal sensitivity and capacity for nosological and prognostic discriminations. The data also suggested a distinction between two components of schizophrenic cognitive dysfunction, viz. one drug sensitive, which could be considered as arousal related, and the other drug resistant, which might best be described as developmental. A two factor model encompassing the psychophysiological and developmental hypotheses is thus offered as a more comprehensive representation of the cognitive disorder."
"7642","1","Effects of ayahuasca on psychometric measures of anxiety, panic-like and hopelessness in Santo Daime members.^\nThe use of the hallucinogenic brew ayahuasca, obtained from infusing the shredded stalk of the malpighiaceous plant Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of other plants such as Psychotria viridis, is growing in urban centers of Europe, South and North America in the last several decades. Despite this diffusion, little is known about its effects on emotional states. The present study investigated the effects of ayahuasca on psychometric measures of anxiety, panic-like and hopelessness in members of the Santo Daime, an ayahuasca-using religion. Standard questionnaires were used to evaluate state-anxiety (STAI-state), trait-anxiety (STAI-trait), panic-like (ASI-R) and hopelessness (BHS) in participants that ingested ayahuasca for at least 10 consecutive years. The study was done in the Santo Daime church, where the questionnaires were administered 1h after the ingestion of the brew, in a double-blind, placebo-controlled procedure. While under the acute effects of ayahuasca, participants scored lower on the scales for panic and hopelessness related states. Ayahuasca ingestion did not modify state- or trait-anxiety. The results are discussed in terms of the possible use of ayahuasca in alleviating signs of hopelessness and panic-like related symptoms."
"403","1","Personality Traits in Former Spanish Substance Users Recovered with Ayahuasca.^\nAyahuasca is a psychoactive brew that contains N,N-dimethyltryptamine and monoamine oxidase-inhibiting alkaloids. It is originally from the Amazon rainforest, but since the 1990s it has expanded worldwide. The compound is used in different religious, spiritual, and therapeutic settings. One of its common applications is for the treatment of addiction. The current study is an assessment of the impact of ayahuasca on personality traits in former substance users from Catalonia and surrounding areas. When compared with a control group, the ayahuasca group had statistically significantly higher scores in the dimensions Novelty Seeking and Self-Transcendence, and in the traits Attachment, Impulsivity, Compassion, and Spiritual Acceptance. Results suggest that recovery could be related less to a reduction of Impulsivity and Novelty Seeking, main features of substance use disorder (SUD), and more to an increase of Character dimensions and traits, especially Self-Transcendence and Cooperativeness. Those changes could be triggered by self-reflective, prosocial, and transcendental ayahuasca ritual experiences, which in the qualitative part of the research were described by the participants as being of great importance for their recovery, helping with the reconstruction of personal goals, gratifications, social bonds, and the general life's projection."

Mephedrone is commonly consumed simultaneously with alcohol as other psychostimulants. The aim of the present study was to evaluate the interactions between mephedrone and ethanol in humans. Methods: Twelve healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants participated as outpatients in four experimental sessions. They received a single oral dose of mephedrone (200 mg) and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone placebo and alcohol (0.8 g/kg), mephedrone (200 mg) and placebo alcohol, and both placebos. Design was double‐blind, double‐dummy, randomized, cross‐over and controlled with placebo. Study variables included: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and pupil diameter), subjective effects (visual analogue scales‐VAS, ARCI‐49 item short form, and VESSPA questionnaire). Results: The combination produced a significant increase in the cardiovascular effects of mephedrone and induced more intense feeling of euphoria and well‐being in comparison to mephedrone and alcohol. Mephedrone reduced the drunkenness and sedation produced by alcohol. Conclusions: These results are similar to those obtained with the combination of other psychostimulants as amphetamines and MDMA. Abuse liability of the combination is greater that induced by mephedrone."
"2235","0","Ketamine, sleep, and depression: current status and new questions.^\nKetamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has well-described rapid antidepressant effects in clinical studies of individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (MDD). Preclinical studies investigating the effects of ketamine on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and on sleep slow wave activity (SWA) support its use as a prototype for investigating the neuroplastic mechanisms presumably involved in the mechanism of rapidly acting antidepressants. This review discusses human EEG slow wave sleep parameters and plasma BDNF as central and peripheral surrogate markers of plasticity, and their use in assessing ketamine's effects. Acutely, ketamine elevates BDNF levels, as well as early night SWA and high-amplitude slow waves; each of these measures correlates with change in mood in depressed patients who respond to ketamine. The slow wave effects are limited to the first night post-infusion, suggesting that their increase is part of an early cascade of events triggering improved mood. Increased total sleep and decreased waking occur during the first and second night post infusion, suggesting that these measures are associated with the enduring treatment response observed with ketamine."
"9242","1","Safety and Tolerability of the Acute Ketamine Treatment in Treatment-Resistant Depression: Focus on Comorbidities Interplay with Dissociation and Psychomimetic Symptoms.^\nThere is evidence for ketamine use in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Several safety concerns arise regarding adverse drug reactions in specific subpopulations. The aim of this study was to investigate the safety of intravenous ketamine treatment in relation to dissociative and psychotic measures in TRD inpatients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) and Bipolar depression (BP) with comorbidities. In total, 49 inpatients with MDD or BP were treated with ketamine following the registered naturalistic observational protocol in a tertiary reference unit for mood disorders (NCT04226963). This dataset represents an intermittent analysis of an observational study performed for interim modeling of observational learning. The observations were applied to the inhomogeneous TRD population in a single site with no blinding and were limited to acute administration. The presence of epilepsy was significantly associated with an elevation in the BPRS over time (p = 0.008). Psychotic symptomatology with BPRS scores for comorbid conditions excluding epilepsy turned out to be insignificant (p = 0.198) regardless of the diagnosis. However, for a subgroup of patients with epilepsy (n = 6), a substantial fluctuation was seen across all administrations in the time course of the study. The study results contribute to the literature on the safety and tolerability profile of CNS adverse drug reactions in short-term treatment with intravenous ketamine as an add-on intervention to current standard-of-care psychotropic medication in TRD-MDD and TRD-BP inpatients with comorbidities. The careful consideration of comorbidities and concomitant medication is needed with ketamine administration along with close-clinical supervision at every visit."
"7314","0","Experimental studies on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ECSTASY"") and its potential to damage brain serotonin neurons.^\nA number of drugs that fall into the broad category of ""ring-substituted amphetamines"" have been found to be neurotoxic toward brain monoamine neurons in animals. Several of these drugs, including (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") and methamphetamine (""speed"") and fenfluramine (""Pondimin"") have been used or abused by humans. A growing body of evidence indicates that humans, like animals, are susceptible to substituted amphetamine-induced neurotoxic injury, and that consequences of this injury can be subtle. This article will review the effects of ring-substituted amphetamine analogs on brain monoamine neurons, using MDMA as the prototype. Studies documenting MDMA neurotoxic potential toward brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals are summarized first. Human MDMA studies are then discussed, beginning with a consideration of methodological challenges in evaluating the status of 5-HT neurons in the living human brain. Recent findings indicating possible functional alterations in brain serotonergic systems in humans with a history of extensive MDMA exposure are then presented, including some new findings on sleep and personality in abstinent MDMA users."
"3786","1","Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination.^\nMethylphenidate and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') are widely misused psychoactive drugs. Methylphenidate increases brain dopamine and norepinephrine levels by blocking the presynaptic reuptake transporters. MDMA releases serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine through the same transporters. Pharmacodynamic interactions of methylphenidate and MDMA are likely. This study compared the pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic effects of methylphenidate and MDMA administered alone or in combination in healthy subjects using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Methylphenidate did not enhance the psychotropic effects of MDMA, although it produced psychostimulant effects on its own. The haemodynamic and adverse effects of co-administration of methylphenidate and MDMA were significantly higher compared with MDMA or methylphenidate alone. Methylphenidate did not change the pharmacokinetics of MDMA and vice versa. Methylphenidate and MDMA shared some subjective amphetamine-type effects; however, 125 mg of MDMA increased positive mood more than 60 mg of methylphenidate, and methylphenidate enhanced activity and concentration more than MDMA. Methylphenidate and MDMA differentially altered facial emotion recognition. Methylphenidate enhanced the recognition of sad and fearful faces, whereas MDMA reduced the recognition of negative emotions. Additionally, the present study found acute pharmacodynamic tolerance to MDMA but not methylphenidate. In conclusion, the combined use of methylphenidate and MDMA does not produce more psychoactive effects compared with either drug alone, but potentially enhances cardiovascular and adverse effects. The findings may be of clinical importance for assessing the risks of combined psychostimulant misuse.

"3647","1","Impairment of specific episodic memory processes by sub-psychotic doses of ketamine: The effects of levels of processing at encoding and of the subsequent retrieval task.^\nRationale: The precise nature of the impact of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, ketamine, upon human episodic memory, has yet to be elucidated fully. Objectives: This study sought to assess the effects of ketamine on the sub-processes facilitating memory encoding and retrieval. Methods: We evaluated the effects of the drug on a series of memory performance measures depending upon whether it was administered at the encoding or retrieval stage and on the nature of the encoding task used. Twelve healthy volunteers participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, within-subjects study. Intravenous infusions of placebo, 50 ng/ml ketamine or 100 ng/ml ketamine were administered. We investigated the effects of ketamine on three key aspects of episodic memory: encoding vs retrieval processes, source memory, and depth of processing. Data were analysed using both multinomial modelling and standard measures of item discrimination and response bias. Results: Deleterious effects of ketamine on episodic memory were primarily attributable to its effects on encoding, rather than retrieval processes. Recognition memory was impaired for items encoded at an intermediate level of processing, but preserved for shallowly and deeply encoded items. Increased source guessing bias was also observed when encoding took place under ketamine. Conclusions: The effects of ketamine upon episodic memory seem, therefore, to predominate at encoding. Furthermore, our results are also consistent with a specific impairment of encoding processes that result in subsequent recollective, as opposed to familiarity-based, retrieval. The observed effects are compatible with memory deficits seen in schizophrenia and thus provide some support for the ketamine model of the disease.

"1659","1","Novel uses of ketamine in the emergency department.^\nIntroduction Ketamine is gaining renewed interest among healthcare providers in the emergency department (ED) setting due to its novel clinical applications. Areas covered This article provides a comprehensive discussion of ketamine's pharmacological properties, safety profile, and an overview of current evidence for ketamine in the management of ED patients with acute agitation, pain, depression/suicide ideation. Expert opinion Ketamine is an effective adjunct to opioids, providing greater pain relief than morphine alone. Ketamine (0.1-0.3 mg/kg IV) alone can provide analgesia similar to that of morphine in patients with acute visceral and musculoskeletal pain, as well as for chronic painful conditions (cancer, vaso-occlusive pain crisis associated with sickle cell disease, and in patients with high opioid tolerance and/or opioid dependency). Available literature shows that ketamine (1-2 mg/kg IV or 4-5 mg/kg IM) is a safe, rapid (<5 minutes) and effective tranquilization agent for ED patients with acute agitation. Finally, there is growing evidence that suggests ketamine may have potential utility in the management of patients with self-harm ideation or acute depressive episodes. Intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 mins) has been shown to produce an antidepressant effect and decrease in suicidal ideation within 4 hours with effects lasting up to one week."
"1584","0","Acute and long-term effects of MDMA on cerebral dopamine biochemistry and function.^\nRATIONALE AND OBJECTIVES: The majority of experimental and clinical studies on the pharmacology of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) tend to focus on its action on 5-HT biochemistry and function. However, there is considerable evidence for MDMA having marked acute effects on dopamine release. Furthermore, while MDMA produces long-term effects on 5-HT neurones in most species examined, in mice its long-term effects appear to be restricted to the dopamine system. The objective of this review is to examine the actions of MDMA on dopamine biochemistry and function in mice, rats, guinea pigs, monkeys and humans. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: MDMA appears to produce a major release of dopamine from its nerve endings in all species investigated. This release plays a significant role in the expression of many of the behaviours that occur, including behavioural changes, alterations of the mental state in humans and the potentially life-threatening hyperthermia that can occur. While MDMA appears to be a selective 5-HT neurotoxin in most species examined (rats, guinea pigs and primates), it is a selective dopamine neurotoxin in mice. Selectivity may be a consequence of what neurotoxic metabolites are produced (which may depend on dosing schedules), their selectivity for monoamine nerve endings, or the endogenous free radical trapping ability of specific nerve endings, or both. We suggest more focus be made on the actions of MDMA on dopamine neurochemistry and function to provide a better understanding of the acute and long-term consequences of using this popular recreational drug."
"1816","0","Religion and drug use by adolescents.^\nIntroduction: Many international studies show that religion is an important dimension modulating the use of alcohol and drugs by adolescents. Objectives: to determine which religious variables are associated to frequent or heavy use of alcohol, tobacco and drugs among adolescents in intermediate and high schools in Campinas, Brazil. Methods: A cross-sectional study using a self-report anonymous questionnaire was administered to 2.287 students from a convenience sample of seven schools: five from central areas (two public and three private schools) and two public schools from the outskirts of the city, in 1998. The study analyzes data regarding the use of alcohol, tobacco, medicines, solvents, marijuana, cocaine and ecstasy. The religious variables included in the regression analysis were: religious affiliation, church attendance, self-assessed religiousness, and religious education in childhood. For the substances, nicotine, alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy and ""abuse of medicines"" a logistic regression analysis for dicotomic answer was applied. Results: The heavy use of at least one drug during the last month was more frequent among students that did not have a religious education during childhood. The use in the last month of cocaine, ecstasy and (abuse of) medicines was more frequent among those students that had no religion (cocaine and medicines) and that did not have a religious education during childhood (ecstasy and medicines). Conclusions: this study is consistent with previous investigations demonstrating a strong influence of religious variables over the use of drugs among adolescents. Interesting, it was found that no or weaker religious education during childhood was markedly associated with significant more use of drugs during adolescence."
"507","0","Cannabis use and other illicit drug use: Do subjective experiences during first cannabis use increase the probability of using illicit drug?.^\nBackground and aims: Few studies have examined whether subjective experiences during first cannabis use are related to other illicit drug (OID) use. This study investigated this topic. Methods: Baseline data from a representative sample of young Swiss men was obtained from an ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors (N=5753). Logistic regressions were performed to examine the relationships between cannabis use and of subjective experiences during first cannabis use with 15 OID. Results: Positive experiences increased the likelihood of using hallucinogens (hallucinogens, salvia divinorum, spice; p<0.015), stimulants (speed, ecstasy, cocaine, amphetamines/methamphetamines; p<0.006) and also poppers, research chemicals, GHB/GBL, and crystal meth (p<0.049). Sniffed drugs (poppers, solvents for sniffing) and ""hard"" drugs (heroin, ketamine, research chemicals, GHB/GBL and crystal meth) were more likely to be used by participants who experienced negative feelings on first use of cannabis (p<0.034). Conclusion: Subjective feelings seemed to amplify the association of cannabis with OID. The risk increased for drugs with effects resembling feelings experienced on first cannabis use. Negative experiences should also be a concern, as they were associated with increased risk of using the ""hardest"" illicit drugs."

The psilocybin or placebo is administered within a protocol of psychological support before, during and after the dosing. Outcome assessments will be carried out one, four, eight‐ and 12 weeks post dosing. The primary outcome is reduction in the percentage of heavy drinking days from baseline to follow‐up at 12 weeks. Key secondary outcomes include 1) phosphatidyl‐ethanol as an objective biomarker for alcohol consumption 2) plasma psilocin, the active metabolite, to establish a possible therapeutic range and 3) the acute subjective drug experience as a possible predictor of treatment outcome. Furthermore, we will investigate the neurobiological underpinnings of the possible treatment effects by use of functional magnetic resonance brain imaging one week post dosing."

Design and Methods: A Queensland, Australia, five-bed state-wide voluntary adolescent drug and alcohol withdrawal service collected routine clinical pre-entry data over a period of 9 years (2000–2009) on 524 subjects. Potential predictors of program completion included socio-demographic, family functioning, past mental health history, mental health problems on admission, and patterns of drug use variables. The chi-square analysis identified significant predictors with subsequent multivariate logistic regression modeling. Given the loss of data, additional multiple imputation logistic regression analysis was utilized. Results: Initial predictors were aged 17 and over; a past history of psychiatric treatment or violence or assault; mental health problems identified on entry; absence of current alcohol use or ecstasy use. After regression and multiple imputation modeling, predictors were a history of psychiatric treatment and of violence/assault. Discussion and Conclusions: A history of co-morbidity rather than traditional markers of good outcomes such as sex, ethnic background, income support, and housing support predicted program retention. The study reinforces the important role of non-substance psychiatry co-morbidity in the treatment of substance use disorder."
"404","0","More than meets the eye: The role of sensory dimensions in psychedelic brain dynamics, experience, and therapeutics.^\nPsychedelics are undergoing a major resurgence of scientific and clinical interest. While multiple theories and frameworks have been proposed, there is yet no universal agreement on the mechanisms underlying the complex effects of psychedelics on subjective experience and brain dynamics, nor their therapeutic benefits. Despite being prominent in psychedelic phenomenology and distinct from those elicited by other classes of hallucinogens, the effects of psychedelics on low-level sensory - particularly visual - dimensions of experience, and corresponding brain dynamics, have often been disregarded by contemporary research as 'epiphenomenal byproducts'. Here, we review available evidence from neuroimaging, pharmacology, questionnaires, and clinical studies; we propose extensions to existing models, provide testable hypotheses for the potential therapeutic roles of psychedelic-induced visual hallucinations, and simulations of visual phenomena relying on low-level cortical dynamics. In sum, we show that psychedelic-induced alterations in low-level sensory dimensions 1) are unlikely to be entirely causally reconducible to high-level alterations, but rather co-occur with them in a dialogical interplay, and 2) are likely to play a causally relevant role in determining high-level alterations and therapeutic outcomes. We conclude that reevaluating the currently underappreciated role of sensory dimensions in psychedelic states will be highly valuable for neuroscience and clinical practice, and that integrating low-level and domain-specific aspects of psychedelic effects into existing nonspecific models is a necessary step to further understand how these substances effect both acute and long-term change in the human brain."
"1146","0","Effects of salvinorin A, a κ-opioid hallucinogen, on a neuroendocrine biomarker assay in nonhuman primates with high κ-receptor homology to humans.^\nThis study focused on the in vivo effects of the κ-opioid hallucinogen salvinorin A, derived from the plant Salvia divinorum. The effects of salvinorin A (0.0032-0.056 mg/kg i.v.) were studied in a neuroendocrine biomarker assay of the anterior pituitary hormone prolactin in gonadally intact, adult male and female rhesus monkeys (n = 4 each). Salvinorin A produced dose- and time-dependent neuroendocrine effects, similar to the synthetic high-efficacy κ-agonist U69,593 ((+)-(5α,7 α,8β)-N- methyl-N-[7-(1-pyrrolidiniyl)-1-oxaspiro[4.5]dec-8yl]-benzeneacetamide), but of shorter duration than the latter. Salvinorin A was approximately equipotent to U69,593 in this endpoint (salvinorin A ED50, 0.015 mg/kg; U69,593 ED50, 0.0098 mg/kg). The effects of i.v. salvinorin A were not prevented by a small dose of the opioid antagonist nalmefene (0.01 mg/kg s.c.) but were prevented by a larger dose of nalmefene (0.1 mg/kg); the latter nalmefene dose is sufficient to produce κ-antagonist effects in this species. In contrast, the 5HT2 receptor antagonist ketanserin (0.1 mg/kg i.m.) did not prevent the effects of salvinorin A. As expected, the neuroendocrine effects of salvinorin A (0.0032 mg/kg i.v.) were more robust in female than in male subjects. Related studies focused on full-length cloning of the coding region of the rhesus monkey κ-opioid receptor (OPRK1) gene and revealed a high homology of the nonhuman primate OPRK1 gene compared with the human OPRK1 gene, including particular C-terminal residues thought to be involved in receptor desensitization and internalization. The present studies indicate that the hallucinogen salvinorin A acts as a high-efficacy κ-agonist in nonhuman primates in a translationally viable neuroendocrine biomarker assay.

"7831","0","Detoxification of opiate addicts with multiple drug abuse: a comparison of buprenorphine vs. methadone.^\nOver the last few years, there has been a growing tendency for opioid addicts to abuse multiple drugs, although many patients are in substitution therapy with methadone. Abuse of multiple drugs leads to a more complicated withdrawal syndrome; it is therefore necessary to investigate new drug strategies as a treatment for detoxification. Buprenorphine appears to be an effective and safe drug in opioid‐addicted patient detoxification. In this study, we have compared the short‐term efficacy of an 11‐day low‐dose buprenorphine/14‐day carbamazepine regime [BPN/CBZ] (n = 14) to an 11‐day methadone/14‐day carbamazepine regime [MET/CBZ] (n = 12) in a double‐dummy, randomized 14‐day inpatient detoxification treatment study. Twenty‐six inpatients met the DSM‐IV criteria for opioid dependence and were included in this study. All patients abused various additional drugs. Fourteen of 26 patients (53.8 %) completed the study. Seven non‐completers (seven of 12 = 58.3 %) were treated with methadone/carbamazepine and five non‐completers (five of 14 = 35.7 %) received buprenorphine/carbamazepine, but the difference in the dropout rate was not significant. However, patients with buprenorphine/carbamazepine showed significantly fewer withdrawal symptoms after the first two weeks of treatment. The present study supports the hypothesis that buprenorphine/carbamazepine is more effective than methadone/carbamazepine in detoxification strategies for opioid addict with additional multiple drug abuse. No severe side effects occurred during treatment in either group."

Pahnke (1963) administered psilocybin or placebo to 20 White male Protestant divinity students before Good Friday services. The present study critiques the preparation phase of the experiment, Pahnke's questionnaire for measuring mystical experience, and completeness of his reporting. Between 1986 and 1989, the present author recorded personal interviews with 16 of the original Ss. All 16 were readministered the 100-item questionnaire used for 6-mo follow-up in the original experiment. The original experiment found that psilocybin Ss who experienced a mystical experience would, after 6 mo, report a substantial amount of positive, and virtually no negative, persisting changes in attitude and behavior. The present study further supports these findings. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"
"670","1","Urine Mescaline Screening With a Biochip Array Immunoassay and Quantification by Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry.^\nMescaline, the primary psychoactive chemical in peyote cactus, has been consumed for thousands of years in ancient religious ceremonies. The US military wanted to determine if mescaline intake was a problem for personnel readiness. Twenty thousand seventeen urine specimens negative for cannabinoids, cocaine, opiates, and amphetamines were tested for mescaline with the Randox Drugs of Abuse V (DOA-V) biochip array immunoassay at the manufacturer's recommended cutoff of 6 mcg/L. A sensitive and specific method for mescaline quantification in urine was developed and fully validated. Extracted analytes were derivatized with pentafluoropropionic anhydride and pentafluoropropanol and quantified by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS) with electron impact ionization. Standard curves, using linear least squares regression with 1/x weighting, were linear from 1 to 250 mcg/L with coefficients of determination >0.994. Intra- and inter-assay imprecision was <4.4 coefficient of variation (%CV), with accuracies >90.4%. Mean extraction efficiencies were >92.0% across the linear range. This fully validated method was applied for the confirmation of urinary mescaline in 526 presumptive-positive specimens and 198 randomly selected presumptive-negative specimens at the manufacturer's 6 mcg/L cutoff. No specimen confirmed positive at the GC/MS limit of quantification of 1 mcg/L. Results indicated that during this time frame, there was insufficient mescaline drug use in the military to warrant routine screening in the drug testing program. However, mescaline stability, although assessed, could have contributed to lower prevalence. We also present a validated GC/MS method for mescaline quantification in urine for reliable confirmation of suspected mescaline intake."
"782","1","Spatiotemporal brain dynamics of emotional face processing modulations induced by the serotonin 1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin.^\nEmotional face processing is critically modulated by the serotonergic system. For instance, emotional face processing is impaired by acute psilocybin administration, a serotonin (5-HT) 1A and 2A receptor agonist. However, the spatiotemporal brain mechanisms underlying these modulations are poorly understood. Here, we investigated the spatiotemporal brain dynamics underlying psilocybin-induced modulations during emotional face processing. Electrical neuroimaging analyses were applied to visual evoked potentials in response to emotional faces, following psilocybin and placebo administration. Our results indicate a first time period of strength (i.e., Global Field Power) modulation over the 168-189 ms poststimulus interval, induced by psilocybin. A second time period of strength modulation was identified over the 211-242 ms poststimulus interval. Source estimations over these 2 time periods further revealed decreased activity in response to both neutral and fearful faces within limbic areas, including amygdala and parahippocampal gyrus, and the right temporal cortex over the 168-189 ms interval, and reduced activity in response to happy faces within limbic and right temporo-occipital brain areas over the 211-242 ms interval. Our results indicate a selective and temporally dissociable effect of psilocybin on the neuronal correlates of emotional face processing, consistent with a modulation of the top-down control."
"794","1","Individuals with high trait negative emotionality are more sensitive to the subjective effects of a microdose of LSD.^\nBackground: Numerous anecdotal reports suggest that repeated use of very low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), known as ""microdosing,"" improves mood and cognitive function. Yet, the behavioral, neural, and subjective effects of low doses of LSD have only recently been tested in a controlled laboratory setting, and little is known about inter‐individual variability in the drug's effects. We have examined the effects of single low doses of LSD on mood and behavior in healthy volunteers under double‐blind conditions. Here we report on individual differences in responses to a single low dose LSD (13μg) in relation to personality traits. Methods: As part of two studies, healthy young men and women (N = 35) attended laboratory sessions during which they received placebo or 13μg LSD in separate sessions at one‐week intervals, under double blind conditions in mixed order. Subjects completed mood questionnaires and behavioral tasks assessing emotion processing and cognition during the sessions. They completed the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire at the end of each session, and the Multiphasic Personality Questionnaire (MPQ) at intake. Results: LSD produced modest subjective effects, including increases on ratings of ""feel drug"" and ""feel high"" and on the ""Blissful State"" domain of the Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire. These subjective effects were most pronounced in individuals who scored high on Negative Emotionality on the MPQ (r = 0.37 p = 0.03; r = 0.37 p = 0.03; r = 0.45 p = 0.01). Conclusions: A threshold ""microdose"" of LSD (13μg) produced modest subjective effects in healthy volunteers and these effects were strongest among individuals with high negative emotionality scores. These findings are consistent with the idea that the drug improves mood in individuals with symptoms of depression."
"4661","1","Epidemiology of classic psychedelic substances: results from a Norwegian internet convenience sample.^\nOBJECTIVE: In recent years, there has been a renewed interest in investigating the use of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, knowledge about the epidemiology of classic psychedelics in the Nordic countries is limited. METHODS: We recruited adult, Norwegian participants who have had a memorable experience after taking a classic psychedelic substance. They filled in an anonymous internet survey with 119 items covering matters related to recreational use of psychedelics using a secure, web-based application. Data are presented by using descriptive statistics (frequencies, means, and standard deviations). RESULTS: We recruited 841 participants, 770 (72% male; 88% 45 years or younger) of which were included in the data analysis. The intentions behind taking the psychedelic substance were mainly recreational (46.1%) or therapeutic (42.3%). Most participants reported that their most memorable experience was with psilocybin. As in modern era clinical trials, most participants were well-prepared before, did processing during, and did integration work after the experience, whereas only a minority were supported by a therapist. Self-perceived symptoms of various mental disorders and substance use disorders were prevalent in the sample. Most subjects reported improvements in their condition. Although adverse reactions were usually mild and short-lived, 4.2% lasted for 1 year or more. Persisting flashbacks were present for a year or more among 2.9% of the participants. CONCLUSION: In this cross-sectional sample of Norwegian, self-selecting adults, we shed light on what characterizes the most memorable experience with a classic psychedelic substance, including short- and long-term risks and benefits. For the most part, the psychedelic experience led to improvements in self-perceived symptoms of mental disorders and substance use disorders. However, a small subset experienced persisting adverse reactions."
"8187","1","Psychedelics and Hallucinogens in Psychiatry: Finding New Pharmacological Targets.^\nBACKGROUND: The therapeutic options for neurobehavioral disorders are still limited, and in many cases, they lack a satisfactory balance between efficacy and side effects. OBJECTIVES: This work aims to review current evidence regarding the potential contribution of psychedelics and hallucinogens to the discovery of new drugs for treating different psychiatric disorders. DISCUSSION: Ayahuasca/N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), and psilocybin have evidence supporting their use in depression, and psilocybin and ayahuasca have also shown good results in treatment-resistant depression. In randomized controlled trials (RCTs) conducted with anxious patients, there were symptomatic improvements with psilocybin and LSD. Psilocybin diminished Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS) scores in a small obsessive- compulsive disorder (OCD) sample. The evidence is less robust regarding substance use disorders, but it suggests a possible role for LSD and psilocybin in alcohol use disorders and for psilocybin in tobacco addiction. In a clinical setting, these substances seem to be safe and well-tolerated. Their mechanisms of action are not fully elucidated, but there seems to be a preponderant role of 5-hydroxytryptamine (5HT) 2A agonism, as well as connectivity changes within the default mode network (DMN) and amygdala and some other molecular modifications. CONCLUSION: The studies underlying the conclusions have small samples and are heterogeneous in their methods. However, the results suggest that the use of psychedelics and hallucinogens could be considered in some disorders. More studies are needed to reinforce their evidence as potential new drugs."
"2333","0","Reducing substance use improves adolescents' school attendance.^\nAIMS: Substance use initiation and frequency are associated with reduced educational attainments among adolescents. We examined if decreases in substance use substantially improve youths' school attendance. DESIGN: A total of 1084 US adolescents followed quarterly for 1 year after entering substance abuse treatment. METHODS: Random and fixed effects regression models were used to differentiate the lagged effects of drug use from other time-varying and time-invariant covariates. Self-reports of alcohol, marijuana, stimulants, sedatives, hallucinogens and other drug use were used to predict subsequent school attendance, after controlling for demographic and drug use history characteristics, problem indices and other covariates. FINDINGS: Reductions in the frequency of alcohol, stimulants and other drug use and the elimination of marijuana use were each associated independently with increased likelihoods of school attendance. CONCLUSIONS: Because years of completed schooling is highly correlated with long-term social and economic outcomes, the possibility that reductions in substance use may improve school attendance has significant implications for the cost-effectiveness of substance abuse treatment and other interventions designed to reduce adolescents' substance use."
"1295","1","Greater empathy in MDMA users.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is widely known for its positive acute effects on social behaviour, such as increasing empathy, whilst also attenuating the negative impact of social exclusion. However there is a scarcity of research that investigates the long-term impact of recreational MDMA use on these fundamental social processes. Method: Sixty-seven individuals were split into three groups based on their drug-use history: poly-drug MDMA users (n = 25), poly-drug users who do not use MDMA (n = 19), alcohol-only users (n = 23), and were tested in an independent groups design. Participants completed both a self-report measure of emotional and cognitive empathy, along with the Multifaceted Empathy Task – a computerised assessment of empathy – and the Cyberball Game – a social exclusion paradigm. Results: MDMA users had significantly greater subjective emotional empathy, and greater cognitive empathy on the computer task compared with the poly-drug users who do not use MDMA. There were no significant differences in subjective responses to social exclusion between the groups. Indices of MDMA use did not correlate with empathy. Conclusions: Long-term MDMA users in this sample exhibited normal psychosocial functioning in regard to empathy and social pain and had higher subjective emotional empathy. This conflicts with previous suggestions that moderate, long-term MDMA use may cause heightened social distress, and is further evidence of the safety of the drug, which is relevant to considerations of its therapeutic use."

This study examined the relative abuse potential of CR845 compared to placebo or pentazocine, a schedule IV opioid analgesic. Recreational polydrug users with experience with opioids and hallucinogenic agents were enrolled in this single‐center, randomized, double‐blind, active‐ and placebo‐controlled study. Thirty‐nine subjects received a single bolus IV dose of the following 4 treatments in random order: CR845 5 mcg/kg (therapeutic dose), CR845 15 mcg/kg (supra‐therapeutic dose), placebo, and pentazocine 0.5 mg/kg. Treatments were separated by 48‐hour washout period. Drug liking bipolar Visual Analog Scale (VAS) was the primary measurement, and was assessed periodically between 5 minutes and 8 hours after dosing. This trial met the primary endpoint with drug liking scores for pentazocine significantly greater than that of placebo and either doses of CR845 (P<0.0001 for each comparison to pentazocine). The least squares (LS) mean for the maximum drug liking VAS (Emax) scores (6standard error of LS mean) were 87.6±1.9 for pentazocine, 65.3±1.9 for CR845 5 mcg/kg, 66.9±1.9 for CR845 15 mcg/kg, and 52.4±1.9 for placebo, indicating that both doses of CR845 had significantly lower drug liking response compared to pentazocine. Additional bipolar VAS measurements were lower for CR845 compared with pentazocine for ''overall drug liking'' (P<0.0001 for both doses of CR845) and ''take drug again'' (P<0.0003 for CR845 5 mcg/kg and P<0.0001 for CR845 15 mcg/kg). These VAS scores for CR845 were equivalent for both doses and were similar to those of placebo. These results suggest that the novel and selective peripherally acting kappa agonist CR845 may present a low risk for abuse liability in humans. Sponsored by Cara Therapeutics."
"4344","0","Evidence of 2 populations of mephedrone abusers by hair testing. Application to 4 forensic expertises.^\nBackground: New psychoactive substances are conquering the drug scene. Among these substances, cathinone derivatives have been observed since late in the years 2000. At that time, there was evidence of increasing use of the synthetic cathinone mephedrone, particularly amongst clubbers. Although the emergent drugs have an aura of safety, there is an increasing amount of experiences on their secondary effects. Mephedrone is known to induce psychosis. Method: Given the potential negative effects of mephedrone, the laboratory was asked to test for the drug in hair, a cumulative matrix that can document single, occasional or repetitive abuse of xenobiotics. Mephedrone was tested in hair by GC/MS, using a standard procedure developed for stimulants such as amphetamine or ecstasy. Results: In the head hair of 24 positive abusers, mephedrone was identified in the range 0.1 to 87 ng/mg, clearly determining 2 populations, one with co-administration of ecstasy and a second without ecstasy. In the first population, mephedrone concentrations were 0.1 to 5 ng/mg; in the second population, mephedrone concentrations were 3 to 87 ng/mg. These findings should help in the understanding the addiction of subjects. In 4 separate forensic cases, mephedrone was identified in hair of abusers, including a rape case (0.54 ng/mg), a fatal car crash (0.38 ng/mg), a fatal drowning (1.21 ng/mg), and a fatal overdose (6.99 ng/mg). Conclusion: Hair testing for new psychoactive substances appears as a good complement to standard urine analyses. This study confirms the increasing diffusion of new drugs among the forensic population of abusers."
"3243","0","Psychedelics, placebo effects, and set and setting: Insights from common factors theory of psychotherapy.^\nPsychedelic-assisted treatment is at first glance markedly different in structure and approach from mainstream forms of psychotherapy in the West. A major criticism of clinical psychedelic research rests on the difficulty of executing placebo-controlled studies and distinguishing drug effects from those of the psychotherapeutic container in which psychedelics are typically presented. Detractors also tend to find fault in spiritual or mystical themes that often arise in the context of psychedelic use. Common factors theory of psychotherapy is a useful and extensively studied framework that can help make sense of these issues, and has much to contribute to our understanding of contextual effects that are often discussed in psychedelic literature as ""set and setting."" In this article, we examine four major contextual ""common factors"" shared by various healing traditions: 1) the therapeutic relationship; 2) the healing setting; 3) the rationale, conceptual scheme, or myth; and 4) the ritual. We explain how these factors show up in psychedelic-assisted treatment and how they may contribute to therapeutic effects. Lastly, we discuss the implications of these factors for the concept of placebo, and for future research."
"520","1","Investigating the mechanisms of hallucinogen-induced visions using 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA): a randomized controlled trial in humans.^\nBACKGROUND: The mechanisms of drug-induced visions are poorly understood. Very few serotonergic hallucinogens have been studied in humans in decades, despite widespread use of these drugs and potential relevance of their mechanisms to hallucinations occurring in psychiatric and neurological disorders. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: We investigated the mechanisms of hallucinogen-induced visions by measuring the visual and perceptual effects of the hallucinogenic serotonin 5-HT2AR receptor agonist and monoamine releaser, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), in a double-blind placebo-controlled study. We found that MDA increased self-report measures of mystical-type experience and other hallucinogen-like effects, including reported visual alterations. MDA produced a significant increase in closed-eye visions (CEVs), with considerable individual variation. Magnitude of CEVs after MDA was associated with lower performance on measures of contour integration and object recognition. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Drug-induced visions may have greater intensity in people with poor sensory or perceptual processing, suggesting common mechanisms with other hallucinatory syndromes. MDA is a potential tool to investigate mystical experiences and visual perception. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov NCT00823407."
"7253","1","Ketamine as a potential treatment for suicidal ideation: a systematic review of the literature.^\nOBJECTIVE: To review the published literature on the efficacy of ketamine for the treatment of suicidal ideation (SI). METHODS: The PubMed and Cochrane databases were searched up to January 2015 for clinical trials and case reports describing therapeutic ketamine administration to patients presenting with SI/suicidality. Searches were also conducted for relevant background material regarding the pharmacological function of ketamine. RESULTS: Nine publications (six studies and three case reports) met the search criteria for assessing SI after administration of subanesthetic ketamine. There were no studies examining the effect on suicide attempts or death by suicide. Each study demonstrated a rapid and clinically significant reduction in SI, with results similar to previously described data on ketamine and treatment-resistant depression. A total of 137 patients with SI have been reported in the literature as receiving therapeutic ketamine. Seven studies delivered a dose of 0.5 mg/kg intravenously over 40 min, while one study administered a 0.2 mg/kg intravenous bolus and another study administered a liquid suspension. The earliest significant results were seen after 40 min, and the longest results were observed up to 10 days postinfusion. CONCLUSION: Consistent with clinical research on ketamine as a rapid and effective treatment for depression, ketamine has shown early preliminary evidence of a reduction in depressive symptoms, as well as reducing SI, with minimal short-term side effects. Additional studies are needed to further investigate its mechanism of action, long-term outcomes, and long-term adverse effects (including abuse) and benefits. In addition, ketamine could potentially be used as a prototype for further development of rapid-acting antisuicidal medication with a practical route of administration and the most favorable risk/benefit ratio."
"1676","1","Test-re-test reliability of DSM-IV adopted criteria for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse and dependence: A cross-national study.^\nAims This study evaluated the prevalence and reliability of DSM-IV adopted criteria for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) abuse and dependence with a purpose to determine whether it is best conceptualized within the category of hallucinogens, amphetamines or its own category. Design Test-re-test study. Participants MDMA users (life-time use >5 times) were recruited in St Louis, Miami and Sydney (n = 593). The median life-time MDMA consumption was 50 pills at the baseline. Measurements The computerized Substance Abuse Module for Club Drug (CD-SAM) was used to assess MDMA abuse and dependence. The Discrepancy Interview Protocol (DIP) was used to determine the reasons for the discrepant responses between the two interviews. Reliability of diagnoses, individual diagnostic criteria and withdrawal symptoms was examined using the kappa coefficient (κ). Findings For baseline data, 15% and 59% met MDMA abuse and dependence, respectively. Substantial test-re-test reliability of the diagnoses was observed consistently across cities (κ = 0.69). 'Continued use despite knowledge of physical/psychological problems' (87%) and 'withdrawal' (68%) were the two most prevalent dependence criteria. 'Physically hazardous use' was the most prevalent abuse criterion. Six dependence criteria and all abuse criteria were reported reliably across cities (κ: 0.53-0.77). Seventeen of 19 withdrawal symptoms showed consistency in the reliability across cities. The most commonly reported reason for discrepant responses was 'interpretation of question changed'. Only a small proportion of the total discrepancies were attributed to lying or social desirability. Conclusion The adopted DSM-IV diagnostic classification for MDMA abuse and dependence was moderately reliable across cities. Findings on MDMA withdrawal support the argument that MDMA should be separated from other hallucinogens in DSM. © 2009 Society for the Study of Addiction."

This article will first provide a brief review of the research literature providing direct and indirect support for the possible therapeutic effects of classic hallucinogens such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in the treatment of addictions. Having provided a rationale for clinical investigation in this area, we discuss design issues in clinical trials using classic hallucinogens, some of which are unique to this class of drug. We then discuss the current status of this field of research and design considerations in future randomized trials."
"5158","1","Self-administration of Psilocybin in the Setting of Treatment-resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Patients diagnosed with major depressive disorder (MDD) who fail to respond to two or more antidepressants are often considered to have treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Many of the current options for TRD have significant side effect profiles, are expensive, and are difficult to access. There has been a revival of psychedelic research in recent years that shows promising results in the treatment of TRD. CASE PRESENTATION: Here, the case of a 43-year-old man with TRD is presented. TRD symptoms were greatly interfering with his life. He underwent psychological testing, lab work, adequate trials of numerous medications, transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and electroconvulsive therapy, all without adequate relief of his symptoms. The patient began self-administering a microdosing regimen of psilocybin and experienced significant improvement of MDD symptoms, as characterized by Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). DISCUSSION: In recent years, multiple randomized, controlled trials (RCTs) have shown the benefit of psilocybin in the treatment of varying types of depression. One trial evaluated psilocybin and escitalopram as treatments for depression, and psilocybin was found to be superior. CONCLUSION: This case suggests the possible benefit of psilocybin in the setting of TRD, as outlined in recent research. Additional research is needed to confirm these observations."

"4361","0","Data crowdsourcing on psychomotor and cognitive effects of cannabis via mobile app.^\nIn an effort to educate consumers of cannabis, we created a downloadable application (app) for mobile phones that collects data on the neuropsychological effects related to cannabis use. In particular, the app assessed four domains, these being: (i) psychomotor compensation, (ii) time estimation, (iii) sustained attention, and (iv) response inhibition. These tests were presented as a sequence of video games to be completed in under 10 min. Included in the analysis were 213 users who indicated that they were intoxicated from cannabis at the moment of app use. The control group contained individuals who reported using the app while sober (n = 137). A machine learning model was applied to the data to determine whether a particular pattern of performance was predictive of intoxication, and these results were used to inform the creation of a composite score that reflected aggregate performance for all four (i-iv) video games. Relative to the control group, the largest performance decrements were discovered within the initial 120 min after self-administration. These deficits abated as the time-since-use lengthened, and this pattern was consistent with the time-course of subjectively reported intoxication. Although significant limitations in interpretation exist due to the naturalistic and self-report data collection method, this proof-of-concept study points toward the potential utility of mobile app detection of cannabis effect.

"2871","0","The Montreal model: an integrative biomedical-psychedelic approach to ketamine for severe treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Subanesthetic ketamine has accumulated meta-analytic evidence for rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), resulting in both excitement and debate. Many unanswered questions surround ketamine's mechanisms of action and its integration into real-world psychiatric care, resulting in diverse utilizations that variously resemble electroconvulsive therapy, conventional antidepressants, or serotonergic psychedelics. There is thus an unmet need for clinical approaches to ketamine that are tailored to its unique therapeutic properties. METHODS: This article presents the Montreal model, a comprehensive biopsychosocial approach to ketamine for severe TRD refined over 6 years in public healthcare settings. To contextualize its development, we review the evidence for ketamine as a biomedical and as a psychedelic treatment of depression, emphasizing each perspectives' strengths, weaknesses, and distinct methods of utilization. We then describe the key clinical experiences and research findings that shaped the model's various components, which are presented in detail. RESULTS: The Montreal model, as implemented in a recent randomized clinical trial, aims to synergistically pair ketamine infusions with conventional and psychedelic biopsychosocial care. Ketamine is broadly conceptualized as a brief intervention that can produce windows of opportunity for enhanced psychiatric care, as well as powerful occasions for psychological growth. The model combines structured psychiatric care and concomitant psychotherapy with six ketamine infusions, administered with psychedelic-inspired nonpharmacological adjuncts including rolling preparative and integrative psychological support. DISCUSSION: Our integrative model aims to bridge the biomedical-psychedelic divide to offer a feasible, flexible, and standardized approach to ketamine for TRD. Our learnings from developing and implementing this psychedelic-inspired model for severe, real-world patients in two academic hospitals may offer valuable insights for the ongoing roll-out of a range of psychedelic therapies. Further research is needed to assess the Montreal model's effectiveness and hypothesized psychological mechanisms."

"8370","1","A qualitative and quantitative account of patient's experiences of ketamine and its antidepressant properties.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is central to one of the most rapidly growing areas of neuroscientific research into novel treatments for depression. Limited research has indicated that the psychedelic properties of ketamine may play a role in its antidepressant effects. AIM: The aim of the current study was to explore the psychedelic experiences and sustained impact of ketamine in major depressive disorder. METHODS: In the current study, ketamine (0.44 mg/kg) was administered to 32 volunteers with major depressive disorder in a crossover design with the active-placebo remifentanil, in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) environment. The 11-dimension altered states of consciousness questionnaire and individual qualitative interviews were used to capture the acute psychedelic experience. The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale and further interviewing explored lasting effects. The second qualitative interview took place ⩾3 weeks post-ketamine. RESULTS: Greater antidepressant response (reduction in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale at 24 h) correlated with the 11-dimension altered states of consciousness dimensions: spirituality, experience of unity, and insight. The first qualitative interview revealed that all participants experienced perceptual changes. Additional themes emerged including loss of control and emotional and mood changes. The final interview showed evidence of a psychedelic afterglow, and changes to perspective on life, people, and problems, as well as changes to how participants felt about their depression and treatments. CONCLUSIONS: The current study provides preliminary evidence for a role of the psychedelic experience and afterglow in ketamine's antidepressant properties. Reflexive thematic analysis provided a wealth of information on participants' experience of the study and demonstrated the psychedelic properties of ketamine are not fully captured by commonly used questionnaires."
"9456","0","Comparing the subjective, psychomotor and physiological effects of intravenous nalbuphine and morphine in healthy volunteers.^\nThe purposes of this study were to characterize the subjective, psychomotor and physiological effects of nalbuphine in healthy non-drug abusing volunteers and to compare and contrast the effects of equianalgesic doses of nalbuphine and morphine. Subjects (12 males, 4 females) without histories of opiate dependence were injected in an upper extremity vein with 0, 2.5, 5.0 or 10 mg/70 kg nalbuphine, or with 10 mg/70 kg morphine, using a randomized, double-blind, crossover design. The 10-mg doses of nalbuphine and morphine are considered equianalgesic and are doses commonly given for relief of postoperative pain. Subjective effects of nalbuphine included increased scores on the Pentobarbital-Chlorpromazine-Alcohol Group scale and the Lysergic Acid Diethylamide scale of the Addiction Research Center Inventory; increased adjective checklist ratings of ""nodding,"" ""numb"" and ""sweating""; increased visual analog scale ratings of ""coasting or spaced out,"" ""high"" and ""sleepy"" and increased ""feel drug effect"" and drug-liking ratings. Ten milligrams of nalbuphine had subjective effects similar, and similar in magnitude, to those of 10 mg of morphine. Nalbuphine produced exophoria and impairment on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test in a dose-related fashion. Ten milligrams of morphine produced exophoria but did not affect performance on the Digit Symbol Substitution Test. Both nalbuphine and morphine induced miosis and decreases in respiration rate. The results of the present study demonstrate that 2.5 to 10 mg nalbuphine had orderly, dose-related effects on subjective, psychomotor and physiological variables. The results also indicate that 10 mg of nalbuphine produces a profile of subjective, psychomotor and physiological effects similar to that of an equianalgesic dose of morphine (10 mg). The similarity in profiles between drugs at this dose is consistent with both infrahuman studies, which suggests that nalbuphine is a mu agonist, and studies with nondependent opioid abusers, in which relatively low doses of nalbuphine (such as 10 mg) produce morphine-like effects."
"4905","1","The potential role of lysergic acid diethylamide for psychological assisted therapy: A meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials in healthy volunteers.^\nOBJECTIVE: In recent years, interest in using lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in psychiatric research and corresponding therapy has increased rapidly. In this meta-analysis, we explored the effects of LSD on healthy subjects with respect to subjective drug effects, blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature and side effects. METHOD: PubMed, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched from January 2010 to December 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on the effects of LSD in healthy people. Subsequently, 5 RCTs with 132 healthy people which focused on the effects of LSD were enrolled in our study. RESULT: We found that taking 50, 100 and 200 mcg LSD doses were associated with a significant increase in the maximal difference from the baseline compared to the placebo group among the outcomes of AMRS (Adjective Mood Rating Scale) score. Significant differences existed between the LSD and placebo groups when taking 100 and 200 mcg LSD in acute adverse effects (100 mcg: SMD = .97, 95% confidence interval [CI], .50, 1.44, Z = 4.04, p < .001; 200 mcg: SMD = 1.18, 95% CI, 0.65, 1.72, Z = 4.32, p < .001). CONCLUSIONS: Meta-analysis of the subjective effects of LSD in healthy people revealed moderate significant effect sizes in favor of LSD with no significant adverse effects. A 100 mcg dose of LSD has potential for use in psychological-assisted therapy and may improve the mental fitness of patients with disease-related psychiatric distress. Additional clinical trials are necessary to explore the efficacy and safety of LSD as a psychological-assisted therapy."

The aim of the present study was to identify difficulties Brazilian medical students face regarding stressors, psychological distress, and psychiatric morbidity using standardized reliable and valid instruments. In addition, this study also investigated differences associated with sex. Students (n = 129) were asked to complete a one-off survey from January to June 2019, including demographics, previous mental health issues, CAGE, GHQ-12, and OLBI. A higher prevalence of previous mental disorders was found in comparison to during the medical course. This may suggest that perhaps students are under more stress or that they form a more vulnerable sub-population in medical school in comparison with the general population. However, the types of mental disorders before and during the undergraduate course appear to vary. During the course, they show higher levels of anxiety rather than that of depression. Before commencing the course, they showed higher levels of depression rather than anxiety. Cannabis and ecstasy experimentation levels were higher than those of students from other courses in previous studies. The opposite was true for stimulants. Just over a quarter reported alcohol abuse above the CAGE cut-off point. The levels of psychological distress and burnout were extremely high, and women had even higher levels. Male respondents were more likely to have a history of mental ill-health, but female subjects scored higher on burnout. Overall over 80% students reported burnout. These findings are discussed in the context of Brazilian culture."

In 177 cases of individuals suspected of driving under the influence of drugs, oral fluid was collected at the roadside and analyzed in parallel to serum samples. The study was performed to investigate the variability of oral fluid analysis results in relation to blood/serum. In 45% of the cases single-drug use was found, and in 50% poly-drug use was found. Cannabis was most prevalent (78%), and 70% of these individuals were also positive for tetrahydrocannabinol in serum. Overall, 97% of oral fluid samples positive for any substance were also positive in serum. Comparing data of oral fluid and serum for amphetamine, MDMA, morphine, benzoylecgonine, and tetrahydrocannabinol, the sensitivities were 100%, 97%, 87%, 87%, and 92%, respectively. Overall specificity and accuracy were in the range of 91-98%. Discrepancies between a negative oral fluid sample and a positive serum sample could be explained by analytical insensitivity in the lower volume of oral fluid analyzed (estimated for 0.1 mL confirmation vs. 1 mL of serum) or a shorter detection window in oral fluid. The low prevalence of discrepancies with positive oral fluid and negative serum results (2-9% of the cases) may be explained by persistent oral contamination especially for orally consumed drugs, like MDMA and cannabis. It is concluded that the detection of a psychoactive substance in oral fluid taken at the roadside is highly predictive for the detection of the corresponding drug or its metabolite in serum. Oral fluid testing is therefore suitable for the efficient confirmation of drug use of drivers suspected of being under the influence of drugs."
"7479","0","Chronic treatment with a serotonin2 receptor (5-HT2R) agonist modulates the behavioral and cellular response to (+)-3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine [(+)-MDMA].^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA; ecstasy] evokes a multifaceted subjective experience in human users which includes stimulation, feelings of well-being, mood elevation, empathy towards others as well as distortions in time, sensation and perception. Aspects of this unique psychopharmacology of MDMA are thought to be related to its potent actions to release serotonin (5-HT) and indirectly stimulate the 5-HT2A receptor (5-HT2AR). In the present studies, we examined the interrelationship between down-regulation of 5-HT2AR expression and the behaviorally stimulatory effects generated by acute administration of (+)-MDMA, the most potent enantiomer of (±)-MDMA. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were chronically treated with the preferential 5-HT2AR agonist 2,5-dimethoxy-4- iodoamphetamine (DOI) which has been shown to down-regulate expression of the 5-HT2AR, but not the closely related 5-HT2CR. While chronic DOI treatment did not alter the functional sensitivity of either the 5-HT2AR or 5-HT2CR, this regimen enhanced (+)-MDMA-evoked hyperactivity. Subsequent analysis of c-Fos and 5-HT2AR immunoreactivity in brain sections demonstrated that DOI treatment decreased the number of (+)-MDMA-induced c-Fos immunopositive nuclei and 5-HT2AR immunostaining in select cortical and striatal areas. These results indicate that chronic DOI exposure results in an enhanced behavioral response to (+)-MDMA and in a pattern of neuronal activation which resembles that seen in psychostimulant sensitization. These data also suggest that expression of the 5-HT2AR in the NAc and PFC may play a role in the sensitivity to the locomotor-stimulating effects of (+)-MDMA and in the processes of neural regulation upon repeated psychostimulant administration. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The aim of this study was to examine substance use at EDM events, focusing on associations between attendance motives and substance use. Sociodemographic characteristics, event specifics, past-year use, and attendance motives were assessed through an online survey. Participants were 1345 Belgian EDM event attendees (69.44% male, Mage = 22.63, SDage = 4.03). Ecstasy/MDMA/Molly (52.28%), other synthetic hallucinogens (53.68%), ketamine (42.13%), amphetamines (40.45%), and alkyl nitrites (poppers) (32.76%) were most frequently used at festivals/outdoor parties/raves. In nightclubs, cocaine (32.29%) was shown to be prevalent as well, while other synthetic hallucinogens (15.79%) were less often consumed. At events with a more private character, cannabis (68.88%) and magic mushrooms (66.44%) were most frequently used. Aside from alcohol (47.76%), substance use in pubs/bars was negligible. Overall enjoyment was demonstrated to be the key attendance motive, which was succeeded by those relating to music and socialization. A wide range of motives proved to be more important to users (e.g., dance, exploration, escapism, excitement, alcohol, drugs) than non-users, while some were associated with the use of particular substances. The prevalence of substance use was shown to be dependent on the specifics of the setting. Moreover, the idea of a three-dimensional classification of the most principal motives for music event attendance was supported. Finally, correlations were estimated between attendance motives and substance use as well as specific substances. Results could enable more tailored approaches in prevention and harm reduction efforts as well as event management strategies."
"2223","1","Acute psychomotor effects of MDMA and ethanol (co-) administration over time in healthy volunteers.^\nIn Western societies, a considerable percentage of young people use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or 'ecstasy'). The use of alcohol (ethanol) in combination with ecstasy is common. The aim of the present study was to assess the acute psychomotor and subjective effects of (co-) administration of MDMA and ethanol over time and in relation to the pharmacokinetics. We performed a four-way, double blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study in 16 healthy volunteers (nine men, seven women) between the ages of 18 and 29. MDMA (100 mg) was given orally while blood alcohol concentration was maintained at pseudo-steady state levels of approximately 0.6 per thousand for 3 h by a 10% intravenous ethanol clamp. MDMA significantly increased psychomotor speed but did not affect psychomotor accuracy and induced subjective arousal. Ethanol impaired both psychomotor speed and accuracy and induced sedation. Coadministration of ethanol and MDMA improved psychomotor speed but impaired psychomotor accuracy compared with placebo and reversed ethanol-induced sedation. Pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics showed maximal effects at 90-150 min after MDMA administration after which drug effects declined in spite of persisting MDMA plasma concentration, with the exception of ethanol-induced sedation, which manifested itself fully only after the infusion was stopped. In conclusion, results show that subjects were more aroused when intoxicated with both substances combined compared with placebo, but psychomotor accuracy was significantly impaired. These findings may have implications for general neuropsychological functioning as this may provide a sense of adequate performance that does not agree with a significant reduction in psychomotor accuracy."
"1894","0","Efficacy and tolerability of riluzole in psychiatric disorders: A systematic review and preliminary meta-analysis.^\nThere is a pressing need for better pharmacological treatment strategies for psychiatric disorders as current treatment often results in partial symptom remission and unwanted side effects. A point of entry may be the glutamatergic system since glutamatergic dysregulation contributes to multiple psychiatric disorders. We evaluated the evidence from randomized controlled trials (RCTs) regarding the use of the glutamatergic drug riluzole in mental illnesses; and conducted preliminary meta-analyses of its effectiveness in treating obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression. A systematic search was performed using PubMed (Medline), Embase, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews and PsycINFO. Meta-analyses were performed using Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software. Twenty-three RCTs were included for qualitative analysis and showed positive effects of adjunctive/monotherapy riluzole in patients with OCD, depression, autism, substance abuse and schizophrenia. Seven studies were also used for quantitative analysis, which revealed positive but non-significant effects on OCD and depression. Riluzole was generally well tolerated with few serious adverse events. The studies included in this systematic review were highly heterogeneous and the number of studies was limited per diagnostic condition. Moreover, few studies have examined riluzole as a single treatment. We suggest carrying out further work to provide definitive evidence for the benefit of riluzole in psychiatric illness."

A review of the evidence for esketamine (British Journal of Psychiatry (2020) (1–4) DOI: 10.1192/bjp.2020.89).^\nIt should be emphasised that Table 1 in the Analysis1 combines data from Phase 2 trials (including open-label and placebo-controlled trial periods) and Phase 3 trials (placebo-controlled efficacy studies, a maintenance of effect study and a long-term open label safety study) submitted by Janssen to the FDA (as indicated by superscript 'b' in the Table), therefore the data does not represent a randomised comparison, and definitive causal inferences cannot be drawn. As indicated by the denominators for each entry there were more patients exposed to esketamine than placebo (and for longer periods) which may be one reason for the higher numbers of suicides in the esketamine group. However, it is worth noting other data that suggest that increased suicidality may be a feature of esketamine treatment. In the long-term safety study 14.5% of patients on esketamine (in a population selected for their lack of active suicidality) reported 'treatment-emergent' suicidal ideation (114/784), 6 patients attempted suicide in addition to the one completed suicide.2 Furthermore, a recent analysis of post-marketing surveillance data reported to the FDA for the 12 months since esketamine was licensed in the US there have already been 64 reports of suicidal ideation, 11 completed suicides, and 6 attempted suicides attributed to esketamine.3 This represents a 24-fold increased risk of report for suicidal ideation for esketamine compared with other drugs, and a 6-fold increased risk for completed suicide.3 The authors of this paper concluded that the safety of esketamine required ""urgent clarification.""3 It should also be clarified that although ketamine is not used routinely as an anaesthetic agent in high-income countries, like the UK, because of its unfavourable balance of risks and harms, it is used more frequently in low-income countries."
"7580","1","Intramuscular ketamine vs. midazolam for rapid risk-reduction in suicidal, depressed emergency patients: Clinical trial design and rationale.^\nEmergency department (ED) visits for suicidal ideation or behavior have been increasing in all age groups, particularly younger adults. A rapid-acting treatment to reduce suicidal thinking, adapted for ED use, is needed. Previous studies have shown a single dose of ketamine can improve depression and suicidal ideation within hours. However, most studies used 40 min intravenous infusions which can be impractical in a psychiatric ED. The ER-Ketamine study we describe here is a randomized midazolam-controlled clinical trial (RCT; NCT04640636) testing intramuscular (IM) ketamine's feasibility, safety, and effectiveness to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation and depression in a psychiatric ED. A pre-injection phase involves screening, informed consent, eligibility confirmation, and baseline assessment of suicidal ideation, depression, and comorbidities. The randomized double-blind IM injection is administered in the ED under research staff supervision, vital sign monitoring, pharmacokinetic blood sampling, and clinical assessments. The post-injection phase occurs on a psychiatric inpatient unit with follow-up research assessments through four weeks post-discharge. Outcome measures are feasibility, safety, and effects on suicidal ideation and depression at 24 h post-injection, and through follow-up. The target sample is N = 90 adults in a major depressive episode, assessed by ED clinicians as warranting hospitalization for suicide risk. Here we report design, rationale, and preliminary feasibility and safety for this ongoing study. Demographics of the 53 participants (ages 18 to 65 years) randomized to date suggest a diverse sample tending towards younger adults."

"6708","0","The psychotherapeutic potential of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) : An evidence-based review.^\nAims and rationale: The purpose of this study was to review whether methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has the appropriate pharmacodynamic profile to be a therapeutic agent. Materials and methods: Empirical descriptions of MDMA's subjective effects in humans will be reviewed to evaluate the proposal that MDMA has psychotherapeutic properties. The focus will be published evidence on its functional effects in therapeutic, medical, and other situations. Results: MDMA is a powerful central nervous system (CNS) stimulant which affects several neurotransmitter systems and intensifies a range of psychobiological functions. Its acute mood effects can be very positive and life enhancing, and the affirmative cognitions engendered during MDMA therapy may well endure afterwards. However, MDMA also has a number of potential anti-therapeutic characteristics. Acutely, it can also intensify negative cognitions, and these may similarly endure over time. Psychotherapists have found that setting, intention, and expectancy are crucial for a positive outcome, but these factors cannot be guaranteed. Post-MDMA, there is a period of neurotransmitter recovery when low moods predominate, and these may exacerbate psychiatric distress. The explanations proposed for MDMA-assisted therapy are all psychodynamic, and a neurochemical model needs to be outlined. It has been suggested that enduring therapeutic gains can follow a single session, but again, this lacks a clear psychopharmacological rationale. Finally, diathesis-stress models suggest that psychiatric individuals are more prone to acute and chronic abreactions to CNS stimulants such as MDMA. Conclusions: There are a number of issues which need to be addressed before it can be argued that MDMA might be clinically useful for psychotherapy. © 2007 Springer-Verlag."

Whether MDMA is neurotoxic in humans has not been established. Thirty MDMA users and 28 controls were admitted to a controlled inpatient setting for measurement of biologic and behavioral indexes of central 5-HT function. Outcome measures obtained after at least 2 weeks of drug abstinence included concentrations of monoamine metabolites in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), prolactin responses to L-tryptophan, nociceptive responses to ischemic pain, and personality characteristics in which 5-HT has been implicated (i.e., impulsivity and aggression). Subjects with a history of MDMA exposure had lower levels of CSF 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (the major metabolite of 5-HT) than controls (p = .001). Although they resembled controls in their prolactin response to L-tryptophan and their response to ischemic pain, MDMA users had lower scores on personality measures of impulsivity (p = .004) and indirect hostility (p = .009). The CSF findings suggest that 5-HT neurotoxicity may be a potential complication of MDMA use. Further, differences in personality support the view that 5-HT systems are involved in modulating impulsive and aggressive personality traits. Additional studies of MDMA-exposed individuals are needed to confirm and extend the present findings. Such studies could help elucidate the role of 5-HT in normal brain function as well as in neuropsychiatric disease states."
"5695","1","MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD: study design and rationale for phase 3 trials based on pooled analysis of six phase 2 randomized controlled trials.^\nBACKGROUND: Posttraumatic stress disorder is a prevalent mental health condition with substantial impact on daily functioning that lacks sufficient treatment options. Here we evaluate six phase 2 trials in a pooled analysis to determine the study design for phase 3 trials of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD. METHODS: Six randomized, double-blind, controlled clinical trials at five study sites were conducted from April 2004 to February 2017. Active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg, n = 72) or placebo/control doses (0-40 mg, n = 31) were administered to individuals with PTSD during manualized psychotherapy sessions in two or three 8-h sessions spaced a month apart. Three non-drug 90-min therapy sessions preceded the first MDMA exposure, and three to four followed each experimental session. RESULTS: After two blinded experimental sessions, the active group had significantly greater reductions in CAPS-IV total scores from baseline than the control group [MMRM estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 22.0 (5.17), P < 0.001]. The between-group Cohen's d effect size was 0.8, indicating a large treatment effect. After two experimental sessions, more participants in the active group (54.2%) did not meet CAPS-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria than the control group (22.6%). Depression symptom improvement on the BDI-II was greatest for the active group compared to the control group, although only trended towards significant group differences [MMRM, estimated mean difference (SE) between groups - 6.0 (3.03), P = 0.053]. All doses of MDMA were well tolerated, with some expected reactions occurring at greater frequency for the active MDMA group during experimental sessions and the 7 days following. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA-assisted psychotherapy was efficacious and well tolerated in a large sample of adults with PTSD. These studies supported expansion into phase 3 trials and led to FDA granting Breakthrough Therapy designation for this promising treatment.

"9106","0","Early Warning System for Illicit Drug Use at Large Public Events: Trace Residue Analysis of Discarded Drug Packaging Samples.^\nInspired by Locard's exchange principle, which states ""every contact leaves a trace"", a trace residue sampling strategy has been developed for the analysis of discarded drug packaging samples (DPS), as part of an early warning system for illicit drug use at large public events including music/dance festivals. Using direct analysis in real time/mass spectrometry and tandem mass spectrometry, rapid and high-throughput identification and characterization of a wide range of illicit drugs and adulterant substances was achieved, including in complex polydrug mixtures and at low relative ion abundances. A total of 1362 DPS were analyzed either off-site using laboratory-based instrumentation or on-site and in close to real time using a transportable mass spectrometer housed within a mobile analytical laboratory, with each analysis requiring less than 1 min per sample. Of the DPS analyzed, 92.2% yielded positive results for at least one of 15 different drugs and/or adulterants, including cocaine, MDMA, and ketamine, as well as numerous novel psychoactive substances (NPS). Also, 52.6% of positive DPS were found to contain polydrug mixtures, and a total of 42 different drug and polydrug combinations were observed throughout the study. For analyses performed on-site, reports to key stakeholders including event organizers, first aid and medical personnel, and peer-based harm reduction workers could be provided in as little as 5 min after sample collection. Following risk assessment of the potential harms associated with their use, drug advisories or alerts were then disseminated to event staff and patrons and subsequently to the general public when substances with particularly toxic properties were identified."

This systematic review and meta-analysis is the first to estimate the rank and consumption rate of illicit drugs through WBE studies. In the current study, the related investigations regarding the illicit drug consumption rate based on WBE were searched among the international databases including Scopus, PubMed, Science direct, Google scholar, and local database, Magiran from 2012 up to May 2019. The illicit drug consumption rate with 95% confidence intervals was pooled between studies by using random effect model. The heterogeneity was determined using I(2) statistics. Also, subgroup analyses were conducted to examine the possible effects of year and location of studies on observed heterogeneity. Meta-analysis of 37 articles indicates that the overall rank order of illicit drugs according to their pooled consumption rate can be summarized as tetrahydrocannabinol or cannabis (7417.9 mg/day/1000 people) > cocaine (655.7 mg/day/1000 people) > morphine (384.9 mg/day/1000 people) > methamphetamine (296.2 mg/day/1000 people) > codeine (222.7 mg/day/1000 people) > methadone (200.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (126.3 mg/day/1000 people) > amphetamine (118.2 mg/day/1000 people) > 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (33.7 mg/day/1000 people). The pooled level rate was 190.16 mg/day/1000 people for benzoylecgonine (main urinary cocaine metabolite), 137.9 mg/day/1000 people for 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (main metabolite of cannabis), and 33.7 mg/day/1000 people for 2-ethylidene-1,5-dimethyl-3, 3-diphenylpyrrolidine (main metabolite of methadone). The I(2) values for all selected drugs were 100% (P value < 0.001). The results of year subgroup indicated that the changes of heterogeneity for all selected drugs were nearly negligible. The heterogeneity within studies based on continents subgroup just decreased in America for drugs like 11-nor-9-carboxy-delta9-tetrahydrocannabinol (I(2) = 24.4%) and benzoylecgonine (I(2) = 94.1%).

"8829","1","Heritability of lifetime ecstasy use.^\nBackground Ecstasy is a widely used psychoactive drug that users often take because they experience positive effects such as increased euphoria, sociability, elevated mood, and heightened sensations. Ecstasy use is not harmless and several immediate and long term side effects have been identified. Lifetime ecstasy use is likely to be partly influenced by genetic factors, but no twin study has determined the heritability. Here, we apply a classical twin design to a large sample of twins and siblings to estimate the heritability of lifetime ecstasy use. Methods The sample comprised 8500 twins and siblings aged between 18 and 45 years from 5402 families registered at the Netherlands Twin Registry. In 2013–2014 participants filled out a questionnaire including a question whether they had ever used ecstasy. We used the classical twin design to partition the individual differences in liability to ecstasy use into that due to genetic, shared environmental, and residual components. Results Overall, 10.4% of the sample had used ecstasy during their lifetime, with a somewhat higher prevalence in males than females. Twin modelling indicated that individual differences in liability to lifetime ecstasy use are for 74% due to genetic differences between individuals, whereas shared environmental and residual factors explain a small proportion of its liability (5% and 21%, respectively). Although heritability estimates appeared to be higher for females than males, this difference was not significant. Conclusions Lifetime ecstasy use is a highly heritable trait, which indicates that some people are genetically more vulnerable to start using ecstasy than others."
"5571","0","Classic and non‐classic psychedelics for substance use disorder: A review of their historic, past and current research.^\nSubstance use disorder (SUD) is a global public health concern that affects millions of people worldwide. Considering current research, addiction has been noted as the last stage of a chronic disease that may impair brain reward circuit responses and affects personal and social life. Treatments for SUD face challenges including availability and limited pharmacological response, often resulting in low retention of patients. A growing number of studies from the ‘psychedelic renaissance’ have highlighted the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for several psychiatric disorders, including SUD. In this non-systematic review we discuss past and current clinical and observational studies with classic (LSD, DMT, psilocybin and mescaline) and non-classic (ibogaine, ketamine, MDMA, salvinorin A and THC) psychedelics for the treatment of SUD published until December 2021. Although results are still inconclusive for LSD, DMT, mescaline, MDMA and Salvinorin A, in general, the literature presents moderate evidence on the controlled use of psilocybin and ketamine for Alcohol Use Disorder, ketamine for management of opiate and alcohol withdrawal, and THC preparations for reducing withdrawal symptoms in Cannabis and possibly in Opioid Use Disorder. Importantly, studies suggest that psychedelics should be more effective when employed as an adjunct therapy.

"7357","1","Perception of heading in abstinent MDMA and THC users.^\nPurpose: Assess residual effects of MDMA (Ecstasy) and THC (marijuana) on perceived trajectory of travel. Methods: 42 licensed drivers (ages 21-42) participated: 12 MDMA/THC users, 15 THC users and 15 non-drug users. Drug use besides MDMA/THC was similar in both drug groups. There were no age, acuity (Sloane) or contrast sensitivity (Pelli-Robson) differences between groups. Perception of self-motion, or heading, from optical flow patterns was tested with stimuli comprising random dot ground planes presented at 3 densities (.035, .243 and .451 dots/ square degree) and 8 heading angles (1,2, 4 and 8 deg to the left or right). On each trial, subjects reported if direction of travel was to the left or the right relative to a vertical post whose position varied with respect to body midline (Warren et al., 1989). Right and left heading angles were combined into one score, as we expected no lateralized performance difference. Dependent measure was % correct. Results: Performance in all groups improved as heading angle increased; density had little effect. Plots of % correct vs. degrees of heading angle showed worse performance in both drug groups compared to controls at all but the 8 deg heading angle (P<0.05). The MDMA/THC group performed worst, especially at lower heading angles. Conclusions: Psychoactive agents appear to adversely affect visual perception, even in recently abstinent users, and appear to be additive in MDMA and THC. Precise mechanisms are unknown, but may involve serotonin and acetylcholine receptors in visual pathways. Residual effects may impair performance on driving-related tasks."
"1335","1","Development and validation of a nonisotopic immunoassay for the detection of LSD in human urine.^\nA microplate enzyme immunoassay (EIA) for the detection of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in human urine was developed. The assay kit is designed around an LSD derivative coated on the wall of microplate wells with preservatives and stabilizers. Sample and rabbit anti-LSD are added to the microplate well. The immobilized LSD and LSD present in specimens compete for the opportunity to bind to the anti-LSD antibodies. An anti-rabbit antibody labeled with horseradish peroxidase is used to provide the assay signal, which is inversely proportional to the concentration of LSD in the sample. The assay requires a 25-μL urine sample and three consecutive incubation periods of 60, 30, and 30 min at room temperature. The assay was tested with a variety of drugs, including ergot alkaloids spiked into drug-free urine at up to 100,000 ng/mL without cross-reaction. Nor-LSD was shown to cross-react between 16% and 28%, depending on its concentration. Of the other compounds tested, only ergonovine demonstrated slight cross-reactivity at approximately 0.0008%. The assay is designed to be used with a qualitative cutoff of 0.5 ng/mL. Precision testing at 0.5 ng/mL gave a coefficient of variation (CV) of 6% based on 20 replicates. The CV at 0.375 ng/mL (cutoff, -25%) was 5.2% and at 0.625 ng/mL was 6.6%. Precision at other concentrations within the range of the calibration curve gave similar results both intra- and interassay. Clinical performance of the assay was compared with that of a commercial radioimmunoassay (RIA). Comparable performance was observed with both methods, each screening a total of 458 samples as negative and 17 samples as positive relative to a 0.5 ng/mL cutoff. The EIA found an additional three positive samples that were negative by RIA. The EIA is suitable for the screening of urine samples for the presence of LSD. Preliminary indications are that the assay is also suitable for use with whole blood specimens. The assay can be performed manually or be fully automated and without the need for radioactivity; it can be used in any laboratory."
"5229","0","Peak experiences and the afterglow phenomenon: When and how do therapeutic effects of hallucinogens depend on psychedelic experiences?.^\nInterest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic substances has recently resumed. During an early phase of human psychedelic research, their therapeutic application in different pathologies had been suggested, and the first evidence for efficacy was provided. The range of recent clinical applications of psychedelics spans from cluster headaches and obsessive-compulsive disorder to addiction and the treatment of fear and anxiety in patients suffering from terminal illness, indicating potentially different therapeutic mechanisms. A variety of approaches in psychotherapy emphasize subjective experiences, such as so-called peak experiences or afterglow phenomena, as differentially mediating therapeutic action. This review aims to re-evaluate earlier and recent concepts of how psychedelic substances may exert beneficial effects. After a short outline of neurophenomenological aspects, we discuss different approaches to how psychedelics are used in psychotherapy. Finally, we summarize evidence for the relationship between subjective experiences and therapeutic success. While the distinction between pharmacological and psychological action obviously cannot be clear-cut, they do appear to contribute differently from each other when their effects are compared with regard to pathologies."

Although there is a lack of scientific consensus concerning the long-term consequences of Ecstasy use, reducing potential morbidity and mortality is an important public health concern. This article describes how young people characterise perceived long-term consequences associated with Ecstasy using three data sources: (1) qualitative interviews with 29 participants; (2) pile sort results from 20 participants who classified 15 psychoactive substances on the basis of perceived similarities; and (3) quantitative data on subjective memory impairment from 402 participants in our natural history study. Contrary to expectations, Ecstasy was classified midway between drugs perceived to be the most and least risky. Risks associated with Ecstasy use included two popular myths implying forms of brain damage - ""draining spinal fluid"" and ""creating holes in brains"". Qualitative results also indicated that some young people are concerned about the potential affects of the drug on memory and as a cause of depression. About 20% (82) of the participants (n=402) ""agreed"" or ""strongly agreed"" that Ecstasy has impaired their memories. Concern about these adverse consequences may provide opportunities for reducing potential harm associated with Ecstasy use. © 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved."
"6879","1","Microdosing as a Response to the Meaning Crisis: A Qualitative Analysis.^\nThe use of psychedelic substances in both humanistic and mainstream clinical research has been increasing in the last decade. In particular, the practice of microdosing-ingesting sub-hallucinogenic doses of psychedelics-has been increasing in popularity, but large-scale qualitative analyses are still uncommon. This study attempted to recognize emergent themes in qualitative reports regarding the experience of microdosing to enrich the theoretical landscape in psychedelic research and propose future research directions for both basic and clinical research. Participants were people who reported microdosing at least once in the last year; they described their experiences using an online survey. Data from 118 informative responses suggested four main emergent themes: reasons for microdosing, the practice of microdosing itself, outcomes linked to microdosing, and meta-commentary about microdosing. We use meaning-making theory and propose that, even at low doses, psychedelic substances can provide a sense of meaning. Our results suggest that many of the reported benefits occur regardless of motivation to microdose and are likely due to the enhanced psychological flexibility and a sense of connectedness made possible due to the use of psychedelics. Double-blind, placebo-controlled experiments are required to substantiate these reports."
"7588","1","Toward a typology of hallucinogen users in the United States.^\nBackground: Roughly one in ten American adults have used hallucinogens, and emerging evidence suggests that the prevalence of use is increasing. However, our understanding of the degree to which individuals “specialize” in the use of a particular hallucinogen or are poly-hallucinogen users remains incomplete. Methods: This study examined data from 6381 individuals reporting past-year hallucinogen use in the 2016–2018 National Survey on Drug Use and Health. Logistic regression examined the association between the number of distinct hallucinogens used and psychosocial/behavioral risks, and latent class analysis (LCA) characterized subgroups of hallucinogen users. Results: The vast majority of hallucinogen users, roughly 70%, are not “specialists” who use only one hallucinogen type; rather, lifetime poly-hallucinogen use is the norm. Critically, however, we also see that important differences exist within the population of hallucinogen users—half (51%) could be classified as LSD-Mushroom-Ecstasy users only (this group was disproportionally comprised of youth), nearly one third (30%) were Poly-Hallucinogen users (this group was disproportionately male and non-Hispanic White), and smaller proportions were limited primarily to use of LSD-Mushrooms (6%; these individuals were almost exclusively ages 35 and older) or Ecstasy Only (12%; these individuals were mostly younger adults ages 18–34). Conclusions: Findings provide a fresh contribution to our understanding of poly-hallucinogen use in a time in which local and state governmental leaders, and people across the country, weigh the benefits and drawbacks of legalizing specific hallucinogenic drugs."
"9299","1","The variety of ecstasy/mdma users: Results from the national epidemiologic survey on alcohol and related conditions.^\nThis study investigates the potential heterogeneity of ecstasy or MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine) users. Data came from the 20012002 National Epidemiologic Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (NESARC). Latent class analysis (LCA) and multinomial logistic regression procedures were used to identify subtypes of ecstasy users. Approximately 1.6 (n = 562) of adult participants (N = 43,093) reported lifetime ecstasy use. LCA identified three subtypes of ecstasy users. Class 1 exhibited pervasive use of most drug classes (ecstasypolydrug users, 37). Class 2 reported a high rate of use of marijuana and cocaine and a moderate use of amphetamines (ecstasymarijuanastimulant users, 29). Class 3 was characterized by a high rate of use of marijuana and a low use of primarily prescription-type drugs (ecstasymarijuana users, 34). Subtypes were distinguished by family income, history of substance abuse treatment, and familial substance abuse. Class 1 exhibited the highest prevalence of disorders related to the use of marijuana (77%), tobacco (66%), amphetamines (36%), opioids (35%), sedatives (31%), and tranquilizers (30%). The recent resurgence in ecstasy use among adults underscores the need to monitor trends in its use. © 2009 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."
"7303","0","MDMA-Based Psychotherapy in Treatment-Resistant Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD): A Brief Narrative Overview of Current Evidence.^\nPost-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a debilitating mental health disorder that causes significant dysfunction in individuals. Currently, there are many approved pharmacotherapy and psychotherapy treatment options for PTSD, but unfortunately, half of the patients do not respond to traditional therapies. In this article, we review clinical trials and research on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy in PTSD patients, its pharmacokinetics, and current treatment guidelines for PTSD. Our findings are based on the results of the efficacy of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy from six phase II randomized controlled trials. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for PTSD has received the ""breakthrough therapy"" designation from the FDA. MDMA can reduce PTSD symptoms even in treatment-resistant cases by increasing certain neurohormones, i.e., dopamine, serotonin, norepinephrine, and oxytocin. It also modulates activities in the brain regions involved in fear and anxiety. Future research is needed to show whether the advantages outweigh the disadvantages and whether its use can be integrated into available treatment options for PTSD."

"7398","1","A simplified 6-Item clinician administered dissociative symptom scale (CADSS-6) for monitoring dissociative effects of sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions.^\nBACKGROUND: Dissociation is a treatment-emergent adverse event commonly associated with IV ketamine, often measured using the 23-item Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). The objective of this study was to develop a short form version of the CADSS for easier clinical use. METHODS: Retrospective data of 260 patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) receiving IV ketamine were randomly divided into two datasets. The first dataset (n = 130) was leveraged to develop a brief 6-item version of the CADSS (CADSS-6) based on items most sensitive to ketamine-induced dissociation. The CADSS-6 questions were then applied to the second dataset (n = 130) and the Spearman's correlation between the full-length CADSS and the CADSS-6 were assessed. RESULTS: The CADSS-6 was developed from questions 1, 2, 6, 7, 15, and 22 from the full length CADSS. There was a strong significant correlation between the CADSS-6 total score and the CADSS total score at infusions 1 (rs(106) = 0.92, p < 0.001), 2 (rs(100) = 0.91, p < 0.001), 3(rs(99) = 0.95, p < 0.001) and 4 (rs(102) = 0.94, p < 0.001). LIMITATIONS: The CADSS-6 was developed using a retrospective data; therefore, the scale remains unvalidated in this population. CONCLUSIONS: The CADSS-6 presented herein was sensitive to dissociation experienced by patients receiving IV ketamine. Overall, the CADSS-6 was strongly correlated at each infusion with the full-length CADSS. While future studies should look to validate the CADSS-6 in a TRD sample, this scale offers clinicians a brief assessment that can be used to characterize symptoms of dissociation."
"5430","0","Engagement in Chemsex among Men Who Have Sex with Men (MSM) in Malaysia: Prevalence and Associated Factors from an Online National Survey.^\nBackground: Chemsex is the use of illicit drugs—particularly methamphetamine, gamma hydroxybutyrate (GHB), and gamma-butyrolactone (GBL)—to enhance sexual activity. Chemsex, which occurs primarily among communities of men who have sex with men (MSM), is associated with greater HIV risk behaviors, including multiple sex partners, group sex, condomless sex, and injection drug use. Despite evidence showing chemsex engagement among Malaysian MSM, there is a paucity of research on chemsex among MSM in Malaysia. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted through an online survey (August to September 2021) among 870 Malaysian MSM. Participants were recruited through targeted advertisements on social networks. We collected information regarding participants’ recent (<6 months) engagement in chemsex, demographic characteristics, psychosocial factors, pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) knowledge and history, and recent sexual- and drug-related behavior. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with recent (<6 months) chemsex engagement. Results: Just under 1 in 10 (9.0%) of participants reported having engaged in chemsex in the previous six months. More than two-thirds of participants (69.1%) had not disclosed their sexual orientation to anyone in their family and 35.2% reported moderate to severe depressive symptoms. Multivariable analysis found that recent injection drug use (adjusted odds ratio: aOR = 6.61; 95% confidence interval: CI, 2.30–19.03), having shared pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with someone else (aOR = 5.60; 95% CI, 1.76–17.77), higher perceived HIV risk (aOR = 3.15; 95% CI, 1.25–7.93), knowing someone using PrEP (aOR = 2.93; 95% CI, 1.62–5.31), recent engagement in transactional sex (aOR = 2.38; 95% CI, 1.06–5.39), having a recent STI diagnosis (aOR = 2.36; 95% CI, 1.25–4.44), recent engagement in anal sex (aOR = 2.21; 95% CI, 1.07–4.57), and recent sexual intercourse with an HIV-positive partner (aOR = 2.09; 95% CI, 1.07–4.08) were associated with recent engagement in chemsex. Conclusions: Malaysian MSM who practice chemsex are vulnerable to several HIV risk factors, such as transactional sex, HIV-positive sexual partners, and injection drug use. There is an urgent need for programs that integrate drug, sexual health, and mental health services, with a focus on harm reduction (e.g., condoms, access to and utilization of HIV testing and PrEP services, drug knowledge, and safer drug use) tailored for MSM who practice chemsex."
"3096","1","Impaired cognitive performance in drug free users of recreational ecstasy (MDMA).^\nOBJECTIVES: Ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and related congerers: MDA, MDEA) is the name given to a group of popular recreational drugs. Animal data raise concern about neurotoxic effects of high doses of ecstasy on central serotonergic systems. The threshold dose for neurotoxicity in humans is not clear and serotonin is involved in several functions including cognition. The purpose of this study was to investigate cognitive performance in a group of typical recreational ecstasy users. METHODS: A comprehensive cognitive test battery was administered to 28 abstinent ecstasy users with concomitant use of cannabis only and to two equally sized matched groups of cannabis users and non-users. The sample consisted of ecstasy users with a typical recreational use pattern and did not include very heavy users. RESULTS: Ecstasy users were unimpaired in simple tests of attention (alertness). However, they performed worse than one or both control groups in the more complex tests of attention, in memory and learning tasks, and in tasks reflecting aspects of general intelligence. Heavier ecstasy and heavier cannabis use were associated with poorer performance in the group of ecstasy users. By contrast, the cannabis users did not differ significantly in their performance from the non-users. CONCLUSIONS: The present data raise concern that use of ecstasy possibly in conjunction with cannabis may lead to cognitive decline in otherwise healthy young people. Although the nature of the emerging cognitive disturbance is not yet clear, an impairment of working memory might be the common denominator underlying or contributing to declines of performance in various tasks. The cognitive disturbance is likely to be related to the well recognised neurotoxic potential of ecstasy. The data suggest that even typical recreational doses of ecstasy are sufficient to cause neurotoxicity in humans."
"6978","1","Effect of Psilocybin on Empathy and Moral Decision-Making.^\nBACKGROUND: Impaired empathic abilities lead to severe negative social consequences and influence the development and treatment of several psychiatric disorders. Furthermore, empathy has been shown to play a crucial role in moral and prosocial behavior. Although the serotonin system has been implicated in modulating empathy and moral behavior, the relative contribution of the various serotonin receptor subtypes is still unknown. METHODS: We investigated the acute effect of psilocybin (0.215 mg/kg p.o.) in healthy human subjects on different facets of empathy and hypothetical moral decision-making using the multifaceted empathy test (n=32) and the moral dilemma task (n=24). RESULTS: Psilocybin significantly increased emotional, but not cognitive empathy compared with placebo, and the increase in implicit emotional empathy was significantly associated with psilocybin-induced changed meaning of percepts. In contrast, moral decision-making remained unaffected by psilocybin. CONCLUSIONS: These findings provide first evidence that psilocybin has distinct effects on social cognition by enhancing emotional empathy but not moral behavior. Furthermore, together with previous findings, psilocybin appears to promote emotional empathy presumably via activation of serotonin 2A/1A receptors, suggesting that targeting serotonin 2A/1A receptors has implications for potential treatment of dysfunctional social cognition."
"2139","0","Serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics could be promising treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer.^\nIn a recent issue of the BMC Psychiatry, the evidence of effectiveness of treatments for psychiatric conditions in end-stage cancer patients was reviewed (Johnson, 2018). The review was comprehensive, and included traditional and non-traditional/alternative treatments, including herbal medicines and spirituality. However, evidence showing that classic or serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics such as psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) could be effective treatments for depressive and anxiety disorders in end-stage cancer was not included. In this commentary, we expand the information available on the original article by briefly reviewing data from recent placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over clinical trials showing evidence that administration of single (or few) doses of LSD and psilocybin was associated with rapid and sustained reductions in depressive and anxiety symptoms in patients with end-stage cancer and other life-threatening diseases (e.g., Bechterew's disease, Parkinson's disease, Celiac disease). Since these substances seem to produce rapid and sustained therapeutic effects with single (or few) doses and well tolerated, large-scale, prospective, multi-site studies of end-stage cancer and classical/serotonergic hallucinogens/psychedelics should be performed to improve our understanding of the therapeutic potentials of these drugs and their use on clinical practice."
"3121","1","Developing a Direct Observation Measure of Therapeutic Connection in Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy: A Feasibility Study.^\nContext: Measuring therapeutic connection during psilocybin-assisted therapy is essential to understand underlying mechanisms, inform training, and guide quality improvement. Purpose: To evaluate the feasibility of directly observing indicators of therapeutic connection during psilocybin administration encounters. Methods: We evaluated audio and video data from a recent clinical trial for observable expressions of therapeutic connection as defined in proposed best-practice competencies (i.e., empathic abiding presence and interpersonal grounding). We selected the first four 8-hour encounters involving unique participants, therapists, and gender pairs. Each video was independently coded by three members of an interprofessional six-person team. Using a structured checklist, coders recorded start-stop times, the audible (i.e., speech prosody or words) and visible (i.e., body movements, eye gaze, and touch) cues marking the event, and the qualities of the interaction (e.g., expression of awe, trust, distress, and calmness). We assessed feasibility by observing the frequency, distribution, and overlap of cues and qualities coders used to identify and define moments of therapeutic connection. Results: Among the 2074 minutes of video, coders recorded 372 moments of therapeutic connection. Eighty-three percent were identified by at least two coders and 41% by all three. Coders used a combination of audible and visual cues to identify therapeutic connection in 51% of observed events (190/372). Both the cues and qualities of therapeutic connection expressions varied over the course of psilocybin temporal effects on states of consciousness. Conclusion: Direct observation of therapeutic human connection is feasible, sensitive to changes in states of consciousness and requires evaluation of audible and visual data."
"7708","1","Crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy differ in relation to unsafe sex among young gay men.^\nObjective: Poly-substance use in gay social ('club') settings is common. Recent studies suggest a link between 'club' drug use and sexual risk behaviours. In this qualitative study, we compare and contrast two 'club' drugs: crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy (MDMA). Methods: Life history interviews were conducted with 12 HIV seroconverters and 12 age-matched controls recruited from a prospective cohort study of young gay and bisexual men in Vancouver, British Columbia. Textual data concerning illicit substance use and unsafe sex were analyzed using NUDIST software. Results: Most men related a substantial knowledge of and experience with crystal and ecstasy. Both drugs had attributes that enhanced gay socialization and were used in the same venues. Crystal was used to remain awake and increase energy. Ecstasy was used to induce euphoria and group connectedness. However, unlike ecstasy, crystal was associated with a distinct pattern of sexual arousal that frequently included unprotected (sometimes group) sex, was more likely to be used regularly by HIV-positive men, and was reportedly highly addictive and problematic. Conclusion: Crystal and ecstasy are used in the same social venues but differ markedly in relation to sexual risk behaviour."
"9244","1","Ketamine-induced changes in plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels are associated with the resting-state functional connectivity of the prefrontal cortex.^\nOBJECTIVES: Synaptic plasticity and brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) signalling are proposed to play key roles in antidepressant drug action. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist and putative antidepressant, may increase synaptic plasticity in prefrontal cortex through higher expression of BDNF. Furthermore, ketamine was shown to change resting-state functional connectivity (RSFC) of dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC). METHODS: In a randomised, placebo-controlled study, we investigated acutely (100 min) and at 24 h following subanesthetic ketamine infusion which dmPFC seeded RSFC changes are most strongly associated with plasma BDNF level changes in 53 healthy participants (21 females, age: 24.4 ± 2.9 years) using 7 T-fMRI. RESULTS: We observed higher relative levels of BDNF 2 h and 24 h after ketamine compared to placebo. Whole-brain regression revealed that the change in BDNF after 24 h was associated with RSFC decreases from dmPFC to posterior cingulate cortex and ventromedial PFC at 24 h and exploratively also at the 100 min measurement point. Follow-up analyses revealed that RSFC reductions following ketamine were restricted to subjects showing increased BDNF levels at 24 h. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings indicate BDNF level dynamics following ketamine are related to acute and 24 h RSFC changes. Particularly when BDNF increases are observed after ketamine infusion, a disconnection from dmPFC after 24 h is seen and may reflect synaptic plasticity effects."

"4882","0","Is MDD the right target for early-stage psychedelic-assisted therapy trials?.^\nThe recently published Imperial College study of a Phase II, double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing psilocybin-assisted therapy to a six-week titration of escitalopram for Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) should raise concerns for this illness category as a target of early psychedelic research given a goal of FDA approval. There are three reasons why MDD is the wrong target at this stage of research development. Firstly, the psychiatric category of MDD is heterogeneous, vaguely-defined, and overdiagnosed in a way that will problematize finding a reliable signal with psychedelic interventions (or any intervention), particularly within non-severe cases. Secondly, current rating scales for MDD (QIDS used in the Imperial College trial, but also HAM-D) are limited in approximating the kinds of things we ultimately care most about with depressive states, namely functional status, quality of life, and well-being: measures that seem more salient for psychedelic interventions and which are not adequately captured by these rating scales used in a majority of clinical trials. And thirdly, there are inherent conflicts between psychiatric conceptualizations of MDD (and its symptom amelioration) and the kinds of perspectives on one’s suffering often occasioned by psychedelic experiences themselves: while these kinds of psychedelic-catalyzed openings may lead to a form of acceptance or equanimity with regards to one’s life circumstances this could be in many ways orthogonal to reductions in HAM-D scores. We argue that for these reasons MDD is a non-ideal target at this stage of the science and propose alternative directions. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7744","1","Effects of methylphenidate and MDMA (ecstasy) on appraisal of erotic stimuli.^\nBackground: Methylphenidate is a stimulant drug used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it is also increasingly misused recreationally and as cognitive enhancer (neuroenhancer). 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') is a popular recreational club drug mainly used due to its entactogenic properties, i.e. the drug is thought to enhance feelings of sociability, empathy, and closeness to others. Methylphenidate mainly enhances dopaminergic neurotransmission, whereas MDMA mainly increases brain serotonin levels. Additionally, both drugs increase noradrenergic neurotransmission and therefore have also psychostimulant properties. It is well recognized that psychoactive substances affect sexual perception and behavior. Typically, dopaminergic psychostimulants including methamphetamine and cocaine are reported to enhance sexual drive and to increase sexual pleasure. In contrast, serotonergic drugs such as serotonin uptake inhibitors typically impair sexual arousal and functions (decreased libido, erectile dysfunction, difficulty reaching orgasm). However, ecstasy users describe inconsistent effects on sexual desire and performance. Some users report feelings of emotional closeness while consuming Ecstasy but no desire for penetrative sex. Others report that ecstasy increased their sexual arousal and some use it specifically for sexual enhancement. It seems that MDMA induces well‐being and feelings of closeness to others accompanied by a sensual rather than a sexual enhancement. However, research on psychoactive drug use and sexual behavior is typically based on interviews of drug users and has mainly focused on sexual risk taking. It remains to be determined, whether methylphenidate and MDMA alter sexual arousal when measured objectively in a laboratory setting. Objective: The aim of this study was to assess sexual arousal induced by visual erotic stimuli after administration of single doses of methylphenidate, MDMA, or placebo. Methods: We evaluated effects of methylphenidate (40 mg), MDMA (75 mg) and placebo on subjective sexual arousal by viewing erotic pictures using a double‐blind, randomized, placebocontrolled cross‐over design in 30 healthy subjects (15 men, 15 women). In the Sexual Arousal Task (SAT), participants had to evaluate 16 neutral, erotic (implicit sexual), or sexual (explicit sexual) color photographs taken from the International Affective Picture System and to rate how pleasant, exciting/arousing, attractive, likable or erotic they considered these pictures. Results: Methylphenidate significantly increased ratings of arousal compared with both placebo (p<0.01) and MDMA (p<0.001), but only for pictures with an explicit sexual content. Methylphenidate similarly tended to increase ratings of erotic compared with placebo (p<0.05) and MDMA (p<0.05) for pictures with explicit sexual content. MDMA did not alter ratings on any of the dimensions regardless of sexual content. There were no significant differences between male or female participants in any of the ratings or drug effects. Conclusion: Methylphenidate increased ratings of sexual excitation by visual stimuli with explicit sexual content. In contrast, MDMA had no such effects on sexual arousal. The findings indicate that pharmacological stimulation of dopaminergic (methylphenidate) but not of serotonergic (MDMA) neurotransmission enhances sexual drive. It needs to be investigated whether sexual perception or even risk‐associated sexual behavior is altered in subjects using methylphenidate for cognitive enhancement or as treatment for attention deficit hyperactivity disorder."
"477","1","Anxiety during ketamine infusions is associated with negative treatment responses in major depressive disorder.^\nAbout 20 to 30 percent of patients with Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) do not respond to standard treatment and are considered treatment-resistant. The N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) glutamate receptor antagonist ketamine has demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment-resistant MDD, but it is unknown whether its acute psychological effects are related to the later antidepressant effect. Therefore, we investigated the association between antidepressant responses to ketamine and the quality of ketamine-induced psychological experiences in MDD. A total of 31 patients (M = 49.5 ± 11.2 years, 16 women) were treated with three ketamine infusions per week (0.5 mg/ kg over 40 min) administered for two consecutive weeks. Depression severity was assessed using the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) at baseline, after four and 24 h and at end of treatment. The 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D-ASC) was applied four hours after the first infusion to assess the subjective quality of acute psychological effects. Patients with a ≥ 50% MADRS reduction from baseline to end of treatment were considered as responders. After six infusions, 17 of 31 patients (55%) showed a response to ketamine treatment, while 14 patients (45%) had no response. Anxiety-related experiences induced by ketamine were significantly higher in non-responders. Percentage MADRS reduction after four hours and individual levels of ketamine-induced anxiety were predictive of a response at end of treatment. The study demonstrated the considerable impact of ketamine-induced anxiety on the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine. It underpins the importance of considering patients' subjective experiences and underlines the possibility of a phenotypic response predictor."
"3722","1","Neural Correlates of the Shamanic State of Consciousness.^\nPsychedelics have been recognized as model interventions for studying altered states of consciousness. However, few empirical studies of the shamanic state of consciousness, which is anecdotally similar to the psychedelic state, exist. We investigated the neural correlates of shamanic trance using high-density electroencephalography (EEG) in 24 shamanic practitioners and 24 healthy controls during rest, shamanic drumming, and classical music listening, followed by an assessment of altered states of consciousness. EEG data were used to assess changes in absolute power, connectivity, signal diversity, and criticality, which were correlated with assessment measures. We also compared assessment scores to those of individuals in a previous study under the influence of psychedelics. Shamanic practitioners were significantly different from controls in several domains of altered states of consciousness, with scores comparable to or exceeding that of healthy volunteers under the influence of psychedelics. Practitioners also displayed increased gamma power during drumming that positively correlated with elementary visual alterations. Furthermore, shamanic practitioners had decreased low alpha and increased low beta connectivity during drumming and classical music and decreased neural signal diversity in the gamma band during drumming that inversely correlated with insightfulness. Finally, criticality in practitioners was increased during drumming in the low and high beta and gamma bands, with increases in the low beta band correlating with complex imagery and elementary visual alterations. These findings suggest that psychedelic drug-induced and non-pharmacologic alterations in consciousness have overlapping phenomenal traits but are distinct states of consciousness, as reflected by the unique brain-related changes during shamanic trance compared to previous literature investigating the psychedelic state."
"7563","0","Ketamine as a therapeutic agent in major depressive disorder and posttraumatic stress disorder: Potential medicinal and deleterious effects.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) are the most common causes of emotional distress that impair an individual's quality of life. MDD is a chronic mental illness that affects 300 million people across the world. Clinical manifestations of MDD include fatigue, loss of interest in routine tasks, psychomotor agitation, impaired ability to focus, suicidal ideation, hypersomnolence, altered psychosocial functioning, and appetite loss. Individuals with depression also demonstrate a reduced behavioral response while experiencing pleasure, a symptom known as anhedonia. Like MDD, PTSD is a prevalent and debilitating psychiatric disorder resulting from a traumatic incident such as sexual assault, war, severe accident, or natural disaster. Symptoms such as recalling event phases, hypervigilance, irritability, and anhedonia are common in PTSD. Both MDD and PTSD pose enormous socioeconomic burdens across the globe. The search for effective treatment with minimal side effects is still ongoing. Ketamine is known for its anesthetic and analgesic properties. Psychedelic and psychotropic effects of ketamine have been found on the nervous system, which highlights its toxicity. In this article, the effectiveness of ketamine as a potential therapeutic for PTSD and MDD along with its mechanisms of action, clinical trials, and possible side effects have been discussed."
"366","0","Oral Ketamine for Depression, 2: Practical Considerations.^\nThe oral route of administration is probably the least expensive and most convenient way to administer ketamine in indicated contexts in depressed patients. Because only 20%-25% of orally administered ketamine reaches systemic circulation, oral doses of about 2.0-2.5 mg/kg may need to be administered to achieve equivalence to intravenously administered ketamine. In case reports, case series, standard operating practice in ketamine facilities, and randomized controlled trials, oral ketamine has been administered through weight-based dosing and as fixed doses, and the dosing strategy has been one-size-fits-all or individualized through a dose discovery process. Administered doses have ranged from 0.25 to 7.0 mg/kg in weight-based dosing sessions and from 25 mg to 300 mg in fixed dosing sessions. This article reviews strategies for dosing with oral ketamine, dose discovery procedures, rates of dosing during a session, the frequency of dosing sessions and the duration of treatment, treatment in the clinic vs domiciliary treatment, adverse effects and risks, and safety issues. Finally, this article provides a detailed account of practices and experiences with oral ketamine so that readers may know what to expect when the treatment is orally administered. Whereas oral ketamine appears to be a safe and effective treatment and could make ketamine an accessible and affordable intervention in less privileged medical facilities, readers are warned that the literature on oral ketamine is thin and that there are many areas that need more investigation, especially matters related to pharmacokinetics, physiologic effects, abuse potential and strategies to mitigate illicit use, and adverse effects and efficacy relative to other routes of administration. Until studies of a sufficiently high quality become available, the use of oral ketamine to treat depression must be considered experimental."
"6449","1","Ketamine has distinct electrophysiological and behavioral effects in depressed and healthy subjects.^\nKetamine's mechanism of action was assessed using gamma power from magnetoencephalography (MEG) as a proxy measure for homeostatic balance in 35 unmedicated subjects with major depressive disorder (MDD) and 25 healthy controls enrolled in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized cross-over trial of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine. MDD subjects showed significant improvements in depressive symptoms, and healthy control subjects exhibited modest but significant increases in depressive symptoms for up to 1 day after ketamine administration. Both groups showed increased resting gamma power following ketamine. In MDD subjects, gamma power was not associated with the magnitude of the antidepressant effect. However, baseline gamma power was found to moderate the relationship between post-ketamine gamma power and antidepressant response; specifically, higher post-ketamine gamma power was associated with better response in MDD subjects with lower baseline gamma, with an inverted relationship in MDD subjects with higher baseline gamma. This relationship was observed in multiple regions involved in networks hypothesized to be involved in the pathophysiology of MDD. This finding suggests biological subtypes based on the direction of homeostatic dysregulation and has important implications for inferring ketamine's mechanism of action from studies of healthy controls alone."
"8198","1","Assessment of ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter in humans with positron emission tomography.^\nBackground: Comprehensive description of ketamine’s molecular binding profile becomes increasingly pressing as use in real-life patient cohorts widens. Animal studies attribute a significant role in the substance’s antidepressant effects to the serotonergic system. The serotonin transporter is a highly relevant target in this context, because it is central to depressive pathophysiology and treatment. This is, to our knowledge, the first study investigating ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding in vivo in humans. Methods: Twelve healthy subjects were assessed twice using [¹¹C]DASB positron emission tomography. A total of 0.50 mg/kg bodyweight ketamine was administered once i.v. prior to the second positron emission tomography scan. Ketamine plasma levels were determined during positron emission tomography. Serotonin transporter nondisplaceable binding potential was computed using a reference region model, and occupancy was calculated for 4 serotonin transporter-rich regions (caudate, putamen, thalamus, midbrain) and a whole-brain region of interest. Results: After administration of the routine antidepressant dose, ketamine showed < 10% occupancy of the serotonin transporter, which is within the test-retest variability of [¹¹C]DASB. A positive correlation between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy was shown. Conclusions: Measurable occupancy of the serotonin transporter was not detectable after administration of an antidepressant dose of ketamine. This might suggest that ketamine binding of the serotonin transporter is unlikely to be a primary antidepressant mechanism at routine antidepressant doses, as substances that facilitate antidepressant effects via serotonin transporter binding (e.g., selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) show 70% to 80% occupancy. Administration of high-dose ketamine is widening. Based on the positive relationship we find between ketamine plasma levels and occupancy, there is a need for investigation of ketamine’s serotonin transporter binding at higher doses.

Past month prevalence rates of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, Ecstasy, and Ketamine use were compared between a sample of men who have sex with men (MSM), and a general household sample of men, all residing in Chicago. We compared rates of self-reported use, and corrected rates based on the results of drug testing (urine and oral fluid tests). While MSM over 30 years old were significantly more likely than other men in this age group to report past month use of cocaine, test-corrected rates of use were equivalent. On the other hand, test-corrected estimates confirmed elevated rates of Ketamine and Ecstasy use in the MSM sample. Differential disclosure of substance use between MSM and other males may in some cases lead to distorted conclusions about differences in substance use between these groups. The use of biological testing in epidemiological studies of substance use can reduce the uncertainty of such comparisons. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved."
"9031","0","Naltrexone alters the processing of social and emotional stimuli in healthy adults.^\nEndogenous opioids have complex social effects that may depend on specific receptor actions and vary depending on the stage of social behavior (e.g., seeking vs. responding to social stimuli). We tested the effects of a nonspecific opioid antagonist, naltrexone (NTX), on social processing in humans. NTX is used to treat alcohol and opiate dependence, and may affect both mu and kappa-opioid systems. We assessed attention (seeking), and subjective and psychophysiological responses (responding) to positive and negative social stimuli. Based on literature suggesting mu-opioid blockade impairs positive social responses, we hypothesized that NTX would decrease responses to positive social stimuli. We also tested responses to negative stimuli, which might be either increased by NTX's mu-opioid effects or decreased by its kappa-opioid effects. Thirty-four healthy volunteers received placebo, 25mg, or 50mg NTX across three sessions under double-blind conditions. At each session, participants completed measures of attention, identification, and emotional responses for emotional faces and scenes. NTX increased attention to emotional expressions, slowed identification of sadness and fear, and decreased ratings of arousal for social and nonsocial emotional scenes. These findings are more consistent with anxiolytic kappa-antagonist than mu-blocking effects, suggesting effects on kappa receptors may contribute to the clinical effects of NTX."
"5139","1","A Meta-Analysis of Placebo-Controlled Trials of Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy.^\nAfter a two-decade hiatus in which research on psychedelics was essentially halted, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy for mental health conditions have begun to be published. We identified nine randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials of psychedelic-assisted therapy published since 1994. Studies examined psilocybin, LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide), ayahuasca (which contains a combination of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and harmala monoamine oxidase inhibitor alkaloids), and MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine). We compared the standardized mean difference between the experimental and placebo control group at the primary endpoint. Results indicated a significant mean between-groups effect size of 1.21 (Hedges g), which is larger than the typical effect size found in trials of psychopharmacological or psychotherapy interventions. For the three studies that maintained a placebo control through a follow-up assessment, effects were generally maintained at follow-up. Overall, analyses support the efficacy of psychedelic-assisted therapy across four mental health conditions - post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety/depression associated with a life-threatening illness, unipolar depression, and social anxiety among autistic adults. While study quality was high, we identify several areas for improvement regarding the conduct and reporting of trials. Larger trials with more diverse samples are needed to examine possible moderators and mediators of effects, and to establish whether effects are maintained over time."
"7289","0","Retrospective suspect and non-target screening combined with similarity measures to prioritize MDMA and amphetamine synthesis markers in wastewater.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and amphetamine are commonly used psychoactive stimulants. Illegal manufacture of these substances, mainly located in the Netherlands and Belgium, generates large amounts of chemical waste which is disposed in the environment or released in sewer systems. Retrospective analysis of high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) data was implemented to detect synthesis markers of MDMA and amphetamine production in wastewater samples. Specifically, suspect and non-target screening, combined with a prioritization approach based on similarity measures between detected features and mass loads of MDMA and amphetamine was implemented. Two hundred and thirty-five 24 h-composite wastewater samples collected from a treatment plant in the Netherlands between 2016 and 2018 were analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry. Samples were initially separated into two groups (i.e., baseline consumption versus dumping) based on daily loads of MDMA and amphetamine. Significance testing and fold-changes were used to find differences between features in the two groups. Then, associations between peak areas of all features and MDMA or amphetamine loads were investigated across the whole time series using various measures (Euclidian distance, Pearson's correlation coefficient, Spearman's rank correlation coefficient, distance correlation and maximum information coefficient). This unsupervised and unbiased approach was used for prioritization of features and allowed the selection of 28 presumed markers of production of MDMA and amphetamine. These markers could potentially be used to detect dumps in sewer systems, help in determining the synthesis route and track down the waste in the environment."
"8642","0","Substance use and suicide attempts among adolescent males who are members of a sexual minority: A comparison of synthesized substance-use measures.^\nAdolescent sexual minority males (ASMM) are among the highest risk groups for suicide in the United States, with substance use as a significant risk factor. We tested for an association between substance use and suicidality among ASMM from the 2015 and 2017 Youth Risk Behavior Survey (n = 849). We compared several approaches to synthesizing measures of marijuana, cocaine, heroin, ecstasy, methamphetamines, synthetic marijuana, and prescription drug abuse, including several categorized and continuous indices, latent class analysis based on any use of each substance, and latent profile analysis based on use frequency. Using all approaches, substance use was positively associated with suicide attempts independent of covariates. A continuous cumulative index was the best fit to our data (quasi-information criterion = 853.9969) and detected the largest association, with the highest prevalence of suicide attempts among ASMM who used all substances compared with those who used none (adjusted prevalence ratio = 3.35, 95% confidence interval: 2.41, 4.66). A 3-latent-class model had the second best fit to the data (quasi-information criterion = 878.4464), with the highest prevalence of suicide attempts (adjusted prevalence ratio = 2.54, 95% confidence interval: 1.80, 3.57) among the high-substance-use class compared with the low-use class. Substance use is an especially important focal point for targeted interventions reducing suicidality among ASMM."
"4358","1","A direct comparison of the behavioral and physiological effects of methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans.^\nRATIONALE: Despite their chemical similarities, methamphetamine and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produce differing neurochemical and behavioral responses in animals. In humans, individual studies of methamphetamine and MDMA indicate that the drugs engender overlapping and divergent effects; there are only limited data comparing the two drugs in the same individuals. OBJECTIVES: This study examined the effects of methamphetamine and MDMA using a within-subject design. METHODS: Eleven adult volunteers completed this 13-day residential laboratory study, which consisted of four 3-day blocks of sessions. On the first day of each block, participants received oral methamphetamine (20, 40 mg), MDMA (100 mg), or placebo. Drug plasma concentrations, cardiovascular, subjective, and cognitive/psychomotor performance effects were assessed before drug administration and after. Food intake and sleep were also assessed. On subsequent days of each block, placebo was administered and residual effects were assessed. RESULTS: Acutely, both drugs increased cardiovascular measures and ""positive"" subjective effects and decreased food intake. In addition, when asked to identify each drug, participants had difficulty distinguishing between the amphetamines. The drugs also produced divergent effects: methamphetamine improved performance and disrupted sleep, while MDMA increased ""negative"" subjective-effect ratings. Few residual drug effects were noted for either drug. CONCLUSIONS: It is possible that the differences observed could explain the differential public perception and abuse potential associated with these amphetamines. Alternatively, the route of administration by which the drugs are used recreationally might account for the many of the effects attributed to these drugs (i.e., MDMA is primarily used orally, whereas methamphetamine is used by routes associated with higher abuse potential)."
"4359","1","Effects of MDMA and Intranasal oxytocin on social and emotional processing.^\nMDMA (± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'ecstasy') is used recreationally, reportedly because it increases feelings of empathy, sociability, and interpersonal closeness. One line of evidence suggests that MDMA produces these effects by releasing oxytocin, a peptide involved in social bonding. In the current study, we investigated the acute effects of MDMA and oxytocin on social and emotional processing in healthy human volunteers. MDMA users (N = 65) participated in a 4-session, within-between-subjects study in which they received oral MDMA (0.75, 1.5 mg/kg), intranasal oxytocin (20 or 40 IU), or placebo under double-blind conditions. The primary outcomes included measures of emotion recognition and sociability (desire to be with others). Cardiovascular and subjective effects were also assessed. As expected, MDMA dose-dependently increased heart rate and blood pressure and feelings of euphoria (eg, 'High' and 'Like Drug'). On measures of social function, MDMA impaired recognition of angry and fearful facial expressions, and the larger dose (1.5 mg/kg) increased desire to be with others, compared with placebo. Oxytocin produced small but significant increases in feelings of sociability and enhanced recognition of sad facial expressions. Additionally, responses to oxytocin were related to responses to MDMA with subjects on two subjective measures of sociability. Thus, MDMA increased euphoria and feelings of sociability, perhaps by reducing sensitivity to subtle signs of negative emotions in others. The present findings provide only limited support for the idea that oxytocin produces the prosocial effects of MDMA."
"2954","1","Magnetoencephalographic Correlates of Suicidal Ideation in Major Depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Defining the neurobiological underpinnings of suicidal ideation (SI) is crucial to improving our understanding of suicide. This study used magnetoencephalographic gamma power as a surrogate marker for population-level excitation-inhibition balance to explore the underlying neurobiology of SI and depression. In addition, effects of pharmacological intervention with ketamine, which has been shown to rapidly reduce SI and depression, were assessed. METHODS: Data were obtained from 29 drug-free patients with major depressive disorder who participated in an experiment comparing subanesthetic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) with a placebo saline infusion. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected at baseline and after ketamine and placebo infusions. During scanning, patients rested with their eyes closed. SI and depression were assessed, and a linear mixed-effects model was used to identify brain regions where gamma power and both SI and depression were associated. Two regions of the salience network (anterior insula, anterior cingulate) were then probed using dynamic causal modeling to test for ketamine effects. RESULTS: Clinically, patients showed significantly reduced SI and depression after ketamine administration. In addition, distinct regions in the anterior insula were found to be associated with SI compared with depression. In modeling of insula-anterior cingulate connectivity, ketamine lowered the membrane capacitance for superficial pyramidal cells. Finally, connectivity between the insula and anterior cingulate was associated with improvements in depression symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that the anterior insula plays a key role in SI, perhaps via its role in salience detection. In addition, transient changes in superficial pyramidal cell membrane capacitance and subsequent increases in cortical excitability might be a mechanism through which ketamine improves SI."
"7484","1","Rapid and sustained symptom reduction following psilocybin treatment for anxiety and depression in patients with life-threatening cancer: a randomized controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinically significant anxiety and depression are common in patients with cancer, and are associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Historical and recent research suggests a role for psilocybin to treat cancer-related anxiety and depression. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial, 29 patients with cancer-related anxiety and depression were randomly assigned and received treatment with single-dose psilocybin (0.3 mg/kg) or niacin, both in conjunction with psychotherapy. The primary outcomes were anxiety and depression assessed between groups prior to the crossover at 7 weeks. RESULTS: Prior to the crossover, psilocybin produced immediate, substantial, and sustained improvements in anxiety and depression and led to decreases in cancer-related demoralization and hopelessness, improved spiritual wellbeing, and increased quality of life. At the 6.5-month follow-up, psilocybin was associated with enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects (approximately 60-80% of participants continued with clinically significant reductions in depression or anxiety), sustained benefits in existential distress and quality of life, as well as improved attitudes towards death. The psilocybin-induced mystical experience mediated the therapeutic effect of psilocybin on anxiety and depression. CONCLUSIONS: In conjunction with psychotherapy, single moderate-dose psilocybin produced rapid, robust and enduring anxiolytic and anti-depressant effects in patients with cancer-related psychological distress.

"8513","0","Recent developments pertaining to treatment‐resistant depression: A 40‐year perspective.^\nComments on an article by R. S. McIntyre et al. (see record [rid]2024-11189-009[/rid]). The concept of TRD is nearly as old as the first generation of effective treatments for depression, namely electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs) and monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs). The first papers using that concept were published in the 1970s. In that era, an almost intuitive hierarchy emerged on the basis of the clinical effort needed to implement the treatment: TCAs were generally used first, MAOIs second and ECT third for most patients. There were no randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of TRD in that era, though clinical wisdom taught that MAOIs worked in about one half of the cases in which TCAs failed, and ECT was expected to benefit at least 80% of antidepressant non-responders. As a result, clinicians might have predicted that 70-90% of depressed patients could be treated effectively with this three-step proto- algorithm. While it remains to be seen whether intravenous ketamine or intranasal esketamine –the first FDA-approved therapy to result from these observations –will continue to be widely used a decade from now, it is a fact that the paradigm for drug discovery for TRD has changed for the foreseeable future. In this respect, the path for studying the therapeutic potential of neurosteroid drugs such as zuranolone, which is thought to in- directly affect glutamatergic neurotransmission through GABA-A receptor positive allosteric modulation, has been much less arduous than previously possible. Likewise, the paradigm change determined by the proven efficacy of intravenous ketamine, a con- trolled substance with abuse liability and characteristic dissociative effects, has prepared the field for a new wave of studies examining the therapeutic benefit of psilocybin and related psychedelic compounds that were once considered essentially off limits for therapeutic research. Finally, descendants of transcranial magnetic stimulation, including intermittent theta burst stimulation (iTBS) and an accelerated high-dose iTBS protocol utilizing magnetic resonance imaging to guide or target functional connectivity, have given hope for the possibility of viable alternate neuromodulation strategies for patients with more advanced levels of TRD. McIntyre et al’s outline of the evidence concerning TRD, therefore, is timely and provides a thought-provoking overview of an exciting new era in the therapeutics of depression.

"5815","1","Memory deficits associated with recreational use of 'ecstasy' (MDMA).^\nEvidence from both animal, and human, studies suggests that repeated administration of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; 'ecstasy') produces lasting decreases in serotonergic activity. Serotonin is believed to play a modulatory role in a variety of psychological processes, including learning and memory. There are recent reports that polydrug users, who have used ecstasy recreationally, exhibit selective impairments in memory. However, these studies did not compare ecstasy users with polydrug users who had not taken ecstasy, leaving open the possibility that the memory deficits may be associated with a history of use of other illicit drugs. The present study used the Rivermead Behavioural Memory test to investigate immediate and delayed recall in: 25 polydrug-users who had taken more than 20 tablets of ecstasy (MDMA group), 22 participants (polydrug controls) who had never taken ecstasy, but, otherwise has personal characteristics (e.g. age, gender, education, height, weight), and illicit drug use histories, that were generally not significantly different from those of the MDMA group, and 19 participants who had not used illicit drugs but who also had similar personal characteristics (non-drug controls). Participants in the MDMA group recalled significantly fewer ideas (approximately 75% of the number of ideas recalled by participants in either of the other two groups), in both immediate and delayed recall conditions. The two illicit drug-using groups did differ in their estimated IQ scores and their duration of use of LSD, but only the latter proved to be a statistically significant covariate, and the difference in recall performance between the MDMA and polydrug controls groups remained statistically significant when this variable was treated as a covariate. The present findings provide the first evidence that deficits in memory performance in recreational ecstasy users are primarily associated with past exposure to ecstasy, rather than with the other legal and illicit drugs consumed by these individuals, and are consistent with reduced serotonergic modulation of mnemonic function as a result of long-term neurotoxic effects of MDMA in humans."
"120","1","Can 'floating' predict treatment response to ketamine? Data from three randomized trials of individuals with treatment-resistant depression.^\nKetamine has rapid-acting antidepressant properties but also potentially concerning transient dissociative side effects (SEs). Recent studies noted a positive correlation between treatment response to ketamine and general dissociative SEs, as well as ""floating"", a depersonalization SE (a subtype of the dissociative SEs). This analysis sought to determine whether floating mediates treatment response to ketamine. Data were pooled from three double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled ketamine clinical trials across which 82 participants with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) (44 with bipolar depression and 38 with major depressive disorder) received placebo and ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) infusions. SEs were actively solicited in a standardized fashion before and after ketamine infusion. The hypothesis that a post-infusion experience of floating would mediate antidepressant response to ketamine was assessed at 230 min post-infusion and at Day 1. Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score was the dependent variable in a linear mixed effects model. Ketamine significantly decreased MADRS scores (p < 0.0001), but no relationship was detected between floating and MADRS score at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. The hypothesized mediation effect of floating was also not detected at either 230 min or Day 1 post-infusion. Taken together, the findings do not support the hypothesis that ketamine's antidepressant effects are mediated by the dissociative depersonalization subtype SE of floating."
"6725","1","Saturday night fever in ecstasy/MDMA dance clubbers: Heightened body temperature and associated psychobiological changes.^\nAims and rationale: to investigate body temperature and thermal self-ratings of Ecstasy/MDMA users at a Saturday night dance club. Methods: 68 dance clubbers (mean age 21.6 years, 30 females and 38 males), were assessed at a Saturday night dance club, then 2–3 d later. Three subgroups were compared: 32 current Ecstasy users who had taken Ecstasy/MDMA that evening, 10 abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA users on other psychoactive drugs, and 26 non-user controls (predominantly alcohol drinkers). In a comparatively quiet area of the dance club, each unpaid volunteer had their ear temperature recorded, and completed a questionnaire on thermal feelings and mood states. A similar questionnaire was repeated 2–3 d later by mobile telephone. Results: Ecstasy/MDMA users had a mean body temperature 1.2°C higher than non-user controls (P < 0.001), and felt significantly hotter and thirstier. The abstinent Ecstasy/MDMA polydrug user group had a mean body temperature intermediate between the other 2 groups, significantly higher than controls, and significantly lower than current Ecstasy/MDMA users. After 2–3 d of recovery, the Ecstasy/MDMA users remained significantly ‘thirstier’. Higher body temperature while clubbing was associated with greater Ecstasy/MDMA usage at the club, and younger age of first use. Higher temperature also correlated with lower elation and poor memory 2–3 d later. It also correlated positively with nicotine, and negatively with cannabis. Conclusions: Ecstasy/MDMA using dance clubbers had significantly higher body temperature than non-user controls. This heightened body temperature was associated with a number of adverse psychobiological consequences, including poor memory. © 2014, © 2014 The Author(s).

Methods: 152 MDMA users and 81 mephedrone users were recruited through snowballing on social network sites. They completed a standard online questionnaire for either mephedrone or MDMA. The questions covered the average amount taken per session, the longest duration of usage in the last 12-months, subjective effects while on-drug, and recovery effects in the days afterwards. Results: Mephedrone users reported a significantly longer maximum session of use than MDMA users. Mephedrone users also reported a significantly greater average amount used per session. The majority of on-drug subjective ratings did not differ between drugs, with similar increases in entactogenic effects. Although mephedrone users did report significantly more frequent issues with sleeping, anger and anxiety. In relation to recovery, mephedrone users reported more frequent craving, nasal irritation, paranoia, and relationship difficulties. Mephedrone users also rated general recovery effects as more severe over the seven-day period following use, taking more days to feel normal. Conclusions: The acute effects of MDMA and mephedrone were broadly similar. However, the recovery period for mephedrone was more enduring, possibly due to the longer duration of acute session usage."
"1948","1","A prospective cohort study on sustained effects of low-dose ecstasy use on the brain in new ecstasy users.^\nIt is debated whether ecstasy use has neurotoxic effects on the human brain and what the effects are of a low dose of ecstasy use. We prospectively studied sustained effects (>2 weeks abstinence) of a low dose of ecstasy on the brain in ecstasy-naive volunteers using a combination of advanced MR techniques and self-report questionnaires on psychopathology as part of the NeXT (Netherlands XTC Toxicity) study. Outcomes of proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1H-MRS), diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), perfusion-weighted imaging (PWI), and questionnaires on depression, impulsivity, and sensation seeking were compared in 30 subjects (12M, 21.8+/-3.1 years) in two sessions before and after first ecstasy use (1.8+/-1.3 tablets). Interval between baseline and follow-up was on average 8.1+/-6.5 months and time between last ecstasy use and follow-up was 7.7+/-4.4 weeks. Using 1H-MRS, no significant changes were observed in metabolite concentrations of N-acetylaspartate (NAA), choline (Cho), myo-inositol (mI), and creatine (Cr), nor in ratios of NAA, Cho, and mI relative to Cr. However, ecstasy use was followed by a sustained 0.9% increase in fractional anisotropy (FA) in frontoparietal white matter, a 3.4% decrease in apparent diffusion (ADC) in the thalamus and a sustained decrease in relative regional cerebral blood volume (rrCBV) in the thalamus (-6.2%), dorsolateral frontal cortex (-4.0%), and superior parietal cortex (-3.0%) (all significant at p<0.05, paired t-tests). After correction for multiple comparisons, only the rrCBV decrease in the dorsolateral frontal cortex remained significant. We also observed increased impulsivity (+3.7% on the Barratt Impulsiveness Scale) and decreased depression (-28.0% on the Beck Depression Inventory) in novel ecstasy users, although effect sizes were limited and clinical relevance questionable. As no indications were found for structural neuronal damage with the currently used techniques, our data do not support the concern that incidental ecstasy use leads to extensive axonal damage. However, sustained decreases in rrCBV and ADC values may indicate that even low ecstasy doses can induce prolonged vasoconstriction in some brain areas, although it is not known whether this effect is permanent. Additional studies are needed to replicate these findings."

The impact of the mTOR inhibitor everolimus on the mood of breast cancer patients is unknown. Materials and methods Consecutive, post-menopausal metastatic breast cancer patients receiving hormone therapy +/- everolimus were prospectively followed-up using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the MADRS (Montgomery and Asberg Depression Rating Scale) questionnaires. Results Post hoc tests comparing everolimus + hormonotherapy to hormonotherapy alone demonstrated a significant effect of everolimus after 6 weeks of treatment on BDI scores (t(1,38) = -2.0716, p < 0.05), and after 3 weeks (t(1,38) = -3.9165, p < 0.001) and 6 weeks of treatment (t(1,38) = -2.0373, p < 0.05) on MADRS scores. Analysis within each treatment group showed that the effect of time since treatment initiation on BDI and MADRS scores was specifically observed in the everolimus + hormonotherapy group (F(2,34) = 11.875, p < 0.001 and F(2,34) = 7.820, p < 0.01 respectively), but not in the hormonotherapy alone group (F(2.34) = 1.671, p > 0.2 and F(2,34) = 0.830, p > 0.2 respectively). Conclusions The mTOR inhibitor everolimus induces significant mood alterations in breast cancer patients. The evaluation of psychiatric symptoms is not only mandatory in the context of phase 1, dose-finding studies of PI3K/Akt/mTOR inhibitors, but is also clinically relevant in daily practice."
"2561","0","Sleep-dependent declarative memory consolidation--unaffected after blocking NMDA or AMPA receptors but enhanced by NMDA coagonist D-cycloserine.^\nSleep has a pivotal role in the consolidation of declarative memory. The coordinated neuronal replay of information encoded before sleep has been identified as a key process. It is assumed that the repeated reactivation of firing patterns in glutamatergic neuron assemblies translates into plastic synaptic changes underlying the formation of longer‐term neuronal representations. Here, we tested the effects of blocking and enhancing glutamatergic neurotransmission during sleep on declarative memory consolidation in humans. We conducted three placebo‐controlled, crossover, double‐blind studies in which participants learned a word‐pair association task. Afterwards, they slept in a sleep laboratory and received glutamatergic modulators. Our first two studies aimed at impairing consolidation by administering the NMDA receptor blocker ketamine and the AMPA receptor blocker caroverine during retention sleep, which, paradoxically, remained unsuccessful, inasmuch as declarative memory performance was unaffected by the treatment. However, in the third study, administration of the NMDA receptor coagonist D‐cycloserine (DCS) during retention sleep facilitated consolidation of declarative memory (word pairs) but not consolidation of a procedural control task (finger sequence tapping). Administration of DCS during a wake interval remained without effect on retention of word pairs but improved encoding of numbers. From the overall pattern, we conclude that the consolidation of hippocampus‐dependent declarative memory during sleep relies on NMDA‐related plastic processes that differ from those processes leading to wake encoding. We speculate that glutamatergic activation during sleep is not only involved in consolidation but also in forgetting of hippocampal memory with both processes being differentially sensitive to DCS and unselective blockade of NMDA and AMPA receptors."
"8706","1","The effects of low dose ketamine on sensory gating, neuroendocrine secretion and behavior in healthy human subjects.^\nRecently, much interest has been given to the role of glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors (NMDA) in sensory gating, such as prepulse inhibition (PPI) and reduction of the P50 evoked response potential (ERP). Currently, mainly animal data are available describing the role of NMDA receptors in these stimulus evaluation processes. Human data are virtually lacking and are potentially important, for instance for the understanding of sensory gating deficits observed in schizophrenia. Therefore, the effects of the NMDA antagonist ketamine, in a dose of 0.3 mg/kg i.v., on concurrent assessment of PPI and P50 reduction was studied in 18 healthy male volunteers. Ketamine was administered in a pseudo-steady state model with a subacute loading dose. In addition, the effects of ketamine on behavior, vital signs, homovanillic acid (HVA) plasma levels and secretion of cortisol and luteinizing hormone (LH) were also determined. Ketamine did not significantly alter PPI or the reduction of the P50 ERP. A small but significant increase in Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) total scores and BPRS composite scores ""thinking disorder"" and ""withdrawal/retardation"" was observed. Several subjects experienced visual perceptional alterations, but complex hallucinations did not occur. Ketamine induced mild analgesia and coordination problems. In addition, ketamine induced a marked rise in cortisol secretion, while LH secretion was not affected. Finally, systolic and diastolic, blood pressure and heart rate increased during ketamine infusion. Although in humans NMDA receptors may not be involved in the regulation of PPI and P50 reduction, the most likely explanation for the lack of effect of ketamine on these sensory gating paradigms is the dose used in this experiment. However, using a higher dose is hampered by the aspecificity of racemic ketamine. Future studies should use the enantiomer S-ketamine, which is more specific to NMDA receptors, to evaluate the involvement of NMDA receptors in these neurophysiological processes further."
"6635","1","Shifting characteristics of ecstasy users ages 12–34 in the United States, 2007–2014.^\nBackground: Ecstasy/MDMA has been one of the most prevalent party drugs for decades, and powder ecstasy recently increased in popularity. We examined trends in use to determine who to best target for prevention and harm reduction. Methods: Secondary analysis of the 2007–2014 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, a repeated cross-sectional, nationally representative probability sample, was conducted. Linear trends in past-year ecstasy use and trends in demographic and other past-year substance use characteristics among ecstasy users were examined among participants ages 12–34 (N = 332,560). Results: Past-year prevalence of ecstasy use was stable across years at 2% (P = 0.693). Over time, the proportion of ecstasy users with a college degree increased from 11.5% in 2007/08 to 24.5% in 2013/14 (P < 0.001). The proportion of users who were age 12–17 decreased, as did proportions of users who are non-Hispanic black, and reported income <$20,000/year (Ps < 0.001). Prevalence of past-year use of marijuana, LSD, ketamine, and DMT/AMT/Foxy increased among ecstasy users (Ps < 0.05); DMT/AMT/Foxy use increased more than four-fold from 2.1% in 2007/08 to 8.7% in 2013/14. Perception of great risk associated with LSD use decreased among users and ease of obtaining LSD increased (Ps < 0.05). Past-year use of 5 or more other substances also increased over time (P < 0.05). Conclusions: Ecstasy use in the US appears to be increasing among those with college degrees and use of other substances among ecstasy users is growing—particularly use of otherwise rare substances such as tryptamines. Results inform prevention and harm reduction strategies in this increasingly shifting group of ecstasy users."
"1754","0","Separating the agony from ecstasy: <i>R</i>(-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine has prosocial and therapeutic-like effects without signs of neurotoxicity in mice.^\nS,R(+/-)-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (SR-MDMA) is an amphetamine derivative with pro social and putative therapeutic effects. Ongoing clinical trials are investigating it as a treatment for post traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other conditions. However, its potential for adverse effects such as hyperthermia and neurotoxicity may limit its clinical viability. We investigated the hypothesis that one of the two enantiomers of SR-MDMA, R-MDMA, would retain the prosocial and therapeutic effects but with fewer adverse effects. Using male Swiss Webster and C57BL/6 mice, the prosocial effects of R-MDMA were measured using a social interaction test, and the therapeutic-like effects were assessed using a Pavlovian fear conditioning and extinction paradigm relevant to PTSD. Locomotor activity and body temperature were tracked after administration, and neurotoxicity was evaluated post-mortem. R-MDMA significantly increased murine social interaction and facilitated extinction of conditioned freezing. Yet, unlike racemic MDMA, it did not increase locomotor activity, produce signs of neurotoxicity, or increase body temperature. A key pharmacological difference between R-MDMA and racemic MDMA is that R-MDMA has much lower potency as a dopamine releaser. Pretreatment with a selective dopamine D1 receptor antagonist prevented SR-MDMA-induced hyperthermia, suggesting that differential dopamine signaling may explain some of the observed differences between the treatments. Together, these results indicate that the prosocial and therapeutic effects of SR-MDMA may be separable from the stimulant, thermogenic, and potential neurotoxic effects. To what extent these findings translate to humans will require further investigation, but these data suggest that R-MDMA could be a more viable therapeutic option for the treatment of PTSD and other disorders for which SR-MDMA is currently being investigated.

"1510","1","Safety, tolerability, and clinical and neural effects of single-dose psilocybin in obsessive-compulsive disorder: protocol for a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin may help treat obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD). To date, only one open-label study of psilocybin for OCD exists, necessitating further investigation with a randomized controlled design. The neural correlates of psilocybin's effects on OCD have also not been studied. OBJECTIVES: This first-of-its-kind trial aims to evaluate the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of psilocybin in the treatment of OCD, provide preliminary evidence on the effects of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, and elucidate neural mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's effects on OCD. DESIGN: We use a randomized (1:1), double-blind, placebo-controlled, non-crossover design to examine the clinical and neural effects of either a single dose of oral psilocybin (0.25 mg/kg) or active placebo-control agent (250 mg of niacin) on OCD symptoms. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We are enrolling 30 adult participants at a single site in Connecticut, USA who have failed at least one trial of standard care treatment (medication/psychotherapy) for OCD. All participants will also receive unstructured, non-directive psychological support during visits. Aside from safety, primary outcomes include OCD symptoms over the past 24 h, assessed by the Acute Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale and Visual Analog Scale ratings. These are collected by blinded, independent raters at baseline and the primary endpoint of 48 h post-dosing. Total follow-up is 12 weeks post-dosing. Resting state neuroimaging data will be collected at baseline and primary endpoint. Participants randomized to placebo will be offered the chance to return for an open-label dose of 0.25 mg/kg. ETHICS STATEMENT: All participants will be required to provide written informed consent. The trial (protocol v. 5.2) was approved by the institutional review board (HIC #2000020355) and registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03356483). DISCUSSION: This study may represent an advance in our ability to treat refractory OCD, and pave the way for future studies of neurobiological mechanisms of OCD that may respond to psilocybin."
"8148","1","Use of psychotropics drugs among students: Prevalence and associated social factors.^\nObjective. To determine the prevalence of the heavy use of drugs among elementary and high school students in a sample of public and private schools, and to identify associated demographic, psychological, cultural and social factors. Methods. This report describes a cross-sectional study using an intention-type sampling technique that compared public schools in central and peripheral areas and private schools. An anonymous self-administered questionnaire was applied. The sample consisted of 2,287 elementary and high school students in the city of Campinas in 1998. Heavy use of drugs was defined as the use of drugs on 20 or more days during the 30 days preceding the survey (WHO, 1981). For the statistical analysis, polytomic logistic regression analysis (logit model) was utilized to identify factors that influenced this manner of using drugs. Results. Heavy use of legal and illegal drugs was found as follows: alcohol (11.9%), tobacco (11.7%), marijuana (4.4%), solvents (1.8%), cocaine (1.4%), medications (1.1%) and ecstasy (0.7%). The heavy use of drugs was greatest among students at the city-center public school who had daytime jobs and studied in the evenings. These students were in the A and B socioeconomic classes and had had little religious education during childhood. Conclusions. Greater availability of cash and specific socialization patterns were identified as factors associated with the heavy use of drugs among students."
"6377","1","The Psychedelic Debriefing in Alcohol Dependence Treatment: Illustrating Key Change Phenomena through Qualitative Content Analysis of Clinical Sessions.^\nResearch on the clinical applications of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has demonstrated promising early results for treatment of alcohol dependence. Detailed description of the content and methods of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy, as it is conducted in clinical settings, is scarce. Methods: An open-label pilot (proof-of-concept) study of psilocybin-assisted treatment of alcohol dependence (NCT01534494) was conducted to generate data for a phase 2 RCT (NCT02061293) of a similar treatment in a larger population. The present paper presents a qualitative content analysis of the 17 debriefing sessions conducted in the pilot study, which occurred the day after corresponding psilocybin medication sessions. Results: Participants articulated a series of key phenomena related to change in drinking outcomes and acute subjective effects of psilocybin. Discussion: The data illuminate change processes in patients' own words during clinical sessions, shedding light on potential therapeutic mechanisms of change and how participants express effects of psilocybin. This study is unique in analyzing actual clinical sessions, as opposed to interviews of patients conducted separately from treatment."
"3711","0","Potential benefit of lamotrigine in managing ketamine use disorder.^\nKetamine is an anesthetic derivative of phencyclidine (PCP; 'Angel dust') with dissociative, analgesic and psychedelic properties. Ketamine has become a popular recreational drug of abuse in many parts of the world in recent years. The preclinical studies demonstrate the reinforcing effects of ketamine and long-term ketamine abuse induces a delayed and persistent upregulation of dopamine system. In humans, there have been concerns about its liability to development of addiction. The dilemma of mental professionals in managing the treatment-seeking ketamine abusers comes from a lack of effective pharmacotherapy. Limiting evidence showed that lamotrigine, which inhibits glutamate release, is effective to reduce cocaine craving. We propose that lamotrigine might be beneficial for managing ketamine use disorder clinically. We also reported one case of ketamine use disorder who experienced a great reduction in craving and ketamine use after taking lamotrigine. Although the mechanisms underlying neuroadaptation and reward related to ketamine are not entirely clear, future clinical trials are needed to advance our understanding of the benefit yielded by lamotrigine to treat ketamine use disorder."

The publishers regret that the email address of the corresponding author was published incorrectly. The correct email address is: Peter.Boeijinga@forenap.com. In the article, the legend for Table 1 was not included and Figure 2a was incorrect. The correct table and figure are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2007-11032-010[/rid]). Disturbances in integrative function have been consistently described in psychotic disorder; for instance, prepulse inhibition of the startle reflex (startle-PPI) which is a marker of sensory gating, is deficient in persons with schizophrenia. The N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produces in control subjects a spectrum of neurobehavioral symptoms like encountered in schizophrenia, and disrupts startle-PPI in animals. In the present study, we investigated in 12 healthy subjects whether ketamine would reduce sensory-gating in auditory responses at doses which produce psychotic symptoms. In a double-blind, crossover design loading doses of 0.024, 0.081 and 0.27 mg/kg or saline were employed, followed by maintenance infusion for 120 min. A passive paradigm has been developed which consisted in tone bursts, preceded or not by a (near-threshold) click at intervals of 100 ms or 500 ms. Brain electromagnetic activity imaging of the responses to sound stimuli has been carried out by way of a 148-channel magnetoencephalography-system. Actual evoked response amplitudes and underlying equivalent current dipole strengths have been compared to multielectrode evoked potentials from the scalp. A click stimulus is capable to inhibit test responses under placebo at the 100ms interval. During maintenance infusion of ketamine at steady-state (for >30 min) after 0.27 mg/kg, no such amplitude changes were observed anymore (p<0.05) and under these circumstances significant increases in Brief Psychiatric Rating scale and Scale for the Assessment of Negative Symptoms scores were evidenced (p<0.001). Intermediate effects have been observed when the dose was lowered to 0.081 mg/kg. The present results have shown that ketamine may induce a psychotic-like clinical state associated with gating deficits in healthy subjects.

"8877","1","Effects of 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine on Conditioned Fear Extinction and Retention in a Crossover Study in Healthy Subjects.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has shown initial promise as an adjunct in psychotherapy to treat posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Its efficacy and safety have been demonstrated across phase I-III studies. However, the mechanism underlying the potential utility of MDMA to treat PTSD in humans has not yet been thoroughly investigated. Preliminary evidence suggests that MDMA may facilitate fear extinction recall, which may be through the release of oxytocin. To test this hypothesis, we examined the efficacy of acute MDMA treatment to enhance fear extinction learning and recall. Methods: We used a two-period, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover design in 30 healthy male subjects who received a placebo and a single dose of MDMA (125 mg). Fear extinction was tested using two separate Pavlovian fear conditioning paradigms, one using skin conductance response (SCR), and the other fear-potentiated startle (FPS) to conditioned cues. MDMA treatment occurred after fear conditioning and 2 h before extinction learning. Extinction recall was tested 23 h after MDMA intake. Additional outcome measures included subjective effects, emotion recognition tasks, plasma levels of oxytocin, and pharmacokinetics. Results: Fear conditioning and extinction learning were successful in both fear extinction paradigms (generalized eta-squared [ges] for SCR: 0.08; FPS: 0.07). Compared to placebo treatment, MDMA treatment significantly reduced SCRs to the reinforced conditioned stimulus (CS+) during extinction learning (ges = 0.03) and recall (ges = 0.06). Intensity of the subjective effects of MDMA (good effect, trust, and openness) during extinction learning negatively correlated with the discrimination between CS+ and the safety stimulus (CS-) during recall. MDMA did not influence FPS to conditioned cues. Oxytocin concentration was increased fourfold on average by MDMA during acute effects but was not associated with fear extinction outcomes. Conclusions: MDMA treatment facilitated rapid fear extinction and retention of extinction as measured by SCR to fear cues, in line with animal studies of MDMA facilitation of extinction. However, this effect may be limited to certain forms of learned fear responses, as it was not observed in the extinction model using startle reactivity as the outcome. This study provides further evidence for the facilitation of extinction with MDMA treatment and suggests this may be a component of its efficacy when paired with psychotherapy.

"8478","1","Investigation of Ayahuasca β-Carboline Alkaloids and Tryptamine in Sweat Samples from Religious Community Participants by GC-MS.^\nAyahuasca, a hallucinogenic beverage used in religious rituals in South America, has become a global phenomenon. Its main active components are the β-carbolines alkaloids, harmine (HRM) and harmaline (HRL), as well as the potent hallucinogen N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Despite its rising consumption, information regarding possible clinical applications and toxicological effects of ayahuasca is still limited. This study presents the first investigation of the use of sweat for the determination of DMT, HRM and HRL in ayahuasca users during a religious ritual. Sweat is an alternative matrix with advantages over many conventional biological samples, mainly because the collection procedure is non-invasive, easy and simple and samples can be collected without disturbing the religious ritual. In the study, solid-phase extraction was performed under basic conditions. Linearity was observed ranging from 20 to 1500 ng/patch with coefficients of determination (R2) higher than 0.99 for all analytes. The results indicated high selectivity for all investigated analytes, with extraction efficiency exceeding 70%, accuracy ranging from 87.5 to 102.4%, intra-assay precision of 1.85-9.44% and inter-assay precision between 3.34 and 9.85%. The limits of detection were 15 ng/patch for HRM and HRL and 10 ng/patch for DMT. The sweat proved to be a viable option to monitor ayahuasca use."

Ketamine's antidepressant effect was firstly described in 1973 and nowadays its therapeutic value as a fast- and long- lasting antidepressant has been extensively established. Ketamine is an antagonist of the N-Methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and its main mechanism of action via NMDAR inhibition expressed in GABAergic (gamma-Aminobutyric acid, GABA) interneurons may be relayed to its antidepressant effects. This review aims to describe the pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic profile of ketamine when used for treatment-resistant depression. Moreover, ketamine is a racemic mixture consisting of two enantiomers, R- and S- ketamine. We describe the pharmacology of esketamine, along with the guidelines for effective and safe intranasal administration of esketamine. Lastly, this review presents sex differences in preclinical and clinical studies of ketamine and esketamine administration."

Patients with buprenorphine and carbamazepine showed a significantly better psychological state after the first and second weeks of treatment. Above all, the buprenorphine‐treated patients demonstrated a less marked tiredness, sensitiveness and depressive state as well as a more prominent elevated mood during the detoxification process. Seven non‐completers (after 7 days: four of 12 = 33.3%; after 14 days: seven of 12 = 58.3%) were treated with methadone and carbamazepine and five non‐completers (after 7 days: two of 14 = 14.3%; after 14 days: five of 14 = 35.7%) received buprenorphine and carbamazepine. The difference in the overall dropout rate after day 14 was not significant. The present study supports the hypothesis that the combination of buprenorphine and carbamazepine leads to a better clinical outcome than does a combination of methadone and carbamazepine in the detoxification of opioid addicts with additional multiple drug abuse. The buprenorphine and carbamazepine‐regimen provides a more effective short‐term relief of affective disturbances than does methadone and carbamazepine. No severe side effects occurred during the treatment period in both groups."
"4420","1","The Safety, Clinical, and Neurophysiological Effects of Intranasal Ketamine in Patients Who Do Not Respond to Electroconvulsive Therapy: Protocol for a Pilot, Open-Label Clinical Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder is among the most disabling illnesses worldwide, with a lifetime prevalence of 16.2%. Research suggests that 20% to 40% of patients with depression do not respond to pharmacotherapy, developing treatment-resistant depression. Electroconvulsive therapy is the gold standard for treating individuals with treatment-resistant depression, with remission rates of approximately 75% to 90%. However, 10% to 25% of patients do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, and many are unable to tolerate it due to the side effects. Both groups are considered to be patients who do not respond to electroconvulsive therapy, because both groups continue to exhibit symptoms of severe depression, have a limited number of treatment options available, and are in need of rapid treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, has been shown to exert rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression when administered in subanesthetic doses through 40-minute intravenous infusions. Recently, a ketamine compound, esketamine (Spravato), that is administered through the intranasal route received regulatory approval by the US Food and Drug Administration and Health Canada to treat depression. However, esketamine is challenging to access due to high costs and limited availability. Racemic ketamine (rketamine) is cheap and easy to access; however, the effects in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy have yet to be understood or tested. This study will use transcranial magnetic stimulation to study mechanisms of human brain cortical physiology at the systemic level to identify neurobiomarkers of response. OBJECTIVE: The objective of this open-label pilot clinical trial is to test the feasibility and safety of intranasal ketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy. The primary outcome is to determine the feasibility of a larger randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for clinical indicators in unipolar depression. The secondary outcome is to determine the preliminary effects of an intervention on clinical outcomes, such as depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation, and quality of living. The third outcome is to explore neurophysiological changes as measured by transcranial magnetic stimulation electromyography and electroencephalography to measure changes in cortical excitability as potential predictors of clinical response. METHODS: A sterile solution of racemic ketamine hydrochloride will be administered twice per week for 4 weeks (8 sessions) intranasally to patients with treatment-resistant depression who did not respond to or could not tolerate an acute course of electroconvulsive therapy. We will recruit 25 adults (24-65 years old) over the course of 2 years from an academic psychiatric hospital in Toronto, Canada. RESULTS: This study has received ethics approval, and funding has been secured. The study is currently active. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first study to test repeated doses of intranasal rketamine in patients who have not responded to electroconvulsive therapy for depression. Results from this study will (1) inform the development of a larger adequately powered randomized controlled trial to test the efficacy of intranasal ketamine for depression and (2) determine potential neurophysiological markers of clinical response.

Nineteen subjects who tried the beverage in Santo Daime rituals and nine subjects who tried it in União do Vegetal rituals were evaluated one to four days before their first ayahuasca experience in life and one to two weeks after this experience. Semistructured interviews and a structured psychiatric scale were used in the first evaluation to elicit set variables concerning attitudes towards the ayahuasca experience and to elicit mental health status. Mental health status was reassessed in the second evaluation, which also included a semistructured interview concerning the phenomenology of altered states of consciousness (ASCs). Predominantly positive expectancies concerning the ayahuasca experience were the most prominent findings concerning set variables. Visual phenomena, numinousness, peacefulness, insights and a distressing reaction were the most salient ASC experiences. A significant reduction of the intensity of minor psychiatric symptoms occurred in the Santo Daime group after the hallucinogen experience. Subjects in both groups reported behavioral changes towards assertiveness, serenity and vivacity/joy. The set and setting hypothesis, suggestibility processes, as well as the supposed unique effects of ayahuasca are used in discussing these findings."
"6215","0","Comparision of Motor Seizure Duration of Ketofol and Propofol for Electroconvulsive Therapy.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is a common treatment method used in severe depression and other psychiatric diseases. Currently, most ECT procedures are carried out with muscle paralysis under general anesthesia. It is important to establish an accurate balance between adequate anesthesia depth and optimal seizure duration. The objective of anesthesia during ECT is to provide a rapid onset and balance of both unconsciousness and muscle relaxation for the duration of the electrical stimulus and subsequent seizure .Therefore, anesthetics that are used for general anesthesia during ECT should have rapid onset, rapid emergence, no interference with seizure activity and longer seizure duration. A motor seizure lasting 20‐25 seconds at minimum has been typically recommended for therapeutic efficacy of ECT . Common drugs used for ECT anesthesia are methohexital, thiopental, etomidate, propofol and ketamine. Methohexital exerts depressant action on seizure activity and is contraindicated in patients acute intermittent porphyria. Etomidate causes increased incidence of emesis. Similarly incidence of sinus bradycardia and premature ventricular contraction increased with the use of thiopental during ECT procedures . For these reasons methohexital, thiopental and etomidate are not used in current anesthetic practice for electroconvulsive therapy Propofol as an anaesthetic in ECT has favorable characteristics such as rapid onset and emergence from anesthesia, minimal postoperative confusion and a lower incidence of hypertension or tachycardia during induction of anesthesia. However, it produces a dose‐ dependent decrease in seizure duration . Ketamine, is also used as an anesthetic agent in ECT because it has a favorable seizure inducing effect and increased seizure duration. But it is also not devoid of disadvantages. Its main disadvantages are that it produces hypertension, delayed recovery and precipitates psychomimetic emergence phenomena . So ketofol (1:1combination of ketamine and propofol) can be a good alternative to either propofol or ketamine used alone for anesthetic management for ECT. Ketamine mitigates propofol‐induced hypotension, and propofol mitigates ketamine‐induced vomiting and emergence agitation. Ketofol can also have better outcome on motor seizure duration than propofol alone. Therefore, the present study is designed to test the hypothesis that ketofol would be a good alternative anesthetic agent and better than propofol for ECT procedures.After obtaining approval from Institutional Review committee (IRC) of TUTH and Nepal health research council (NHRC) the process of enrolling the eligible patients into the study will be started. Patients will be assessed for eligibility. Patients meeting the inclusion criteria and not having the exclusion criteria will be enrolled in the study. Patients will be divided into two groups: Group P (propofol group,n=27) and Group K (ketofol group ,n=27) using computer generated random numbers. Blinding will be done by sealed envelope technique. Pre‐anesthetic checkup will be conducted and a detailed history and complete physical examination will be done prior to procedure. Informed consent will be taken from the legal guardian of patient. Patient will be transferred to the pre anesthetic room. Baseline hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, SPO2 and HR) will be taken and recorded. An 18 G IV cannula will be secured in appropriate hand of patient. Patient will be premedicated with glycopyrolate 0.2 mg 30 minutes prior to procedure. Patient will be transferred to operation theatre. III ECG leads, SPO2 probe and NIBP pressure cuff will be attached. Heart rate (HR), systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), mean arterial pressure (MAP) and oxygen saturation (SPO2) will be continually monitored. Preoxygenation will be done via facemask at the rate of 5liter/min for 5 minutes. Anesthesia assistant will pick an envelope for each patient. Test solution will be prepared by anesthesia assistant as per the instructions in the envelope. Group K ‐ In 1 ml syringe, 2ml of ketamine (50mg/ml solution) and 8ml of normal saline will be drawn to make the 10mg/ml solution of ketamine. Finally in another new 10 ml syringe 5ml of the freshly prepared solution of ketamine (10mg/ml) and 5ml of propofol (10mg/ml) will be mixed. The study drug thus prepared will contain 5mg /ml of propofol and 5mg / ml of ketamine. There will be two such 10ml syringe of ketofol. Group P ‐ propofol (10mg/ml solution) will be drawn in labeled 10ml syringe. Two such 10ml syringes of propofol will be prepared. Patient in Group K will be administered an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg ketofol (0.25 mg/kg of propofol + 0.25 mg/kg of ketamine). Similarly, patient in Group P will be given an initial dose of 0.5mg/kg propofol. In both the group this initial dose will be given within 15 seconds. Five seconds after administration of drug, patient will be assessed for unresponsiveness to verbal commands (by calling patient's name) & loss of eyelash reflex. Then titrated dose of drug will be given at the rate of 1ml every 5 seconds until the patient no longer responds to verbal commands and there is loss of eyelash reflex. The required total dose of propofol or ketofol will be recorded. After loss of consciousness, hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP, HR & SPO2) will be taken and recorded. An isolated forearm technique will be performed by inflating the tourniquet in arm where the iv cannula is not placed. Then, succinylcholine, 1 mg/kg iv will be administered. Ventilation will be assisted with 100 % oxygen via face mask in all groups during the procedure. Bite block will be used prior to application of bifrontal electrodes. Then a psychiatrist blinded to the study groups will administer electrical stimuli through bifrontal electrodes. The frequency will be set at 90Hz and current will be set at 800 milliampere. The duration of the motor seizure will be defined as the time from the ECT stimulus to cessation of tonic‐clonic motor activity in the 'isolated' arm. After the end of seizure, bite block will be removed and ventilation will be continued with 100% oxygen via face mask. The duration of motor seizures will be recorded. Hemodynamic parameters (SBP, DBP, MAP and HR) will be recorded 1mins and 5 mins after the end of seizure. Common complication encountered during ECT are transient hypertension and tachycardia. Esmolol 5mg iv bolus will be given during such episodes. The time from the end of succinylcholine administration until spontaneous breathing, eye opening, and obeying commands will be recorded. Once the patient is awake, obeys commands and maintains oxygen saturation without supplemental oxygen, the patient will be transferred to postoperative room. Patient will be monitored with ECG, pulse oximeter and noninvasive blood pressure for one hour in postoperative room and then the patient will be transferred."

This systematic review was conducted to evaluate the efficacy and tolerability of alternative drugs and assess the possibility of their use as treatment options for obsessive-compulsive-disorder. The Scientific databases PubMed, Science Direct, Google Scholar, Cochrane, Directory of Open Access Journals, MedRxiv and BioRxiv, were searched from inception to March 2022, using appropriate search strategies for each drug and following the Prisma guidelines 2020. Studies were selected according to the already set criteria and assessed for bias. Data were extracted, and descriptive and continuous data were analyzed and presented as frequency/percentage and mean. A total of 16 observational and interventional studies were included for data extraction. The studies focused on four drugs, Psilocybin (n=4), Cannabis (n=7), Nicotine (n=3), and Morphine (n=2), that were used to test out their effect on OCD symptoms. Overall, the majority of the studies showed promising results by documenting a reduction in Y-BOCS scores. However, few subjects, specifically those using nicotine or Cannabis, did not affect their condition or self-reported worsening symptoms. Few side effects were also noticed. This systematic review found that the drugs mostly showed a positive response. All Psilocybin and morphine users, 88.2% and 74.1% of the nicotine and Cannabis users, respectively, reported experiencing the positive effect of these drugs, indicating that these drugs have the potential to be used in the management of OCD. However, further research is required in this arena to thoroughly understand the mechanism of action by which these drugs produce their therapeutic effect. Policies to destigmatize and encourage clinical trials with these drugs are crucial for exploring the use of these drugs as a treatment option for OCD."
"4432","1","Decision-making in polydrug amphetamine-type stimulant users: an fMRI study.^\nQualitative poor decision-making and associated altered neuronal activation patterns have been described for the users of several drugs, amongst others for stimulants like amphetamine and MDMA. Deficits in decision-making might be caused by an augmented attraction to short-term rewarding properties despite negative long-term consequences, leading to rigid stimulus-response patterns. In the present imaging study, we investigated decision-making and associated neuronal activation in three groups differing in their exposure to amphetamine and MDMA. An established paradigm on risky choices was used to evaluate decision-making performance and corresponding functional magnet resonance imaging (fMRI) activation. Subjects could choose between a low-risk control gamble and an experimental gamble, which always differed in the probability of winning or losing, as well as the magnitudes of monetary gain or loss. Experienced users (EU), users with low exposure to stimulants and drug-naive controls, did not differ from each other in behavioral performance. In accordance with our hypotheses, the anticipation of reward led to an activation of primarily the frontal cortex and the striatum in low-exposure users and drug-naive controls. In contrast, frontal and parietal activation was observed in all groups when the actual outcome of an experimental gamble was presented. EU displayed more activation compared to both control groups when there was a high probability of winning. The study at hand supports the hypothesis that neuronal activation patterns might even differ between drug users and healthy controls when no behavioral deficits are apparent. In EU, the probability of the occurrence of an event has more influence on neuronal activation than on the actual magnitude of reinforcing properties of this event."

A total of eleven studies were reviewed, with four psychedelic compounds represented. Every study assessed components and subcomponents of divergent and convergent thinking, with only one instance of product assessment. Results suggest that convergent thinking may increase during the post-acute phases of the drugs' intake, fostering the capacity for development of previously generated ideas. However, this evidence may be circumstantial based on the low number of studies available, small sample sizes, overall lack of randomized controlled trials, and significant methodological limitations throughout most studies. Potential mechanisms underlying these effects are discussed, along with the current state of the research and implications for future studies."

Notably, prior studies have demonstrated that the glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine displays rapid‐acting and robust antidepressant effects, even in patients suffering from TRD. In the current study we endeavored to examine the effects of a combination of dextromethorphan (DM) and the CYP2D6 enzyme inhibitor quinidine (Q) in patients with TRD. Dextromethorphan modulates signaling at the NMDA receptor, in addition to other pharmacodynamics properties that include activity at sigma‐1 receptors and at the serotonin transporter. Quinidine inhibits the hepatic metabolism of DM, thereby increasing circulating concentrations of the latter. A combination product of DM 20 mg/Q 10 mg given every 12 hours is approved for the treatment of pseudobulbar affect (PBA). In the current study, we tested the safety, tolerability and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Methods: The current study consisted of an open‐label proof of concept (POC) clinical trial of DM/Q for up to 10 weeks in patients with unipolar TRD, either as monotherapy or as adjunctive therapy. Patients initiated study drug at 20/10 mg daily for 7 days, then increased to 20/10 mg every 12 hours for 7 days, then increased to a maximum dose of 45/10 mg every 12 hours if tolerated. The minimum required dose to remain in the study was 20/10 mg every 12 hours. Eligibility criteria included men and women between the ages of 18 and 65, a primary diagnosis of MDD as determined by the SCID, and a history of non‐response to two or more prior adequate antidepressant trials as determined by Antidepressant Treatment History Form (ATFH) criteria. Safety and tolerability outcomes were assessed by discontinuation rate, frequency of adverse events [using the Patient Rated Inventory of Side Effects (PRISE)], and score change on the Columbia‐Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C‐SSRS), the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale‐Positive Subscale (BPRS+), and the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS). Efficacy was assessed as change in MontgomeryAsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score. Additional efficacy and functional measures included the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology‐Self Report (QIDS‐SR), the Hamilton Anxiety Scale (HAM‐A), and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS). All analyses were conducted on the intention to treat (ITT) sample, with last observation carried forward for missing data. Results: Twenty patients with TRD (11 women; mean age: 49.4 ± 7.7 years) were started on DM/Q therapy and represent the ITT sample. Six patients discontinued prior to study completion, yielding a completer sample of 14 patients (70% retention). The most common adverse events were nausea and constipation, which each occurred in 3 patients. One serious adverse event occurred, representing hospitalization for insomnia and worsening depression three days after starting the study medication; this event was considered unlikely to be related to the study medication. There was no treatment‐emergent suicidal ideation or changes in BPRS+ or CADSS score. MADRS score was reduced from baseline to the 10‐week primary outcome (mean change: 12.95 ± 11.52, t(df = 19) = 5.04, po.001), as was QIDS‐SR score (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). The overall response rate was 45% (as defined by a 50% decrease in MADRS score from baseline to primary outcome). HAM‐A score was reduced from baseline to primary outcome (mean change: 5.70 ± 5.85, t(df = 19) = 4.36, po.001). Disability lessened from baseline to primary outcome as measured by the SDS (po.001). Conclusions: Herein we report acceptable tolerability and safety and preliminary efficacy of DM/Q up to 45/10 mg administered every 12 hours in patients with TRD. Future larger placebo controlled randomized trials in this population are warranted."
"7896","0","Psilocybin history, action and reaction: A narrative clinical review.^\nHallucinogenic mushrooms have been used in religious and cultural ceremonies for centuries. Of late, psilocybin, the psychoactive compound in hallucinogenic mushrooms, has received increased public interest as a novel drug for treating mood and substance use disorders (SUDs). In addition, in recent years, some states in the United States have legalized psilocybin for medical and recreational use. Given this, clinicians need to understand the potential benefits and risks related to using psilocybin for therapeutic purposes so that they can accurately advise patients. This expert narrative review summarizes the scientific basis and clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy for treating psychiatric disorders and SUDs. The results of this review are structured as a more extensive discussion about psilocybin's history, putative mechanisms of action, and recent legislative changes to its legal status. There is modest evidence of psilocybin-assisted therapy for treating depression and anxiety disorders. In addition, early data suggest that psilocybin-assisted therapy may effectively reduce harmful drinking in patients with alcohol use disorders. The evidence further suggests psilocybin, when administered under supervision (psilocybin-assisted therapy), the side effects experienced are mild and transient. The occurrence of severe adverse events following psilocybin administration is uncommon. Still, a recent clinical trial found that individuals in the psilocybin arm had increased suicidal ideations and non-suicidal self-injurious behaviors. Given this, further investigation into the safety and efficacy of psilocybin-assisted therapy is warranted to determine which patient subgroups are most likely to benefit and which are most likely to experience adverse outcomes related to its use."
"900","1","Slouching towards engagement: interactions between people using psychedelics naturalistically and their healthcare providers.^\nIntroduction: There is substantial public interest in psychedelics as potential treatments for psychiatric conditions. However, most psychedelics are criminalized under federal law in the USA, so it is unclear whether use occurs with clinical support. Our objective was to assess whether naturalistic psychedelic use occurs with clinical support, interactions between those using psychedelics and healthcare providers (psychiatrist, therapist, or primary physicians), and use characteristics. Methods: We conducted an online, anonymous, confidential, cross-sectional survey of adults reporting psychedelic use (N = 1221) through a psychedelics advocacy event and social media between 9/18/2022 and 11/5/2022. We assessed participant disclosure of psychedelic use with their psychiatric care provider (PsyCP) and/or primary care provider (PCP), desire for provider support, access to support, and rate of taking prescribed psychoactive medications alongside psychedelics. Results: Among participants with such care providers, 22% disclosed psychedelic use to their PCP vs. 58% to their PsyCP. Participants were less confident in PCP vs. PsyCP ability to integrate psychedelics into treatment. Common reasons for nondisclosure included stigma, inadequate provider knowledge, and legal concerns. 23% reported taking psychedelics on the same day as potentially interacting psychiatric medications (e.g., anxiolytics, antidepressants). Despite 81% of participants desiring therapist support during psychedelic experiences, only 15% had received such support. Discussion: Our results show that psychedelic use is generally disconnected from primary and psychiatric clinical care. This disconnection may result in safety issues, including inadequate screening for contraindicated conditions, lack of support during emergent adverse events, and drug interactions. Enhanced clinical education and orienting drug policy towards known harms and benefits of psychedelics is needed."

However, concurrent use of e-cigarettes with other tobacco products is not uncommon and may be associated with high-risk behaviors. We used data from 12,767 participants in the 2019 Youth Risk Behavior Survey to examine the patterns of tobacco product use among youth in the US. First, we examined the prevalence of e-cigarette-specific patterns of tobacco use (nonuse[no tobacco product use], sole use[sole e-cigarette use], dual-use[e-cigarette and one other tobacco product], and poly use[e-cigarette and two or more other tobacco products]). Then, using multivariable Poisson regression, we assessed how the tobacco use patterns were associated with the misuse of nine substances of abuse (alcohol, marijuana, cocaine, ecstasy, hallucinogens, heroin, inhalants, injectables, and methamphetamines). 62.9% of youth reported nonuse of any tobacco product. The weighted prevalence of sole e-cigarette use, dual use, and poly use was 23.2%, 4.2%, and 3.3%, respectively. Across all the substances explored, the prevalence was highest among poly users, followed by dual users, sole users, and non-users. Compared to non-users, sole, dual, and poly users had 7.8(95 %CI:6.1–10.0), 14.3(95 %CI:10.8–18.8), and 19.7(95 %CI:15.0–25.9) times higher adjusted prevalence of reporting past-30-day binge drinking, after adjusting for age, sex, race/ethnicity, sexual orientation, and depressive symptoms. This pattern was seen across all the different substances explored. These findings highlight the high prevalence of substance misuse among youth who use tobacco products and the need to educate and counsel on substances of abuse among this population, particularly among poly-tobacco users."

"3689","1","Intraoperative ketamine administration to prevent delirium or postoperative cognitive dysfunction: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Postoperative cognitive complications are associated with substantial morbidity and mortality. Ketamine has been suggested to have neuroprotective effects in various settings. This systematic review evaluates the effects of intraoperative ketamine administration on postoperative delirium and postoperative cognitive dysfunction (POCD). METHODS: Medline, Embase and Central were searched to 4 March 2018 without date or language restrictions. We considered randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing intraoperative ketamine administration versus no intervention in adults undergoing surgery under general anaesthesia. Primary outcomes were postoperative delirium and POCD. Non-cognitive adverse events, mortality and length of stay were considered as secondary outcomes. Data were independently extracted. The quality of the evidence (GRADE approach) was assessed following recommendations from the Cochrane collaboration. Risk ratios were calculated for binary outcomes, mean differences for continuous outcomes. We planned to explore the effects of age, specific anaesthesia regimen, depth of anaesthesia and intraoperative haemodynamic events through subgroup analyses. RESULTS: Six RCTs were included. The incidence of postoperative delirium did not differ between groups (4 trials, 557 patients, RR 0.83, 95% CI [0.25, 2.80]), but patients receiving ketamine seemed at lower risk of POCD (3 trials, 163 patients, RR 0.34, 95% CI [0.15, 0.73]). However, both analyses presented limitations. Therefore, the quality of the evidence (GRADE) was deemed low (postoperative delirium) and very low (POCD). CONCLUSION: The effect of ketamine on postoperative delirium remains unclear but its administration may offer some protection towards POCD. Large, well-designed randomised trials are urgently needed to further clarify the efficacy of ketamine on neurocognitive outcomes."

"3371","1","The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^\nExamined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"2549","0","Breakthrough for Trauma Treatment: Safety and Efficacy of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy Compared to Paroxetine and Sertraline.^\nUnsuccessfully treated posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a serious and life-threatening disorder. Two medications, paroxetine hydrochloride and sertraline hydrochloride, are approved treatments for PTSD by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Analyses of pharmacotherapies for PTSD found only small to moderate effects when compared with placebo. The Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies (MAPS) obtained Breakthrough Therapy Designation (BTD) from the FDA for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD on the basis of pooled analyses showing a large effect size for this treatment. This review covers data supporting BTD. In this treatment, MDMA is administered with psychotherapy in up to three monthly 8-h sessions. Participants are prepared for these sessions beforehand, and process material arising from the sessions in follow-up integrative psychotherapy sessions. Comparing data used for the approval of paroxetine and sertraline and pooled data from Phase 2 studies, MAPS demonstrated that MDMA-assisted psychotherapy constitutes a substantial improvement over available pharmacotherapies in terms of safety and efficacy. Studies of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy had lower dropout rates compared to sertraline and paroxetine trials. As MDMA is only administered under direct observation during a limited number of sessions, there is little chance of diversion, accidental or intentional overdose, or withdrawal symptoms upon discontinuation. BTD status has expedited the development of MAPS phase 3 trials occurring worldwide, leading up to a planned submission seeking FDA approval in 2021.

"8359","0","Assessment of Withdrawal, Mood, and Sleep Inventories After Monitored 3-Week Abstinence in Cannabis-Using Adolescents and Young Adults.^\nIntroduction: Among adolescents and young adults, cannabis use is prevalent. Prior studies characterizing withdrawal effects in this age range have primarily included treatment seeking or comorbid psychiatric samples; these studies have identified several affected domains, especially sleep, mood, and anxiety. The present study compared a community (i.e., nontreatment seeking) sample of cannabis-using and control participants on mood, anxiety, sleep, and withdrawal inventories during the course of a monitored 3-week cannabis abstinence period. Materials and Methods: Seventy-nine adolescent and young adult participants (cannabis-using group=37 and control group=42) were recruited from the community to undergo 3 weeks of confirmed abstinence (i.e., urine and sweat patch toxicology) and completion of Cannabis Withdrawal Symptom Criteria, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, Beck's Depression Inventory, and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index across the study period. Repeated measures and cross-sectional regressions were used to examine main effects of group and interactions with time (where appropriate), while accounting for recent alcohol use and cotinine levels. Results: Cannabis-using participants reported higher mood (p=0.006), overall withdrawal (p=0.009), and sleep-related withdrawal (p<0.001) symptoms across abstinence compared to controls. Overall withdrawal severity (p=0.04) and sleep-related withdrawal symptoms (p=0.02) demonstrated a quadratic trajectory across the monitored abstinence periods, with an increase from baseline and subsequent decreases in symptom severity. No differences of anxiety scores (p=0.07) or trajectories (p=0.18) were observed. By study completion, groups did not differ among sleep quality components (all p's>.05). Conclusions: These findings revealed that nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using adolescents and young adults reported heightened total withdrawal symptoms during a 3-week sustained abstinence period relative to controls. Cannabis-using participants demonstrated an increase in withdrawal symptom trajectory during the first week followed by decreased symptoms from weeks 2 to 3, which contrasts with prior linear decreases observed in cannabis-using adolescent and young adults. More mood symptoms were observed in the cannabis-using group even while excluding for comorbid psychopathologies-along with significantly more sleep problems during the abstinence period. Implications include the necessity to provide psychoeducation for recreational, nontreatment-seeking cannabis-using individuals about cannabis withdrawal, mood symptoms, and sleep quality difficulties when cannabis cessation is attempted, to improve likelihood of long-term sustained abstinence."

We set out to investigate the efficacy and safety of a rectal premedication regimen designed to produce this increased level of sedation. Sixty-seven children aged two to 24 months were randomised into two groups. Group MK received 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine and group MKK received 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine, 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine per rectum. The sedation score at the time of parental separation 30 minutes after drug administration and the response to intravenous cannulation were evaluated on a four-point scale. Respiratory rate, heart rate and arterial oxygen saturation were recorded immediately before parental separation. More patients in group MKK were asleep during separation (62 vs 35%, P < 0.05). Fewer patients in group MKK cried during intravenous cannulation (37 vs 68%, P < 0.05). Sedation scores were significantly increased at both time points. There was no difference between groups in vital signs at the time of parental separation and no adverse respiratory events occurred during the study period. In cases where a high degree of sedation following premedication in infants and toddlers is desired, the addition of 8 mg x kg(-1) ketamine to 0.5 mg x kg(-1) midazolam and 0.02 mg x kg(-1) atropine administered rectally is more efficacious than 4 mg x kg(-1) ketamine."

In the original article, there was an error in Figure 1 which shows the amine and aryl group moved one carbon over on the cyclohexanone structure whereas they should be next to the ketone. A corrected Figure 1 can be found in the NIHMS manuscript, but was too late for the journal publication. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2019-49924-018[/rid]). Ketamine shows promise as a rapidly-acting treatment for depression and suicidal ideation, but side effects and abuse potential limit its use. Understanding its mechanism of action could help develop analogous but safer drugs. This post hoc study explored relationships of ketamine and metabolites, including hydroxynorketamine enantiomers, (2S,6S)- and (2R,6R)-HNK, to clinical response in a subgroup from a published trial in suicidal depression. Depressed adults with clinically significant suicidal ideation were randomized to double-blind infusion of sub-anesthetic ketamine or midazolam. Ketamine and metabolites were measured after infusion (N = 53). Plasma (2R,6R)-HNK was associated with change (higher levels correlated with less clinical improvement) from baseline to 24 h post-infusion of depression (HDRS-24: Spearman r = 0.37, p = 0.009) and suicidal thoughts (SSI: Spearman r = 0.29, p = 0.041). There were similar correlations with weekly follow-up clinical rating scores for both HNK enantiomers and dehydronorketamine (DHNK). Ketamine and norketamine were not associated with change in depression or suicidal ideation (unadjusted p > 0.28). (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"9610","0","Analysis of Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy in Medicine: A Narrative Review.^\nPsilocybin-containing mushrooms have been consumed by various cultures in many different parts of the world for thousands of years. Psilocybin, a classic psychedelic, contains unique psychoactive properties and has been incorporated into religious ceremonies and investigated for its medicinal value. In the mid-20th century, psilocybin, along with most other classic psychedelics (5HT-2A agonists), was classified as a Schedule I substance, bringing a halt to research on its medicinal utility. The resurgence of clinical trials involving psilocybin in the 21st century has produced promising results concerning the treatment of addiction, depression, and end-of-life mood disorders. Results from these trials have shown significant reductions in depression and anxiety when compared with a placebo, and one trial found no significant difference when compared to a routinely prescribed selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI). Studies conducted with patients with advanced-stage cancer have demonstrated that psilocybin may also be beneficial at reducing depression and anxiety associated with psychological crises due to a terminal diagnosis. Psilocybin therapy in the treatment of addiction, which is notoriously difficult to treat, has shown encouraging results. Due to its low toxicity and low risk of overuse, psilocybin has the potential to have a significant influence in the field of addiction medicine. Psilocybin addiction research has been primarily focused on nicotine and alcohol and, in a few small, open-label trials, has shown superiority over traditional therapies. Psilocybin has a relatively unique and incompletely understood mechanism of action, which allows it to be given at several isolated periods. This infrequent dosing regimen has been shown to produce durable effects with minimal toxicity. This review analyzes the potential of psilocybin in the treatment of addiction, depression, and end-of-life mood disorders. In addition, it will discuss the difficulties involved with conducting scientific research on psychedelic compounds, adverse effects, and the therapeutic measures that are necessary to accompany the safe and effective administration of these psychoactive chemicals."
"8797","1","Pharmacodynamic Interactions Between Ketamine and Psychiatric Medications Used in the Treatment of Depression: A Systematic Review.^\nBackground The use of ketamine for depression has increased rapidly in the past decades. Ketamine is often prescribed as an add-on to other drugs used in psychiatric patients, but clear information on drug-drug interactions is lacking. With this review, we aim to provide an overview of the pharmacodynamic interactions between ketamine and mood stabilizers, benzodiazepines, monoamine oxidase-inhibitors, antipsychotics, and psychostimulants. Methods MEDLINE and Web of Science were searched. Results Twenty-four studies were included. For lithium, no significant interactions with ketamine were reported. Two out of 5 studies on lamotrigine indicated that the effects of ketamine were attenuated. Benzodiazepines were repeatedly shown to reduce the duration of ketamine's antidepressant effect. For the monoamine oxidase-inhibitor tranylcypromine, case reports showed no relevant changes in vital signs during concurrent S-ketamine use. One paper indicated an interaction between ketamine and haloperidol, 2 other studies did not. Four papers investigated risperidone, including 3 neuroimaging studies showing an attenuating effect of risperidone on ketamine-induced brain perfusion changes. Clozapine significantly blunted ketamine-induced positive symptoms in patients with schizophrenia but not in healthy participants. One paper reported no effect of olanzapine on ketamine's acute psychotomimetic effects. Conclusion Current literature shows that benzodiazepines and probably lamotrigine reduce ketamine's treatment outcome, which should be taken into account when considering ketamine treatment. There is evidence for an interaction between ketamine and clozapine, haloperidol, and risperidone. Due to small sample sizes, different subject groups and various outcome parameters, the evidence is of low quality. More studies are needed to provide insight into pharmacodynamic interactions with ketamine."

"603","1","Efficacy and safety of ketamine for the treatment of depressive symptoms in palliative care: A systematic review.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine has a fast onset of action that may offer a paradigm change for depression management at the end of life. We aimed to synthesize evidence regarding the safety and efficacy of ketamine in depression treatment within a broad palliative care concept. METHODS: We searched seven databases and included studies on the safety and efficacy of ketamine for depression treatment in patients diagnosed with any life-threatening disease. We also conducted a narrative review of the evidence. RESULTS: Among 2,252 screened titles and abstracts, we included 32 studies in our final synthesis: 14 case reports, two case series, two quasi-experimental studies, and seven randomized clinical trials (RCTs), as well as data from three unpublished clinical trials and seven cases from four larger case series. Most case reports reported a robust effect; however, the larger studies reported conflicting findings. Five RCTs reported positive outcomes; however, four of them were focused on a perioperative setting. Two negative studies did not primarily focus on depression and did not apply severity cutoffs. CONCLUSIONS: Although ketamine is generally safe and potentially useful, its efficacy in palliative care settings remains unclear. It may be a reasonable alternative for perioperative depression in oncological patients."
"690","1","Effects of GRIN2B , GRIA1 , and BDNF Polymorphisms on the Therapeutic Action of Ketamine and Esketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression Patients: Secondary Analysis From a Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: This study aimed to evaluate the effect of genetic variants in glutamate ionotropic receptor N-methyl- d -aspartate type subunit 2B ( GRIN2B ), glutamate ionotropic receptor α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid type subunit 1 ( GRIA1 ), and brain-derived neurotrophic factor ( BDNF ) genes on therapeutic response, remission, and total Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores after treatment with ketamine or esketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD) patients. METHODS: Participants (N = 60) are from a double-blind, randomized, noninferiority clinical trial comparing single-dose intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) to esketamine (0.25 mg/kg) for TRD. Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale was applied at baseline, 24 hours, 72 hours, and 7 days postinfusion to assess depressive symptoms. Blood samples were collected to evaluate single nucleotide polymorphisms rs1805502 ( GRIN2B ), rs1994862 ( GRIA1 ), and rs6265 ( BDNF ). RESULTS: There was no association between rs1805502, rs1994862, or rs6265 polymorphisms and antidepressant response ( P = 0.909, P = 0.776, and P = 0.482, respectively), remission P = 0.790, P = 0.086, and P = 0.669), or Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores at each time point ( P = 0.907, P = 0.552, and P = 0.778). CONCLUSIONS: We found no association between the studied single nucleotide polymorphisms (rs6265, rs1805502, and rs1994862) and ketamine's therapeutic action in TRD patients. Further studies with larger samples are needed to clarify the utility of these genes of interest as predictors for antidepressant treatment."

Whether it has the same effect on infants remains unclear. We recruited infants who were scheduled for 1 to 3 outpatient laser surgery treatments of benign facial growths with ketamine anesthesia. Patients were assigned to the Ket₁, Ket₂, or Ket₃ group, according to the number of treatments. The Bayley Scales of Infant Development–Second Edition (BSID-II) was used to assess neurodevelopmental outcomes before the first and after the last therapy. Levels of S-100β were also measured. Bayley Scales of Infant Development–Second Edition scores after the last procedure were lower than those before the first surgery in the Ket3 group (P < .05). S-100β levels after the last procedure were significantly higher than those before the first surgery in all groups (P < .05). Our results suggest that 3 or more exposures to anesthetic ketamine have the potential to adversely affect neurodevelopment in infants. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"6753","0","Ecstasy (MDMA) mimics the post-orgasmic state: impairment of sexual drive and function during acute MDMA-effects may be due to increased prolactin secretion.^\nMethylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""Ecstasy"") is a major stimulant drug of abuse worldwide. MDMA produces euphoria, enhances interpersonal communication and feelings of closeness with others. In contrast to the induced emotions of affection and sensual enhancement, clinical studies show that it impairs sexual drive and functioning. In drug-free humans, sexual stimulation with orgasm induces a pronounced secretion of prolactin, which may mediate the post-orgasmic state. The phenomenological features of the psychological state induced by MDMA show some similarities with features of the post-orgasmic state. In addition, MDMA also induces a prominent increase of prolactin plasma levels with a similar time kinetic compared to the post-orgasmic prolactin increase. Here, we present the hypothesis that the impairment of sexual parameters after MDMA may be mediated by increased prolactin."
"3148","1","Acute Experiences During Infusions Cause Extra-Pharmacological Antidepressant Effects in Ketamine Treatment: evidence From Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Trials.^\nBackground: Studies of rapid‐acting, psychoactive antidepressants like serotonergic‐psychedelics report that qualities like anxiety and positive‐affect during psychoactive experiences mediate clinical response. However, whether such non‐dissociative experiences are related to antidepressant responses following sub‐anesthetic infusions of the glutamate‐modulator ketamine has been minimally investigated using proper controls and sample‐sizes. Using 86 participants with treatment‐resistant unipolar or bipolar depression enrolled in double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover ketamine trials, we tested the hypothesis that self‐reported euphoria, fear or anxiety during ketamine’s psychoactive period mediates antidepressant response. We predicted that greater euphoria and lower anxiety and fear would predict reduced depressive symptom‐severity one (D1) and seven (D7) days following infusion. Methods: We administered a standard adverse events (AE) questionnaire (scored from zero‐three) that included “euphoria,” “fearful,” and “anxiety” items measured immediately after 40‐minute infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and saline. Our primary outcome was the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We used drug*AE‐interactions from mixed models to test mediation hypotheses. Covariates included diagnosis and baseline MADRS. Results: We did not detect any drug*AE interactions associated with D1 MADRS‐scores. While greater anxiety was associated with higher D1 MADRS for ketamine and placebo, (p= 0.007), main effects of fear (p=0.062) and euphoria (p=0.059) were weaker. We did not detect D7 interactions or main effects. Conclusions: Our results do not support a role for peri‐infusion, psychoactive experiences in ketamine’s antidepressant mechanism. Short‐lasting associations between experiences and response observed with ketamine and placebo is consistent with extra‐pharmacological effects. Further research is warranted since this analysis is post‐hoc and had limited measures of psychoactive experiences.

"3427","1","Investigation of serotonin-1A receptor function in the human psychopharmacology of MDMA.^\nSerotonin (5-HT) release is the primary pharmacological mechanism of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') action in the primate brain. Dopamine release and direct stimulation of dopamine D2 and serotonin 5-HT2A receptors also contributes to the overall action of MDMA. The role of 5-HT1A receptors in the human psychopharmacology of MDMA, however, has not yet been elucidated. In order to reveal the consequences of manipulation at the 5-HT1A receptor system on cognitive and subjective effects of MDMA, a receptor blocking study using the mixed beta-adrenoreceptor blocker/5-HT1A antagonist pindolol was performed. Using a double-blind, placebo-controlled within-subject design, 15 healthy male subjects were examined under placebo (PL), 20 mg pindolol (PIN), MDMA (1.6 mg/kg b.wt.), MDMA following pre-treatment with pindolol (PIN-MDMA). Tasks from the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery were used for the assessment of cognitive performance. Psychometric questionnaires were applied to measure effects of treatment on core dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness, mood and state anxiety. Compared with PL, MDMA significantly impaired sustained attention and visual-spatial memory, but did not affect executive functions. Pre-treatment with PIN did not significantly alter MDMA-induced impairment of cognitive performance and only exerted a minor modulating effect on two psychometric scales affected by MDMA treatment ('positive derealization' and 'dreaminess'). Our findings suggest that MDMA differentially affects higher cognitive functions, but does not support the hypothesis from animal studies, that some of the MDMA effects are causally mediated through action at the 5-HT1A receptor system."

"8881","0","The long-term effects of single and repeated subanaesthetic ketamine administration on regional cerebral blood flow in healthy dogs measured with <SUP>99m</SUP>Tc-HMPAO SPECT.^\nSubanaesthetic ketamine has recently been established as an effective and rapid treatment for major depressive disorder showing antidepressant effects for up to 1 week on average. The use of repeated ketamine infusions has been put forward to augment and to prolong the antidepressant response and increase the remission rates. The underlying neurobiological mechanisms responsible for ketamine's antidepressant effects remain unclear. Nevertheless, it has been shown, both in dogs and humans, that ketamine can alter neuronal perfusion and therefore neuronal function in brain regions involved in psychiatric and behavioural disorders. Consequently, the aim of the current placebo controlled study was to assess the long-term effects on cerebral perfusion of single and repeated subanaesthetic ketamine infusions in dogs. Twelve healthy, laboratory dogs were scanned at six different time points following single and repeated ketamine administration, using Single Photon Emission Computed Tomography with the radiotracer Tc-99m-hexamethylpropylene amine oxime. We hypothesised that repeated infusions could lead to more prolonged perfusion alterations in brain regions critical for behaviour regulation. We found that repeated subanaesthetic ketamine administration did not result in more prolonged cerebral perfusion alterations compared to a single ketamine administration."

In this study, the combined acute effects of MDMA and cocaine were examined by conducting in vivo microdialysis in the rat nucleus accumbens while simultaneously monitoring locomotor activity. Male Sprague-Dawley rats were administered cocaine (10 or 20 mg/kg, i.p.), MDMA (1.5 or 3.0 mg/kg, i.p.), or one of four combinations of cocaine and MDMA during microdialysis experiments. Locomotor activity was monitored, and dialysis samples were collected every 30 min for 3 h prior to injections, for one 30-min period following saline injections, and for an additional 3-h period following drug injections. Samples were analyzed for dopamine content by high-performance liquid chromatography with electrochemical detection. Significant differences in locomotor activity and dopamine efflux were found among treatment groups, with some MDMA/cocaine combinations producing significantly greater increases compared to single doses of cocaine or MDMA within the first 30 min after injection. Considering the popularity of polysubstance use among recreational MDMA users, the clinical implications of the current findings warrant further investigation."

The former is a naturally occurring psychedelic. The latter was invented in the laboratory exactly 60 years ago. Although the substances were controversial in the past, recent studies indicate the potential of those substances as novel antidepressant agents. The PubMed/MEDLINE database was used to identify articles for systematic review, using the following search terms: (depression) AND (psilocybin) OR (ketamine). From 617 items, only 12 articles were obtained in the final analyses. Three articles were devoted to psilocybin in depression treatment and nine to esketamine. In most studies, esketamine showed a significant reduction in both depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation shortly after intake and after a month of treatment compared to baseline and to standard-of-care antidepressant agents. Psilocybin’s antidepressive effects occurred one day after intake and after 6–7 weeks of treatment and were maintained for up to 6 or 8 months of follow-up. One study indicated that psilocybin’s effects are comparable with and may be superior to escitalopram treatment. Both esketamine and psilocybin demonstrated rapid and long-term effects in reducing depression symptoms and, after overcoming some limitations, may be considered as novel antidepressant agents in future."
"1437","1","Cognitive function of patients with treatment-resistant depression after a single low dose of ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function."

Additional research is needed to determine successful interventions to improve adherence to a LSD and health outcomes. Purpose: To determine the effect of an education intervention on adherence to a LSD and health outcomes. Method: A total of 109 HF patients (age 64±9 years, 29% female) who were non‐adherent to LSD, indicating > 3g of 24‐hour urinary sodium excretion (24hr UNa) at baseline, were randomly assigned to one of 3 groups: 1) symptom monitoring and restricted 3 gram sodium diet (SMART) group, 2) the telephone monitoring (TM) group, or 3) usual care control group. The SMART group received individualized teaching and guidance of self‐monitoring for worsening symptom and sodium intake using symptom and food diary for 4 sessions over 8 weeks. Patients assigned to either of the 2 intervention groups (SMART or TM) received phone calls every 2 weeks over 8 weeks. At 6 months follow‐up, adherence to a LSD was assessed using 24hr UNa. Patients were followed for 1 year to determine time to first event of hospitalization or death due to cardiac problems. Repeated measures ANOVA and Cox regression were used to determine the effect of intervention. Results: The SMART group (n=37) showed a significant reduction in sodium intake across time compared to the TM group (n=35) and control group (n=37) (p= .022). In the Cox regression, patients in the SMART group had longer cardiac event‐free survival compared to the control group after controlling for age, gender, ejection fraction, angiotensin‐converting enzyme inhibitor use, and better blocker use (p=.008). Conclusion: An education intervention focused on self‐monitoring for symptom and sodium intake improved adherence to LSD and health outcomes in patients with HF. Helping patients engage in self‐monitoring for symptom and sodium intake by themselves can promote better health outcome."
"2912","1","Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents."

"7386","1","Estimated lifetime drug use, impulsivity, and psychopathology in recreational ecstasy users.^\nPrevious research suggests elevated levels of impulsivity and psychopathology in recreational ecstasy users. However, most recreational ecstasy users tend to be poly-drug users. The present study aimed to investigate impulsivity and psychopathology in a sample of recreational ecstasy polydrug users compared with samples of non-ecstasy users, while statistically controlling for estimated life-time drug usage. Sixty-eight non-drug controls, 79 non-ecstasy poly-drug users, 11 'light' ecstasy poly-drug users, and 47 'heavy' ecstasy poly drug users completed the Barratt Impulsivity Scale (BIS-11) and the SCL-90R and a drug history questionnaire. When estimated life-time drug-use was statistically controlled for, heavy ecstasy users exhibited significantly higher levels of non-planning and cognitive impulsivity, and increased obsessive compulsion, anxiety and positive symptom total than non-ecstasy users. This study provides evidence of some elements of elevated impulsivity and psychopathology in heavy ecstasy users, but not in lighter ecstasy users. The results should be seen in the context of the heavy ecstasy group as poly-drug users and should be interpreted with caution. © 2010 Informa UK, Ltd."
"5834","1","[Ketamine administration in case of severe, therapy resistant depressed patient, case report].^\nObjective - In our case report we present the treatment of a female patient suffering from therapy resistant depression. This procedure is not in practice in Hungary at present, the aim of our work to reproduce the findigs of international studies in domestic circumstances. Matter - Major depression is a common, chronic and severe mental disorder, with 16.2% lifetime prevalence. Many international randomized, placebo controlled trials found administration of ketamine infusion effective in depressed patients. Methods - Since ketamine is an anesthetic agent, its administration was performed in the post-operative monitoring room of our hospital operating-room, supervised by an anesthesiologist. According to formerly published data, a dose of 0.5 mg/kg of body weight was administered intravenously in 40 minutes by perfusor. The drug was administered in a same manner fifteen days later. Subject - The patient was admitted to our inpatient ward with severe depression. During two months of combined antidepressant therapy her condition has not improved significantly. Approval for off label drug indication was granted with urgency by the National Institute of Quality and Organizational Development in Healthcare and Medicines. Results - During the two treatments the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale 21 items rating scale score was reduced to 8 from the baseline 28, the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale score was reduced to 6 from 25, Beck Depression Inventory was reduced to 9 from 20. Upon administration of the drug no severe adverse event was detected, the mild dissociative state related to ketamine was ceased in a short period of time. Discussion - With administration of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine the authors managed to achieve rapid improvement in a therapy resistant depressed patient, without permanent side effects. Our future plan is to repeat the use of the drug within a double-blind, placebo controlled trial in order to prove its efficacy in hospital settings."
"422","1","Psychedelic use is associated with reduced daily opioid use among people who use illicit drugs in a Canadian setting.^\nBACKGROUND: Research into the therapeutic and naturalistic uses of psychedelics for improving outcomes related to mental health disorders has generated increasing interest in recent years. While controlled clinical trials of psychedelics have signaled benefits for treating substance use disorders, this area has not been well studied in the context of naturalistic psychedelic use. This study sought to investigate the possible relationship between recent naturalistic psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use among people who use drugs (PWUD). METHODS: Data (2006-2018) were drawn from three harmonized prospective cohorts of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver, Canada. We used multivariable generalized linear mixed-effects modeling (GLMM) to estimate the independent association between psychedelic use and subsequent daily illicit opioid use. RESULTS: Among 3813 PWUD at baseline, 1093 (29%) reported daily use of illicit opioids and 229 (6%) reported psychedelic use in the past six months. Over study follow-up after adjusting for a range of potential confounders, psychedelic use remained independently associated with a significantly reduced odds of subsequent daily opioid use (Adjusted Odds Ratio: 0.45; 95% Confidence Interval: 0.29 to 0.70). CONCLUSION: While confirmation in other settings is required, these findings align with growing evidence that psychedelic use may be associated with detectable reductions in subsequent substance use including illicit opioid use."
"6665","1","MDMA and memory, addiction, and depression: dose-effect analysis.^\nRationale +/- 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a recreational drug that shows substantial promise as a psychotherapeutic agent. Still, there is some concern regarding its behavioral toxicity, and its dose-effect relationship is poorly understood. We previously explored the role of dose in the cognitive effects of MDMA in a systematic review of existing literature and found no evidence in animals that MDMA impairs memory at low doses (< 3 mg/kg) but mixed results at high doses (>= 3 mg/kg). Since this review comprised mostly of single-dose studies and an assortment of methodologies, an empirical dose-ranging study on this topic is warranted. Objectives The current study aims to evaluate the conclusion from our systematic review that 3 mg/kg may be the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia, and to further understand the dose-effect relationship of MDMA on behavioral assays of memory, addiction, and depression. Methods We systematically examined the effects of 0.01 to 10 mg/kg MDMA on Pavlovian fear conditioning; behavioral sensitization, conditioned place preference, and conditioned responding; and the Porsolt forced swim test in mice. Results High doses of MDMA (>= 3 mg/kg) produced amnesia of fear conditioning memory, some evidence of an addictive potential, and antidepressant effects, while low doses of MDMA (<= 1 mg/kg) had no effect on these behaviors. Conclusions The present dose-ranging study provides further evidence that 3 mg/kg is the threshold for MDMA-induced amnesia. These findings, in addition to our systematic review, demonstrate that careful selection of MDMA dose is critical. High doses (>= 3 mg/kg) should likely be avoided due to evidence that they can produce amnesia and addiction. Conversely, there is little evidence to suggest that low doses, which are usually administered in clinical studies (approximately 1-2 mg/kg), will lead to these same adverse effects. Ultra-low doses (< 1 mg/kg) are likely even safer and should be investigated for therapeutic effects in future studies."
"8819","0","MDMA-induced impairment in primates: Antagonism by a selective norepinephrine or serotonin, but not by a dopamine/norepinephrine transport inhibitor.^\nHuman MDMA (R,S-3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) users display selective cognitive deficits after acute MDMA exposure, frequently attributed to serotonin deficits. We postulated that MDMA will compromize executive function in primates and that an inhibitor of the serotonin transporter (SERT) and the norepinephrine transporter (NET) but not the dopamine (DAT) transporter, will prevent impairment. The potencies of DAT/NET, NET and SERT inhibitors to block transport of [3H]MDMA and [3H]monoamines were compared in vitro. Subsequently, cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fasicularis) were trained to stable performance in a reversal learning task. Effects of once-weekly oral or i.m. dose of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg, n = 4) on performance were monitored, alone or after pretreatment with inhibitors of the SERT, DAT or NET (prior to i.m. MDMA). 1) Drug potencies for blocking [3H]MDMA or [3H]monoamine transport were not consistent; 2) Oral MDMA increased error rates in a cognitive task for up to three days following exposure, whereas intramuscular MDMA prevented subjects from performing the cognitive task on the day of administration, but not on subsequent days; 3) The SERT inhibitor citalopram and the NET inhibitor desipramine, but not the DAT/NET inhibitor methylphenidate, reversed the effects of MDMA on task performance and mandibular movements induced by i.m. MDMA and 4) MDMA altered sleep latency. Oral MDMA impairs executive function in monkeys for several days, a finding of potential relevance to MDMA consumption by humans. Reversal of impaired executive function by a NET inhibitor implicates the NET and norepinephrine in MDMA-induced cognitive impairment and may be relevant to therapeutic strategies. © 2008 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"7058","1","The Fabric of Meaning and Subjective Effects in LSD-Induced States Depend on Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nA core aspect of the human self is the attribution of personal relevance to everyday stimuli enabling us to experience our environment as meaningful [1]. However, abnormalities in the attribution of personal relevance to sensory experiences are also critical features of many psychiatric disorders [2, 3]. Despite their clinical relevance, the neurochemical and anatomical substrates enabling meaningful experiences are largely unknown. Therefore, we investigated the neuropharmacology of personal relevance processing in humans by combining fMRI and the administration of the mixed serotonin (5-HT) and dopamine receptor (R) agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), well known to alter the subjective meaning of percepts, with and without pretreatment with the 5-HT(2A)R antagonist ketanserin. General subjective LSD effects were fully blocked by ketanserin. In addition, ketanserin inhibited the LSD-induced attribution of personal relevance to previously meaningless stimuli and modulated the processing of meaningful stimuli in cortical midline structures. These findings point to the crucial role of the 5-HT(2A)R subtype and cortical midline regions in the generation and attribution of personal relevance. Our results thus increase our mechanistic understanding of personal relevance processing and reveal potential targets for the treatment of psychiatric illnesses characterized by alterations in personal relevance attribution."
"9579","1","Acute effects of ketamine and esketamine on cognition in healthy subjects: A meta-analysis.^\nBACKGROUND: Impairment in cognition is frequently associated with acute ketamine administration. However, some questions remain unanswered as to which deficits are most prominent and what variables modulate these effects. METHODS: A literature search yielded 56 experimental studies of acute ketamine administration that assessed cognition in 1041 healthy volunteers. A multivariate meta-analysis was performed, and effect sizes were estimated for eleven cognitive domains: attention, executive function, response inhibition, social cognition, speed of processing, verbal / language, verbal learning, verbal memory, visual learning & memory, visuospatial abilities, and working memory. RESULTS: There were small-to-moderate impairments across all cognitive domains. Deficits in verbal learning / memory were most prominent, whereas response inhibition was the least affected. Meta-regression analysis revealed that the negative effects of ketamine on cognition are dependent on infusion dose and plasma level, but unaffected by enantiomer type, route of administration, sex or age. A publication bias was observed. DISCUSSION: Acute ketamine broadly impairs cognition across all domains among healthy individuals. Verbal learning and memory figures most prominently in cognitive impairment elicited by acute ketamine administration."
"5494","1","A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trials of ketamine in the rapid treatment of major depressive episodes.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing interest in glutamatergic agents in depression, particularly ketamine, a glutamate N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. We aimed to assess the efficacy of ketamine in major depressive episodes. METHOD: We searched EMBASE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and Medline from 1962 to January 2014 to identify double-blind, randomized controlled trials with allocation concealment evaluating ketamine in major depressive episodes. Clinical remission, response and depressive symptoms were extracted by two independent raters. The primary outcome measure was clinical remission at 24 h, 3 days and 7 days post-treatment. Analyses employed a random-effects model. RESULTS: Data were synthesized from seven RCTs employing an intravenous infusion and one RCT employing intranasal ketamine, representing 73 subjects in parallel arms and 110 subjects in cross-over designs [n = 34 with bipolar disorder (BD), n = 149 with major depressive disorder (MDD)]. Ketamine was associated with higher rates of clinical remission relative to comparator (saline or midazolam) at 24 h [OR 7.06, number needed to treat (NNT) = 5], 3 days (OR 3.86, NNT = 6), and 7 days (OR 4.00, NNT = 6), as well as higher rates of clinical response at 24 h (OR 9.10, NNT = 3), 3 days (OR 6.77, NNT = 3), and 7 days (OR 4.87, NNT = 4). A standardized mean difference of 0.90 in favor of ketamine was observed at 24 h based on depression rating scale scores, with group comparisons revealing greater efficacy in unipolar depression compared to bipolar depression (1.07 v. 0.68). Ketamine was associated with transient psychotomimetic effects, but no persistent psychosis or affective switches. CONCLUSION: Our meta-analysis suggests that single administrations ketamine are efficacious in the rapid treatment of unipolar and bipolar depression. Additional research is required to determine optimal dosing schedules, route, treatment schedules, and the potential efficacy of other glutamatergic agents."
"2094","1","The drug purity discounting task: Ecstasy use likelihood is reduced by probabilistic impurity according to harmfulness of adulterants.^\nBACKGROUND: Ecstasy typically contains adulterants in addition to, or in lieu of, MDMA which may pose a greater risk to users than MDMA itself. The current study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of adulterant-related informational prompts in reducing Ecstasy use using a novel probability discounting task. METHODS: An online sample of past-month Ecstasy users (N = 278) were randomized to one of four different framing prompt conditions: no prompt; a prompt describing MDMA's effects; a prompt describing adulterants as inert ""filler""; or a prompt describing adulterants as pharmacologically-active, potentially-harmful compounds. Each prompt contained general, potential public-health information that was not specifically related to subsequent behavioral tasks. All participants then completed an identical Drug Purity Discounting Task, in which they indicated the likelihood of using a sample of Ecstasy across different probabilities of the sample being impure, and then completed a hypothetical Ecstasy purchasing task. RESULTS: Likelihood of Ecstasy use decreased as impurity probability increased across conditions. Ecstasy use likelihood was highest in the ""inert"" prompt condition, whereas pharmacologically-active adulterant or adulterant-nonspecific prompts resulted in comparably low likelihood of use. Ecstasy-use likelihood did not differ among conditions when the likelihood of sample impurity was 0. Ecstasy purchasing did not differ among groups. Inelastic purchasing was associated with greater likelihood of using potentially-impure Ecstasy. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, these data highlight the necessity of education regarding pharmacologically-active, rather than inert, adulterants in Ecstasy, and suggest that increased access to drug checking kits and services may mitigate some of the harms associated with Ecstasy use."
"988","1","Acute effects of ayahuasca on neuropsychological performance: differences in executive function between experienced and occasional users.^\nBACKGROUND: Ayahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea containing the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine, has been shown to increase regional cerebral blood flow in prefrontal brain regions after acute administration to humans. Despite interactions at this level, neuropsychological studies have not found cognitive deficits in abstinent long-term users. OBJECTIVES: Here, we wished to investigate the effects of acute ayahuasca intake on neuropsychological performance, specifically on working memory and executive function. METHODS: Twenty-four ayahuasca users (11 long-term experienced users and 13 occasional users) were assessed in their habitual setting using the Stroop, Sternberg, and Tower of London tasks prior to and following ayahuasca intake. RESULTS: Errors in the Sternberg task increased, whereas reaction times in the Stroop task decreased and accuracy was maintained for the whole sample following ayahuasca intake. Interestingly, results in the Tower of London showed significantly increased execution and resolution times and number of movements for the occasional but not the experienced users. Additionally, a correlation analysis including all subjects showed that impaired performance in the Tower of London was inversely correlated with lifetime ayahuasca use. CONCLUSIONS: Acute ayahuasca administration impaired working memory but decreased stimulus-response interference. Interestingly, detrimental effects on higher cognition were only observed in the less experienced group. Rather than leading to increased impairment, greater prior exposure to ayahuasca was associated with reduced incapacitation. Compensatory or neuromodulatory effects associated with long-term ayahuasca intake could underlie preserved executive function in experienced users."
"7735","1","The effects of ketamine and risperidone on eye movement control in healthy volunteers.^\nThe non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine leads to transient psychosis-like symptoms and impairments in oculomotor performance in healthy volunteers. This study examined whether the adverse effects of ketamine on oculomotor performance can be reversed by the atypical antipsychotic risperidone. In this randomized double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 72 healthy participants performed smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM), prosaccades (PS) and antisaccades (AS) while being randomly assigned to one of four drug groups (intravenous 100 ng ml(-1) ketamine, 2 mg oral risperidone, 100  ng ml(-1) ketamine plus 2 mg oral risperidone, placebo). Drug administration did not lead to harmful adverse events. Ketamine increased saccadic frequency and decreased velocity gain of SPEM (all P < 0.01) but had no significant effects on PS or AS (all P > or = 0.07). An effect of risperidone was observed for amplitude gain and peak velocity of PS and AS, indicating hypometric gain and slower velocities compared with placebo (both P < or = 0.04). No ketamine by risperidone interactions were found (all P > or = 0.26). The results confirm that the administration of ketamine produces oculomotor performance deficits similar in part to those seen in schizophrenia. The atypical antipsychotic risperidone did not reverse ketamine-induced deteriorations. These findings do not support the cognitive enhancing potential of risperidone on oculomotor biomarkers in this model system of schizophrenia and point towards the importance of developing alternative performance-enhancing compounds to optimise pharmacological treatment of schizophrenia."
"641","1","Psilocybin in long-term meditators: effects on default mode network functional connectivity and retrospective ratings of qualitative experience.^\nAims: Descriptions of meditation experiences can bear striking similarity to descriptions of some experiences with classic (serotonergic) hallucinogens. Neuroimaging studies reveal striking overlap in the effects of psilocybin and the effects of meditation on functional connectivity of the default mode network (DMN). This ongoing study explored the effects of psilocybin on subjective experience and DMN connectivity in long‐term meditators. Methods: 16 meditators (mean lifetime meditation = 4206 h) received either a placebo (n = 8) or a high dose psilocybin (n = 8) capsule before a laboratory session. Retrospective self‐report measures of subjective experience and resting‐state fMRI data were collected the day after the session. Seed‐based functional connectivity analyses were applied to fMRI data. Self‐report measures and functional connectivity of the DMN were compared between placebo and psilocybin groups. Results: Participants who received psilocybin attributed significantly greater meaning, spiritual significance, psychological challenge, and psychological insight to their session experiences than those who received placebo. 75% of participants in the psilocybin group rated the experience to be in the top 10 most meaningful experiences of their life. Participants who received psilocybin also showed lower functional connectivity between hippocampal and posterior DMN regions and greater functional connectivity among DMN regions than those who received placebo. Conclusions: Participants attributed substantial meaning to their high‐dose psilocybin experience, andshowedchanges in brain function the day after a high dose of psilocybin. Further research should explore the relationship of these enduring changes in brain function to abuse liability and therapeutic outcomes with psilocybin."
"822","0","Importance of Exploring N-Methyl-D-Aspartate (NMDA) as a Future Perspective Target in Depression.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a serious and complex mental illness. Currently, many antidepressants are available in the market for the treatment of MDD. However, these agents are associated with side effects, which restricts their use. This warrants the development of advanced anti-depressive medications with a novel mechanism of action or novel targets and with minimal adverse effects. The traditional neurobiological hypothesis of depression, the monoamine hypothesis, is unable to properly explain all the aspects of depressive conditions. In this review, we discuss novel approaches that could be used for the treatment of depression, including glutamatergic and serotonergic system modulation. The pathogenesis of depression is greatly affected by glutamatergic neurotransmission dysfunction. Previous investigations have shown that ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, exerts fast and long-lasting antidepressant effects. Several glutamatergic modulators, such as esketamine, sarcosine, and others, have also shown potential antidepressant action in animal as well as clinical studies. Lastly, drugs that alter neurotransmission by NMDA receptors could open up new avenues for more effective treatment of depression. Besides, understanding the underlying mechanisms will aid in the development of novel and fast-acting antidepressant drugs in the future."

In their study, Ranganathan et al. explored the psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, neuroendocrine effects, and quantitative electroencephalographic (EEG) effects resulting from the controlled administration of Salvinorin A (SA) to humans. This study provides the first comprehensive evaluation of the effects of SA in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover, counterbalanced study in healthy humans. To perform this study, Ranganathan et al. recruited 10 psychiatrically and medically healthy subjects who had previous experience with SA and, in some cases, other psychoactive medications. Consistent with anecdotal reports, the subjects experienced a rapid, short-lasting, and intense psychoactive effect of SA. To gain a better understanding of the endocrine effects of SA, the authors measured the cortisol and prolactin serum levels after SA administration. Resting EEG power is sensitive to drug-induced changes in consciousness and may be altered in psychosis. The authors reported that both doses of SA decreased resting-state EEG spectral power compared with the placebo. The authors did not comment on any sex differences in SA effects. The authors noted that the effects of SA make it unlikely to cause addiction, which is likely a result of KOR agonists’ aversive effects. Most importantly, this study extends our knowledge of drug-induced psychotomimesis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2018 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8507","0","Current Perspective on MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for Posttraumatic Stress Disorder.^\nThe present paper discusses the current literature with regard to substance-assisted psychotherapy with Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The aim of the paper is to give a comprehensive overview of the development from MDMA's early application in psychotherapy to its present and future role in the treatment of PTSD. It is further attempted to increase the attention for MDMA's therapeutic potential by providing a thorough depiction of the scientific evidence regarding its theorized mechanism of action and potential harms of its application in the clinical setting (e.g., misattribution of therapeutic gains to medication instead of psychological changes). Empirical support for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, including the randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trails that have been conducted since 2008, is discussed. Thus far, an overall remission rate of 66.2% and low rates of adverse effects have been found in the six phase two trials conducted in clinical settings with 105 blinded subjects with chronic PTSD. The results seem to support MDMA's safe and effective use as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Even though preliminary studies may look promising, more studies of its application in a psychotherapeutic context are needed in order to establish MDMA as a potential adjunct to therapy."

MDMA (20 mg/kg) significantly increased the extracellular concentration of DA in the striatum of both ADX and SHAM animals. There was no significant difference between the ADX and SHAM animals with respect to MDMA-induced increase in DA concentrations. The time-course effect of MDMA on the concentrations of serotonin (5-HT) and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA) also was examined in forebrain regions of ADX and SHAM animals. MDMA (20 mg/kg) significantly decreased the concentrations of 5-HT and 5-HIAA in the hypothalamus, frontal cortex, hippocampus and striatum 3 hr and 7 days following administration of MDMA (20 mg/kg). With the exception of the frontal cortex, there was no significant difference between ADX and SHAM animals with respect to the acute (3 and 24 hr) and long-term (7 day) depletion of 5-HT and 5-HIAA content produced by the administration of MDMA. These data are suggestive that ADX has no effect on MDMA-induced release of DA in the striatum and minimal protective effect of the 5-HT neurotoxicity produced by the administration of MDMA. Thus, corticosterone does not play a significant role in MDMA-induced 5-HT and 5-HIAA depletion."
"1846","1","Self-reported psychopathological symptoms in recreational ecstasy (MDMA) are mainly associated with regular cannabis use: Further evidence from a combined cross-sectional/longitudinal investigation.^\nRationale: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) has become a widely used recreational drug among young people. This is of great concern, since MDMA is neurotoxic in animal studies and its use has been associated with psychological distress and a variety of self-reported psychiatric symptoms. However, exploring the origins of psychopathology in ecstasy users is hampered by the frequent polydrug use and by the cross-sectional design of all investigations, so far. Objectives: The present study combines a cross-sectional with a longitudinal approach to further clarify the impact of the use of other illicit drugs on psychopathological symptoms reported by ecstasy users. Methods: At baseline, we administered self-rating scales for impulsivity, sensation seeking and general psychological complaints to 60 recreational ecstasy users and 30 matched controls. From the initial sample of ecstasy users, 38 subjects were reexamined 18 months later. Results: At baseline, ecstasy users reported significantly more psychological complaints than controls. However, self-reported psychopathology was mainly associated with regular cannabis use. At follow-up, subjects who had abstained from ecstasy use during the follow-up period did not differ from those reporting continued consumption. In contrast, subjects with regular concomitant cannabis use during the follow-up period reported more anxiety, interpersonal sensitivity and obsessive-compulsive behaviour than cannabis-abstinent users. Finally, higher levels of obsessive-compulsive behaviour, interpersonal sensitivity, depression, anxiety, phobic anxiety and paranoid ideation were significantly correlated with the duration of regular interim cannabis use. Conclusions: The present findings suggest that self-reported psychopathology in ecstasy users is predominantly attributable to concomitant use of cannabis. Abstinence from cannabis and not ecstasy seems to be a reliable predictor for remission of psychological complaints in ecstasy users. © Springer-Verlag 2004."
"4122","0","Donepezil in a chronic drug user--a potential treatment?.^\nThe objective of the current study was to explore the potential cognitive benefits of an anticholinesterase inhibitor, donepezil, in a former chronic drug user. A neuropsychological test battery composed of the vocabulary and matrix reasoning subtests of the Wechsler adult intelligence scale-III, measures of everyday executive functioning (behavioural assessment of the dysexecutive syndrome [BADS]), and verbal learning and memory tasks (California verbal learning test-II; Rivermead behavioural memory test) was completed at baseline, at 3 months after introducing donepezil, and at 3 months after donepezil was discontinued. After donepezil treatment, substantial improvements were found on tasks of nonverbal fluid reasoning (i.e. matrix reasoning) and other executive functioning tests (i.e. BADS). At entry into the study, poor academic performance and subjective problems with memory and concentration were reported, particularly after amphetamine use (i.e. MDMA and crystal methamphetamine); after donepezil treatment, dramatic increases in memory, concentration and academic achievement were observed. The finding of improvements in tests of executive functioning and in academic performance in this case study, together with the minimal adverse side effects of donepezil, warrants the investigation of controlled studies of cholinergic enhancement in chronic amphetamine and other drug users."
"2813","1","Central nervous system-related safety and tolerability of add-on ketamine to standard of care treatment in treatment-resistant psychotic depression in patients with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder.^\nBACKGROUND: Psychotic treatment-resistant depression represents a complex and challenging form of mood disorder in clinical practice. Despite its severity, psychotic depression is frequently underdiagnosed and inadequately treated. Ketamine has demonstrated rapid and potent antidepressant effects in clinical studies, while exhibiting a favorable safety and tolerability profile. Although there is limited literature available on the use of ketamine in psychotic TRD, reports on its efficacy, safety, and tolerability profile are of great interest to clinicians. The aim of this study is to investigate the relationship between dissociative symptomatology and psychomimetic effects in inpatients with treatment-resistant major psychotic depression and treatment-resistant bipolar psychotic depression, who receive intravenous ketamine treatment alongside psychotropic medication, both during and after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A total of 36 patients diagnosed with treatment-resistant unipolar (17 patients) or bipolar (18 patients) depression with psychotic features were treated with eight intravenous infusions of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine twice a week over 4 weeks. Ketamine was given in addition to their standard of care treatment. The severity of depressive symptoms was evaluated using the MADRS, while dissociative and psychomimetic symptoms were assessed using the CADSS and BPRS, respectively. RESULTS: There were no statistically significant changes observed in MADRS, CADSS, and BPRS scores within the study group during ketamine infusions. However, significant improvements in MADRS, CADSS, and BPRS scores were observed during ketamine infusions in both the unipolar and bipolar depression groups. CONCLUSION: This study provides support for the lack of exacerbation of psychotic symptoms in both unipolar and bipolar depression."
"1344","1","The Effects of Tryptamine Psychedelics in the Brain: A meta-Analysis of Functional and Review of Molecular Imaging Studies.^\nThere is an increasing interest in the neural effects of psychoactive drugs, in particular tryptamine psychedelics, which has been incremented by the proposal that they have potential therapeutic benefits, based on their molecular mimicry of serotonin. It is widely believed that they act mainly through 5HT2A receptors but their effects on neural activation of distinct brain systems are not fully understood. We performed a quantitative meta-analysis of brain imaging studies to investigate the effects of substances within this class (e.g., LSD, Psilocybin, DMT, Ayahuasca) in the brain from a molecular and functional point of view. We investigated the question whether the changes in activation patterns and connectivity map into regions with larger 5HT1A/5HT2A receptor binding, as expected from indolaemine hallucinogens (in spite of the often reported emphasis only on 5HT2AR). We did indeed find that regions with changed connectivity and/or activation patterns match regions with high density of 5HT2A receptors, namely visual BA19, visual fusiform regions in BA37, dorsal anterior and posterior cingulate cortex, medial prefrontal cortex, and regions involved in theory of mind such as the surpramarginal gyrus, and temporal cortex (rich in 5HT1A receptors). However, we also found relevant patterns in other brain regions such as dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. Moreover, many of the above-mentioned regions also have a significant density of both 5HT1A/5HT2A receptors, and available PET studies on the effects of psychedelics on receptor occupancy are still quite scarce, precluding a metanalytic approach. Finally, we found a robust neuromodulatory effect in the right amygdala. In sum, the available evidence points towards strong neuromodulatory effects of tryptamine psychedelics in key brain regions involved in mental imagery, theory of mind and affective regulation, pointing to potential therapeutic applications of this class of substances."
"3631","1","Pharmacokinetics and Pharmacodynamics of Oral Psilocybin Administration in Healthy Participants.^\nPsilocybin is being investigated as a potential treatment for psychiatric and neurological disorders. Only a few studies have evaluated the pharmacokinetics (PKs) of psilocybin and have used body weight-adjusted dosing. Data on PKs and the PK-pharmacodynamic (PD) relationship of fixed doses that are commonly used are unavailable. The present study characterized the PKs and PK-PD relationship of 15, 25, and 30 mg of orally administered psilocybin in 28, 23, and 28 healthy subjects, respectively. Plasma levels of unconjugated psilocin (the psychoactive metabolite of psilocybin) and corresponding subjective effects were repeatedly assessed up to 24 hours. PK parameters were determined using compartmental modeling. Concentration-subjective effect relationships were described using PK-PD modeling. Mean (95% confidence interval) maximal psilocin concentrations were 11 ng/mL (10-13), 17 ng/mL (16-19), and 21 ng/mL (19-24) after the administration of 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Maximal concentrations were reached after an average of 2 hours. Elimination half-lives were 1.8 hours (1.7-2.0), 1.4 hours (1.2-1.7), and 1.8 hours (1.6-1.9) for 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Mean (± SD) durations of subjective effects were 5.6 ± 2.2 hours, 5.5 ± 1.6 hours, and 6.4 ± 2.2 hours, and maximal effects (""any drug"" effects) were 58% ± 25%, 73% ± 27%, and 80% ± 18% after 15, 25, and 30 mg psilocybin, respectively. Psilocin exhibited dose-proportional PKs. The duration and intensity of subjective effects were dose-dependent. Body weight did not influence pharmacokinetics or the response to psilocybin. These data may serve as a reference for future clinical trials."
"185","1","Effects of ketamine and midazolam on resting state connectivity and comparison with ENIGMA connectivity deficit patterns in schizophrenia.^\nSubanesthetic administration of ketamine is a pharmacological model to elicit positive and negative symptoms of psychosis in healthy volunteers. We used resting-state pharmacological functional MRI (rsPhfMRI) to identify cerebral networks affected by ketamine and compared them to the functional connectivity (FC) in schizophrenia. Ketamine can produce sedation and we contrasted its effects with the effects of the anxiolytic drug midazolam. Thirty healthy male volunteers (age = 19-37 years) underwent a randomized, three-way, cross-over study consisting of three imaging sessions, with 48 hr between sessions. A session consisted of a control period followed by infusion of placebo or ketamine or midazolam. The ENIGMA rsfMRI pipeline was used to derive two long-distance (seed-based and dual-regression) and one local (regional homogeneity, ReHo) FC measures. Ketamine induced significant reductions in the connectivity of the salience network (Cohen's d: 1.13 ± 0.28, p = 4.0 × 10(-3) ), auditory network (d: 0.67 ± 0.26, p = .04) and default mode network (DMN, d: 0.63 ± 0.26, p = .05). Midazolam significantly reduced connectivity in the DMN (d: 0.77 ± 0.27, p = .03). The effect sizes for ketamine for resting networks showed a positive correlation (r = .59, p = .07) with the effect sizes for schizophrenia-related deficits derived from ENIGMA's study of 261 patients and 327 controls. Effect sizes for midazolam were not correlated with the schizophrenia pattern (r = -.17, p = .65). The subtraction of ketamine and midazolam patterns showed a significant positive correlation with the pattern of schizophrenia deficits (r = .68, p = .03). RsPhfMRI reliably detected the shared and divergent pharmacological actions of ketamine and midazolam on cerebral networks. The pattern of disconnectivity produced by ketamine was positively correlated with the pattern of connectivity deficits observed in schizophrenia, suggesting a brain functional basis for previously poorly understood effects of the drug."
"4460","1","Activation of serotonin 2A receptors underlies the psilocybin-induced effects on α oscillations, N170 visual-evoked potentials, and visual hallucinations.^\nVisual illusions and hallucinations are hallmarks of serotonergic hallucinogen-induced altered states of consciousness. Although the serotonergic hallucinogen psilocybin activates multiple serotonin (5-HT) receptors, recent evidence suggests that activation of 5-HT2A receptors may lead to the formation of visual hallucinations by increasing cortical excitability and altering visual-evoked cortical responses. To address this hypothesis, we assessed the effects of psilocybin (215 μg/kg vs placebo) on both α oscillations that regulate cortical excitability and early visual-evoked P1 and N170 potentials in healthy human subjects. To further disentangle the specific contributions of 5-HT2A receptors, subjects were additionally pretreated with the preferential 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (50 mg vs placebo). We found that psilocybin strongly decreased prestimulus parieto-occipital α power values, thus precluding a subsequent stimulus-induced α power decrease. Furthermore, psilocybin strongly decreased N170 potentials associated with the appearance of visual perceptual alterations, including visual hallucinations. All of these effects were blocked by pretreatment with the 5-HT2A antagonist ketanserin, indicating that activation of 5-HT2A receptors by psilocybin profoundly modulates the neurophysiological and phenomenological indices of visual processing. Specifically, activation of 5-HT2A receptors may induce a processing mode in which stimulus-driven cortical excitation is overwhelmed by spontaneous neuronal excitation through the modulation of α oscillations. Furthermore, the observed reduction of N170 visual-evoked potentials may be a key mechanism underlying 5-HT2A receptor-mediated visual hallucinations. This change in N170 potentials may be important not only for psilocybin-induced states but also for understanding acute hallucinatory states seen in psychiatric disorders, such as schizophrenia and Parkinson's disease."
"5518","0","Clinical investigations of the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca: rationale and regulatory challenges.^\nAyahuasca is a hallucinogenic beverage that is prominent in the ethnomedicine and shamanism of indigenous Amazonian tribes. Its unique pharmacology depends on the oral activity of the hallucinogen, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), which results from inhibition of monoamine oxidase (MAO) by beta-carboline alkaloids. MAO is the enzyme that normally degrades DMT in the liver and gut. Ayahuasca has long been integrated into mestizo folk medicine in the northwest Amazon. In Brazil, it is used as a sacrament by several syncretic churches. Some of these organizations have incorporated in the United States. The recreational and religious use of ayahuasca in the United States, as well as ""ayahuasca tourism"" in the Amazon, is increasing. The current legal status of ayahuasca or its source plants in the United States is unclear, although DMT is a Schedule I controlled substance. One ayahuasca church has received favorable rulings in 2 federal courts in response to its petition to the Department of Justice for the right to use ayahuasca under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act. A biomedical study of one of the churches, the Uñiao do Vegetal (UDV), indicated that ayahuasca may have therapeutic applications for the treatment of alcoholism, substance abuse, and possibly other disorders. Clinical studies conducted in Spain have demonstrated that ayahuasca can be used safely in normal healthy adults, but have done little to clarify its potential therapeutic uses. Because of ayahuasca's ill-defined legal status and variable botanical and chemical composition, clinical investigations in the United States, ideally under an approved Investigational New Drug (IND) protocol, are complicated by both regulatory and methodological issues. This article provides an overview of ayahuasca and discusses some of the challenges that must be overcome before it can be clinically investigated in the United States."

The psychological parameters objectified stabilisation of the psychological autonomic and emotional areas as well as ego functions. The followup study extended over an average of five yr and included 101 former drug addicts (14 could not be interviewed, 10 had died). Social stability was observed in 63% (satisfactory working performance, reduction of sexual problems, contacts with friends). 36% of the group had abstained from further drug taking, 27% were taking them periodically, 32% had to be treated again and 5% had deteriorated (trend towards invalidism)."
"4631","1","Cortisol levels and MDMA-induced memory impairment.^\nObjective: Ecstasy use is commonly linked with memory deficits in abstinent ecstasy users. Similar impairments are being found during ecstasy intoxication after single doses of MDMA. The concordance of memory impairments during intoxication and abstinence suggests a similar neuropharmacological mechanism underlying acute and chronic memory impairments. The mechanism underlying this impairment is to date not known. We hypothesized that cortisol might play an important role in this mechanism as cortisol, implicated in the regulation of memory performance, can be brought out of balance by stressors like MDMA. In the present study we aimed to block the MDMA‐induced acute memory defect by giving participants a cortisol synthesis inhibitor (Metyrapone1) together with a single dose of MDMA. Methods: Seventeen polydrug MDMA users entered this placebo controlled within subject study with four treatment conditions. The treatments consisted of MDMA (75 mg) and Metyrapone1 (750 mg), alone and in combination, and double placebo. Pretreatment with Metyrapone or Placebo occured 1 h prior to MDMA or Placebo administration. Memory performance was tested at peak drug concentrations by means of several memory tests. Cortisol levels were determined in blood ; this served as a control measure to see whether manipulations were effective. Results: Main findings indicated that whereas treatment with Metyrapone blocked the expected MDMA‐induced increase in cortisol levels in blood, it did not prevent the MDMA‐induced memory deficit from happening. Conclusion: We therefore conclude that MDMA‐induced increases in cortisol concentrations are not responsible for impairing memory performance while intoxicated with MDMA."
"1687","1","Occipital cortical proton MRS at 4 Tesla in human moderate MDMA polydrug users.^\nThe recreational drug MDMA (3,4, methylenedioxymethamphetamine; sold under the street name of Ecstasy) is toxic to serotonergic axons in some animal models of MDMA administration. In humans, MDMA use is associated with alterations in markers of brain function that are pronounced in occipital cortex. Among neuroimaging methods, magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) studies of brain metabolites N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and myoinositol (MI) at a field strength of 1.5 Tesla (T) reveal inconsistent results in MDMA users. Because higher field strength proton MRS has theoretical advantages over lower field strengths, we used proton MRS at 4.0 T to study absolute concentrations of occipital cortical NAA and MI in a cohort of moderate MDMA users (n = 9) versus non-MDMA using (n = 7) controls. Mean NAA in non-MDMA users was 10.47 mM (± 2.51), versus 9.83 mM (± 1.94) in MDMA users. Mean MI in non-MDMA users was 7.43 mM (± .68), versus 6.57 mM (± 1.59) in MDMA users. There were no statistical differences in absolute metabolite levels for NAA and MI in occipital cortex of MDMA users and controls. These findings are not supportive of MDMA-induced alterations in NAA or MI levels in this small sample of moderate MDMA users. Limitations to this study suggest caution in the interpretation of these results. © 2007 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."

An 18-FDG PET study.^\nThe aim of this study was to determine the acute effects of the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE (3,4-methylene dioxyethamphetamine) on cerebral glucose metabolism (rMRGlu) of healthy volunteers and to correlate neurometabolism with acute psychopathology. In a randomized double-blind trial, 15 healthy volunteers without a history of drug abuse were examined with fluorine-18-deoxyglucose (18FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) 110-120 min after oral administration of 2 mg/kg MDE (n = 7) or placebo (n = 8). Two minutes prior to radiotracer injection, constant cognitive stimulation was started and maintained for 32 min using a word repetition paradigm to ensure constant and comparable mental conditions during cerebral glucose uptake. Individual brain anatomy was represented using Tl-weighted 3D flash magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), followed by manual regionalization into 108 regions of interest and PET/MRI overlay. After absolute quantification of rMRGlu and normalization to global metabolism, normalized rMRGlu under MDE was compared to placebo using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Acute psychopathology was assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) and rMRGlu was correlated to PANSS scores according to Spearman. MDE subjects showed significantly decreased rMRGlu in the bilateral frontal cortex: left frontal posterior (-7.1%, P < 0.05) and right prefrontal superior (-4.6%, P < 0.05). On the other hand, rMRGlu was significantly increased in the bilateral cerebellum (right: +10.1%, P < 0.05; left: +7.6%, P < 0.05) and in the right putamen (+6.2%, P < 0.05). There were positive correlations between rMRGlu in the middle right cingulate and grandiosity (r = 0.87, P < 0.05), both the right amygdala (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) and the left posterior cingulate (r = 0.90, P < 0.01) to difficulties in abstract thinking, and the right frontal inferior (r = 0.85, P < 0.05), right anterior cingulate (r = 0.93, P < 0.01), and left anterior cingulate (r = 0.85, P < 0.05) to attentional deficits. A negative correlation was found between the left frontal operculum (Broca's area) and attentional deficits (r = -0.85, P < 0.05). The present study revealed acute neurometabolic changes under the ""Ecstasy"" analogue MDE, indicating a frontostriatocerebellar imbalance paralleling other psychotropic substances or various psychiatric disorders."
"4985","0","Changes in Stimulant Drug Use Over Time in the MACS: Evidence for Resilience Against Stimulant Drug Use Among Men Who Have Sex with Men.^\nStimulant drug use is associated with numerous health problems among men who have sex with men (MSM). This paper describes how stimulant drug use changes over a four and one-half year period from 2003 until 2008. Participants were 2,389 men (17,222 person-visits) from The Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS)-an ongoing, prospective study of HIV infection among MSM. Group-based trajectory analyses of data from these men over the study period yielded a four groups solution: consistent users (9.8%), men whose use increased (5.4%), men whose use declined (6.9%), and abstinent or rarely-using men (77.9%). There were significant differences between groups in terms of demographic, behavioral risk and HIV serostatus. Men who increased or decreased stimulant drug use over time reported congruent changes in sexual risk taking. The fact that sexual risk levels parallel stimulant drug use over time suggests that finding ways to lower rates of stimulant drug use among MSM could be a tool in HIV prevention."

METHOD: Plasma samples were collected at 40, 80, 110, 230 min on day 1, 2 and 3 in nine patients following a 40 min infusion of (R,S)-Ket (0.5 mg kg⁻¹) and analyzed for Ket, norKet and DHNK enantiomers and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK, (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK. A compartmental popPK model was constructed that included all quantified analytes, and unknown parameters were estimated with an iterative two-stage algorithm in ADAPT5. RESULTS: Ket, norKet, DHNK and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK were present during the first 230 min post infusion and significant concentrations (>5 ng ml⁻¹) were observed on day 1. Plasma concentrations of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HK and (2S,6R;2R,6S)-HK were below the limit of quantification. The average (S) : (R) plasma concentrations for Ket and DHNK were <1.0 while no significant enantioselectivity was observed for norKet. There were large inter-patient variations in terminal half-lives and relative metabolite concentrations; at 230 min (R,S)-DHNK was the major metabolite in four out of nine patients, (R,S)-norKet in three out of nine patients and (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK in two out of nine patients. The final PK model included three compartments for (R,S)-Ket, two compartments for (R,S)-norKet and single compartments for DHNK and HNK. All PK profiles were well described, and parameters for (R,S)-Ket and (R,S)-norKet were in agreement with prior estimates. CONCLUSION: This represents the first PK analysis of (2S,6S;2R,6R)-HNK and (R,S)-DHNK. The results demonstrate that while norKet is the initial metabolite, it is not the main metabolite suggesting that future Ket studies should include the analysis of the major metabolites."
"2087","0","Report on psychoactive drug use among adolescents using ayahuasca within a religious context.^\nRitual use of ayahuasca within the context of the Brazilian ayahuasca churches often starts during late childhood or early adolescence. Premature access to psychoactive drugs may represent a risk factor for drug misuse. Conversely, religious affiliation seems to play a protective role in terms of substance abuse. The objective of this study was to describe patterns of drug use in a sample of adolescents using ayahuasca within a religious setting. Forty-one adolescents from a Brazilian ayahuasca sect were compared with 43 adolescents who never drank ayahuasca. No significant differences were identified in terms of lifetime substance consumption. Throughout the previous year period, ayahuasca adolescents used less alcohol (46.31%) than the comparison group (74.4%). Recent use of alcohol was also more frequent among the latter group (65.1%) than among ayahuasca drinkers (32.5%). Although not statistically significant, slight differences in terms of patterns of drug use were definitely observed among groups. Despite their early exposure to a hallucinogenic substance, adolescents using ayahuasca in a controlled setting were mostly comparable to controls except for a considerably smaller proportion of alcohol users. Religious affiliation may have played a central role as a possible protective factor for alcohol use. Thus, ayahuasca seems to be a relatively safe substance as far as drug misuse is concerned."
"9246","0","Comparison of the effect of intravenous anesthetics used for anesthesia during electroconvulsive therapy on the hemodynamic safety and the course of ECT.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is the treatment method widely used in psychiatric disorders such as depression, bipolar disorder, schizophrenia and schizoaffective disorder. The advantage of ECT is therapeutic response that occurs significantly earlier than during pharmacotherapy. Initially ECT was used without anesthesia. Then, in the 1950s procedures with general anesthesia were introduced to reduce the complications that may occur during a seizure caused by ECT, such as broken bones, teeth, tendon rupture, muscle damage. Currently, in general anesthesia for ECT several medications are used interchangeably: thiopental, propofol, etomidate and ketamine. In different resorts and different countries different anestethics are used, the choice is determined mainly by the experience of each resort and a kind of tradition. The authors provide an overview of objective data showing how various anesthetics affect the quality of ECT and the presence of any hemodynamic complications after ETC. Selection of articles included in this paper was made by searching Medline and PubMed databases using specific keywords: electroconvulsive therapy, general anesthesia, the risks and benefits of thiopental, ketamine, propofol and etomidate. The results of this review are inconclusive when it comes to the effect of intravenous anesthetics on the quality of the ECT treatment and side effects relating to respiratory and cardiovascular system. On this basis it is impossible to determine which of intravenous anesthetics is most advantageous from the point of view of the patient. To develop the optimum scheme of anesthesia for ECT, it is necessary to conduct further, methodologically correct studies."
"8100","1","Characterization and prediction of acute and sustained response to psychedelic psilocybin in a mindfulness group retreat.^\nMeditation and psychedelics have played key roles in humankind's search for self-transcendence and personal change. However, neither their possible synergistic effects, nor related state and trait predictors have been experimentally studied. To elucidate these issues, we administered double-blind the model psychedelic drug psilocybin (315 μg/kg PO) or placebo to meditators (n = 39) during a 5-day mindfulness group retreat. Psilocybin increased meditation depth and incidence of positively experienced self-dissolution along the perception-hallucination continuum, without concomitant anxiety. Openness, optimism, and emotional reappraisal were predictors of the acute response. Compared with placebo, psilocybin enhanced post-intervention mindfulness and produced larger positive changes in psychosocial functioning at a 4-month follow-up, which were corroborated by external ratings, and associated with magnitude of acute self-dissolution experience. Meditation seems to enhance psilocybin's positive effects while counteracting possible dysphoric responses. These findings highlight the interactions between non-pharmacological and pharmacological factors, and the role of emotion/attention regulation in shaping the experiential quality of psychedelic states, as well as the experience of selflessness as a modulator of behavior and attitudes. A better comprehension of mechanisms underlying most beneficial psychedelic experiences may guide therapeutic interventions across numerous mental conditions in the form of psychedelic-assisted applications."
"9038","1","Visuo-spatial working memory deficits in current and former users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nVerbal working memory and executive deficits have been observed in ecstasy users. The present study sought to establish whether these also extended to visuo-spatial working memory. Thirty-six current ecstasy users, 12 former users (abstinent for at least 6 months) and 31 individuals that had never used ecstasy were tested on a maintenance plus type visuo-spatial working memory task. The task required participants to recall a sequence of specially marked cells in a four-by-four matrix display while at the same time performing a concurrent visual judgement task. Both the current and former user groups registered impairments relative to nonusers. These remained significant following statistical controls for a range of potentially confounding variables including the use of various other drugs during the 3 months prior to testing. Users were unimpaired on a simple spatial span measure suggesting that the deficits observed reflected the executive aspects of the spatial working memory task. Also consistent with executive involvement, statistical controls for measures of verbal working memory performance (computation span) removed half of the ecstasy-related variance in spatial working memory. The possibility that the pattern of results obtained might reflect some general impairment in information processing efficiency is discussed. Copyright © 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."

METHODS: Regular concentrate users were randomly assigned to ad libitum administration of one of two cannabis concentrate products (70 % or 90 % THC) that they purchased from a dispensary. 65 participants (N = 34 men, N = 31 women) were assessed in a mobile pharmacology lab before, immediately after, and 1 -h after ad libitum concentrate use. Plasma cannabinoids (THC, 11-OH-THC, CBD), subjective drug effects, and verbal memory errors were assessed at all three time points. RESULTS: Although men and women exhibited similar plasma 11-OH-THC levels across time (p = .10), sex differences were found in plasma THC and CBD after legal market concentrate use, with men displaying significantly higher levels of plasma THC and CBD immediately after cannabis concentrate use (plasma THC [ng/mL]: M(men) = 489.88, M(women) = 135.08, p < .001; plasma CBD [ng/mL]: M(men) = 1.14, M(women) = 0.53, p = .04). Despite this, sex differences in subjective effects and verbal memory errors did not emerge, although women reported a steeper decrease in drug liking after use (p = .04). CONCLUSION: These data provide the first look at sex differences after acute naturalistic cannabis concentrate use, and suggest much higher THC exposure in men versus women, but similar acute drug and impairment effects across the sexes. Further studies are needed to determine the mechanisms (e.g. tolerance, cannabinoid metabolism, smoking topography) behind these findings."
"4463","0","Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy as a Potential Treatment for Eating Disorders: a Narrative Review of Preliminary Evidence.^\nEating disorders (ED) are a group of potentially severe mental disorders characterized by abnormal energy balance, cognitive dysfunction and emotional distress. Cognitive inflexibility is a major challenge to successful ED treatment and dysregulated serotonergic function has been implicated in this symptomatic dimension. Moreover, there are few effective treatment options and long-term remission of ED symptoms is difficult to achieve. There is emerging evidence for the use of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy for a range of mental disorders. Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic which has demonstrated therapeutic benefit to a variety of psychiatric illnesses characterized by rigid thought patterns and treatment resistance. The current paper presents a narrative review of the hypothesis that psilocybin may be an effective adjunctive treatment for individuals with EDs, based on biological plausibility, transdiagnostic evidence and preliminary results. Limitations of the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy model and proposed future directions for the application to eating behavior are also discussed. Although the literature to date is not sufficient to propose the incorporation of psilocybin in the treatment of disordered eating behaviors, preliminary evidence supports the need for more rigorous clinical trials as an important avenue for future investigation."
"6410","0","Evaluation of dextromethorphan with select antidepressant therapy for the treatment of depression in the acute care psychiatric setting.^\nINTRODUCTION: Dextromethorphan (DXM), an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist, may have ketamine-like antidepressant effects. Dextromethorphan is extensively metabolized via cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6, and its half-life in extensive metabolizers is 2 to 4 hours. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the effects of DXM in combination with a moderate-to-strong CYP2D6 inhibitor antidepressant on depression in an acute care psychiatric setting. METHODS: This was a single-center, retrospective chart review of adult patients with a depressive disorder diagnosis. Patients who received select antidepressant therapy with or without scheduled DXM were included. The primary outcome was the difference in time to improvement of depressive symptoms, which was an average composite of physician documentation, nurse documentation, and first time to 24 hours without as-needed anxiolytics or antipsychotics. The study group consisted of patients who received DXM with select antidepressant therapy, whereas the control group included those who received only select antidepressant therapy. RESULTS: A total of 40 patients were included. The median time to clinical improvement was 3.00 days and 2.83 days for the study group and control group, respectively (P = .986). The incidence of perceptual disturbances and delusions was higher in the study group as compared with the control group (55% and 35% vs 30% and 25%, respectively). DISCUSSION: Dextromethorphan was not associated with a rapid antidepressant effect. The commonly used dose of 30 mg daily may have been too low to have an effect; additionally, the most frequently utilized select antidepressant, bupropion, has moderately less CYP2D6 inhibition than fluoxetine and paroxetine."

Both antidepressants were administered by gavage on pregnancy days 15 to 20 to groups of 10 to 12 animals each. Duration of gestation, food and water consumption, number of live pups and birth weight were recorded. Litters were culled to six pups at birth (day 1) and followed for growth until weaning (day 25). On day 60, a male and a female from each litter were injected with the 5-HT1 agonist, 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (6 mg/kg, ip) and the serotonergic syndrome was graded. Fluoxetine but not venlafaxine reduced the duration of pregnancy when compared to the control (C) group (F = 21.1 days and C = 21.6 days, mean, P<0.02; maximum = 22 days and minimum = 21 days in both groups). The highest doses of both fluoxetine, 16 mg/kg (F16), and venlafaxine, 80 mg/kg (V80), reduced the food intake of pregnant rats, resulting in different rates of body weight gain during treatment (from pregnancy day 15 to day 20): F16 = 29.0 g, V80 = 28.7 g vs C = 39.5 g (median). Birth weight was influenced by treatment and sex (P<0.05; two-way ANOVA). Both doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine reduced the body weight of litters; however, the body weight of litters from treated dams was equal to the weight of control litters by the time of weaning. At weaning there was no significant difference in weight between sexes. There was no difference among groups in number of live pups at birth, stillbirths, mortality during the lactation period or in the manifestation of seratonergic syndrome in adult rats. The occurrence of low birth weight among pups born to darns which did not show reduced food ingestion or reduction of body weight gain during treatment with lower doses of fluoxetine or venlafaxine suggests that these drugs may have a deleterious effect on prenatal development when administered during pregnancy. in addition, fluoxetine slightly but significantly affected the duration of pregnancy (about half a day), an effect not observed in the venlafaxine-treated groups."
"8637","1","Prevalence of illicit drug use in young Australian women, patterns of use and associated risk factors.^\nObjectives: To estimate the prevalence of illicit drug use in young Australian women, determine their patterns of drug use and identify associated risk factors. Methods: Data were collected in 2000 as part of the second survey of the youngest cohort in the Australian Longitudinal Study on Women's Health (n = 9512). Results: Among women aged 22-27 years, 58% reported having used an illicit drug at some time with most (57%) having used cannabis. Amphetamines (16%), ecstasy/designer drugs (15%) and LSD (14%) were the next three most commonly used drugs. Four different patterns of drug use were identified: past users of cannabis only (39%); current users of cannabis only (17%); past multiple drug users (13%) and current multiple drug users (31%). Living in a defacto relationship or never being married, living with non-family members, a history of physical abuse, sexual intercourse, smoking and binge drinking were associated significantly with exclusive use of cannabis and with use of multiple drugs compared to never using illicit drugs. Living with a partner, experience of sexual or emotional abuse, pregnancy, diagnosis of depression and taking sleeping medication were associated significantly with being a multiple drug user, but not for exclusive cannabis use. Multiple drug users had, on average, used cannabis 2-3 years before using any other drug. Conclusions: Given the strong association found between smoking, heavy drinking and drug use of varied patterns, public health initiatives targeted at preventing young women from smoking and drinking should additionally target illicit drug use."

"7165","1","A low dose of lysergic acid diethylamide decreases pain perception in healthy volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is an ergot alkaloid derivative with psychedelic properties that has been implicated in the management of persistent pain. Clinical studies in the 1960s and 1970s have demonstrated profound analgesic effects of full doses of LSD in terminally ill patients, but this line of research evaporated after LSD was scheduled worldwide. AIM: The present clinical study is the first to revisit the potential of LSD as an analgesic, and at dose levels which are not expected to produce profound mind-altering effects. METHODS: Twenty-four healthy volunteers received single doses of 5, 10 and 20 µg LSD as well as placebo on separate occasions. A Cold Pressor Test was administered at 1.5 and 5 h after treatment administration to assess pain tolerance to experimentally evoked pain. Ratings of dissociation and psychiatric symptoms as well as assessments of vital signs were included to monitor mental status as well as safety during treatments. RESULTS: LSD 20 µg significantly increased the time that participants were able to tolerate exposure to cold (3°C) water and decreased their subjective levels of experienced pain and unpleasantness. LSD elevated mean blood pressure within the normal range and slightly increased ratings of dissociation, anxiety and somatization. CONCLUSION: The present study provides evidence of a protracted analgesic effect of LSD at a dose that is low enough to avoid a psychedelic experience. The present data warrant further research into the analgesic effects of low doses of LSD in patient populations."
"273","0","Does drug use affect the efficacy of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders? Results from a pragmatic, randomised study.^\nOBJECTIVES: Drug use is prevalent in patients with schizophrenia spectrum disorders (SSD) but there is limited knowledge about the influence of drug use on the effectiveness of antipsychotic medication. This secondary explorative study compared the effectiveness of three antipsychotics in patients with SSD, with and without drug use. METHODS: The BeSt InTro multi-centre, head to head, rater-blinded randomised study compared amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine over a 1-year follow-up period. All patients (n = 144) were aged ≥18 years and met the ICD-10 criteria for SSD (F20-29). Clinical symptoms were assessed using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). The primary outcome was reduction of a PANSS positive subscale score. RESULTS: At baseline, 38% of all patients reported drug use in the last 6 months before inclusion, with cannabis as the main drug (85%), followed by amphetamine-type stimulants (45%), sedatives (26%), hallucinogens (19%), cocaine (13%), opiates (4%), GHB (4%), solvents (4%), analgesics (4%) and anabolic steroids (2%). The predominant pattern was the use of several drugs. There were no significant overall differences in the PANSS positive subscale score reduction for the three studied antipsychotics among patients either with or without drug use. In the drug use group, older patients treated with amisulpride showed a greater PANSS positive subscale score reduction during the treatment period compared to younger patients. CONCLUSION: The current study showed that drug use does not appear to affect the overall effectiveness of amisulpride, aripiprazole and olanzapine in patients with SSD. However, amisulpride may be a particularly suitable choice for older patients with drug use."
"5973","1","Effect of psychotomimetics (LSD and dextroamphetamine) on the use of primary- and secondary-process language.^\nThe present study sought to determine the effect of psychotomimetics (LSD and dextroamphetamine) on primary-process and secondary-process language. Five-minute monologues were recorded for four psychoanalytic patients in LSD, dextroamphetamine, and placebo conditions. An intensive research design was adopted, and each subject was treated as an individual experiment: (a) One patient manifested LSD-induced attenuation of secondary-process language; (b) one patient showed LSD-induced increase of primary-process language and an increase of secondary-process language when dextroamphetamine was ingested. The present findings suggest that psychotomimetics do affect ego functioning as expressed in language but that the nature of the effect (inhibition or disinhibition) is not determined by the drug alone."
"7011","1","Randomized, double-blind study of flexibly-dosed intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant vs. active control in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBackground: About 30% of the patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) fail to achieve remission despite treatment with multiple antidepressant medications, and are considered to have treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). New treatment options for TRD patients are needed. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of switching adult patients with TRD from a prior antidepressant treatment (to which they had not responded) to intranasal esketamine plus a newly initiated oral antidepressant compared with switching to a newly initiated oral antidepressant (active comparator) plus intranasal placebo, in improving depressive symptoms. Methods: This was a Phase 3, double‐blind, active‐controlled, multicenter study (NCT02418585) using blinded raters, conducted at 39 sites in Spain, Germany, Czech Republic, Poland, and the United States from August 2015 to June 2017. The study enrolled adults with moderate‐to‐severe, non‐psychotic, recurrent or persistent (single episode) depression, and history of non‐response to ≥2 antidepressants in the current episode of depression, with 1 of them assessed prospectively. The non‐responders to standard‐of‐care treatment were randomized (1:1) to flexibly‐dosed intranasal esketamine (56 or 84 mg twice weekly) and a new oral antidepressant (given daily) or to a new oral antidepressant and intranasal placebo. The primary efficacy endpoint – change from baseline to endpoint (day 28) in Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score – was assessed among patients who received ≥1 dose of (intranasal and oral) study medication by a mixed‐effects model using repeated measures. Remission rate, a secondary endpoint, was assessed using Generalized Cochran‐Mantel‐Haenszel (CMH) test, adjusting for country and class of oral antidepressant (SNRI or SSRI) as a post hoc analysis. Results: 435 patients were screened, 227 randomized, and 197 completed the double‐blind period. Change (LS mean [SE] difference vs. placebo) in MADRS total score with intranasal esketamine plus oral antidepressant was superior to oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo at day 28 (‐4.0 [1.69], 95% CI: ‐7.31, ‐0.64; 1‐sided p=0.010), as well as at earlier timepoints (1‐sided p≤0.009 at 24 hours postdose and days 8 and 22). Remission rate (MADRS total score ≤12) at day 28 was 52.5% (53/101) and 31.0% (31/100) for the respective groups (1‐sided p=0.001), with the number needed to treat (NNT) (95% CI) for remission of 5 (1.8; 7.5). The most common adverse events reported for the esketamine plus oral antidepressant group were dysgeusia, nausea, vertigo, and dizziness; the incidence of each (20.9‐26.1%) was >2‐fold higher than for the oral antidepressant plus intranasal placebo group. Conclusions: Robust efficacy of intranasal esketamine and superiority to an active comparator were demonstrated on the primary efficacy endpoint result. More than half of the esketamine‐treated TRD patients achieved remission by the 4‐week endpoint. Favorable safety and tolerability of intranasal esketamine reported in this study suggest a positive risk‐benefit profile of intranasal esketamine.

"8481","1","Ketamine for Social Anxiety Disorder: A Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Crossover Trial.^\nMany patients with social anxiety disorder (SAD) experience inadequate symptom relief from available treatments. Ketamine is a potent N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with a potentially novel mechanism of action for the treatment of anxiety disorders. Therefore, we conducted a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial in 18 adults with DSM-5 SAD and compared the effects between intravenous ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) and placebo (normal saline) on social phobia symptoms. Ketamine and placebo infusions were administered in a random order with a 28-day washout period between infusions. Ratings of anxiety were assessed 3-h post-infusion and followed for 14 days. We used linear mixed models to assess the impact of ketamine and placebo on anxiety symptoms. Outcomes were blinded ratings on the Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) and self-reported anxiety on a visual analog scale (VAS-Anxiety). We also used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare the proportion of treatment responders. Based on prior studies, we defined response as a greater than 35% LSAS reduction and 50% VAS-Anxiety reduction. We found ketamine resulted in a significantly greater reduction in anxiety relative to placebo on the LSAS (Time × Treatment: F(9,115)=2.6, p=0.01) but not the VAS-Anxiety (Time × Treatment: F(10,141)=0.4, p=0.95). Participants were significantly more likely to exhibit a treatment response after ketamine infusion relative to placebo in the first 2 weeks following infusion measured on the LSAS (33.33% response ketamine vs 0% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.24, p=0.025) and VAS (88.89% response ketamine vs 52.94% response placebo, Wilcoxon signed-rank test z=2.12, p=0.034). In conclusion, this proof-of-concept trial provides initial evidence that ketamine may be effective in reducing anxiety."
"3782","1","Effects of MDMA alone and after pretreatment with reboxetine, duloxetine, clonidine, carvedilol, and doxazosin on pupillary light reflex.^\nRATIONALE: Pupillometry can be used to characterize autonomic drug effects. OBJECTIVE: This study was conducted to determine the autonomic effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy), administered alone and after pretreatment with reboxetine, duloxetine, clonidine, carvedilol, and doxazosin, on pupillary function. METHODS: Infrared pupillometry was performed in five placebo-controlled randomized studies. Each study included 16 healthy subjects (eight men, eight women) who received placebo-MDMA (125 mg), placebo-placebo, pretreatment-placebo, or pretreatment-MDMA using a crossover design. RESULTS: MDMA produced mydriasis, prolonged the latency, reduced the response to light, and shortened the recovery time. The impaired reflex response was associated with subjective, cardiostimulant, and hyperthermic drug effects and returned to normal within 6 h after MDMA administration when plasma MDMA levels were still high. Mydriasis was associated with changes in plasma MDMA concentration over time and longer-lasting. Both reboxetine and duloxetine interacted with the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Clonidine did not significantly reduce the mydriatic effects of MDMA, although it produced miosis when administered alone. Carvedilol and doxazosin did not alter the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. CONCLUSIONS: The MDMA-induced prolongation of the latency to and reduction of light-induced miosis indicate indirect central parasympathetic inhibition, and the faster recovery time reflects an increased sympathomimetic action. Both norepinephrine and serotonin mediate the effects of MDMA on pupillary function. Although mydriasis is lasting and mirrors the plasma concentration-time curve of MDMA, the impairment in the reaction to light is associated with the subjective and other autonomic effects of MDMA and exhibits acute tolerance."
"3078","0","Evaluating the pharmacologic treatment of psychosis.^\nBefore making clinical investigations with psychopharmacological drugs, the pharmacological kinetics of the drug which is to be tried should be analyzed as closely as possible. Collections of case histories and uncontrolled investigations cannot be assigned any value as evidence. The antipsychotic effect must be illustrated in relation to another known psychopharmacological drug with the same indication. The effect of the treatment must be evaluated objectively. Estimation, using rating scales in combination with the double blind technique, is a method of investigation which may be accepted, at least for the present, as being sufficiently objective. However, caution is advisable in interpreting the results of ratings. As far as possible, psychological tests should also be carried out and psycho physiological standards should be followed, in order to consolidate the antipsychotic effect. The recording of side effects is important, since the usefulness of a preparation is also related to its side effects."
"7304","1","Effects of the South American psychoactive beverage ayahuasca on regional brain electrical activity in humans: a functional neuroimaging study using low-resolution electromagnetic tomography.^\nAyahuasca, a South American psychotropic plant tea obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, combines monoamine oxidase-inhibiting beta-carboline alkaloids with N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), a psychedelic agent showing 5-HT(2A) agonist activity. In a clinical research setting, ayahuasca has demonstrated a combined stimulatory and psychedelic effect profile, as measured by subjective effect self-assessment instruments and dose-dependent changes in spontaneous brain electrical activity, which parallel the time course of subjective effects. In the present study, the spatial distribution of ayahuasca-induced changes in brain electrical activity was investigated by means of low-resolution electromagnetic tomography (LORETA). Electroencephalography recordings were obtained from 18 volunteers after the administration of a dose of encapsulated freeze-dried ayahuasca containing 0.85 mg DMT/kg body weight and placebo. The intracerebral power density distribution was computed with LORETA from spectrally analyzed data, and subjective effects were measured by means of the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). Statistically significant differences compared to placebo were observed for LORETA power 60 and 90 min after dosing, together with increases in all six scales of the HRS. Ayahuasca decreased power density in the alpha-2, delta, theta and beta-1 frequency bands. Power decreases in the delta, alpha-2 and beta-1 bands were found predominantly over the temporo-parieto-occipital junction, whereas theta power was reduced in the temporomedial cortex and in frontomedial regions. The present results suggest the involvement of unimodal and heteromodal association cortex and limbic structures in the psychological effects elicited by ayahuasca."

There was little alteration of normal body function. Significant, but small, changes in sublingual temperature (0.4° F decrease), and diastolic blood pressure (1.7 mm Hg increase) were induced. Among the battery of tests assessing behavioral or mood feeling variables, only 2 showed significant between condition effects: facilitated performance on the Cross out Test (attention and perception), and a dose related decrease in Morphine Benzedrine Group (MBG) scores of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI) (mild euphoria). On the whole, subjects had few subjective reactions or unpleasant side effects. Naltrexone appears to be a safe, nontoxic medication in the dosage range examined."
"6779","0","Cannabis-induced psychotic disorders.^\nCannabis, and more specifically THC, has been proven, through clinical observation and laboratory confirmation, to cause psychiatric symptoms as a result of intoxication and withdrawal. These transient effects include positive and negative psychotic symptoms. In clinical settings, the official nosological system identifies this entity as cannabis-induced psychotic disorder. Epidemiologic studies found an incidence for this disorder of about 2.7 per 100,000 person years. Rate of conversion to schizophrenia-spectrum disorders ranges between 44.5% and 46% in 5–8 years of follow-up. Diagnostic tools to identify cannabis-induced psychotic disorder have limited reliability, especially if used outside of research settings with highly trained interviewers. Since the literature on this topic is so conflicting with regard to nosology, this chapter will focus on Cannabis-Induced Psychotic Disorder, as described in the DSM-5, which can be described as an acute, transient, self limited psychotic reaction during cannabis intoxication or withdrawal in the absence of a primary psychotic disorder. Laboratory evidence for this disorder has been collected through the past decade. D'Souza et al. designed an experiment to characterize the dose-related psychotomimetic effects of THC, in healthy individuals under double-blind, placebo-controlled laboratory conditions, using standardized behavioral and cognitive assessments. The group found that intravenous injection of THC produced transient effects including positive symptoms (suspiciousness, paranoid and grandiose delusions, conceptual disorganization, and illusions); negative symptoms (blunted affect, reduced rapport, lack of spontaneity, psychomotor retardation, and emotional withdrawal); perceptual alterations; euphoria; anxiety; and deficits in working memory, recall, and attention, without altering general orientation. Similar effects have been replicated in several studies from different research. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"2824","0","Hallucinogenic drug research: impact on science and society.^\nOf the 9 chapters, only one is devoted exclusively to a discussion of the psychological state produced by psychedelic agents, perhaps reflecting the presumed sophistication of the reading audience. Two chapters relate studies of LSD in the treatment of alcoholism. In another chapter an early enthusiast of LSD treatment for many conditions, now is circumspect about its therapeutic efficacy. Adverse reactions to LSD are the sole focus of two authors, and the chapters on therapeutic applications also tabulate untoward effects. In reading through the discussions of chromosome damage and embryonic malformations, one is struck by the fact that now, almost two yr since these were first noted, their relevance to human drug takers is still unclear. The verified dangers of psychedelic drug use are psychological in nature, including prolonged psychotic episodes and 'flash backs'. It might be useful to attempt to define 'hallucinogenic' drugs. A number of terms have been used interchangeably to designate these psychoactive agents, including 'hallucinogen', 'psychedelic', 'psychotomimetic', 'psychodysleptic', and 'psychosomimetic'. This class of drugs embraces a variety of chemicals which share the ability to produce a unique and specific assortment of subjective changes in human subjects. Drugs of this type include d lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD 25), dimethyltryptamine (DMT), psilocybin, mescaline and a group of compounds chemically related to mescaline and amphetamine of which the two best known examples are 'STP' (DOM) (2,5 dimethoxy 4 methylamphetamine) and MDA (3,4 methylenedioxyamphetamine). Their hallmark is the evocation of marked alterations in self awareness. STASH is a student run organization devoted to the dissemination of valid information about psychoactive drugs."
"1142","1","Transcriptomics-informed large-scale cortical model captures topography of pharmacological neuroimaging effects of LSD.^\nPsychoactive drugs can transiently perturb brain physiology while preserving brain structure. The role of physiological state in shaping neural function can therefore be investigated through neuroimaging of pharmacologically induced effects. Previously, using pharmacological neuroimaging, we found that neural and experiential effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are attributable to agonism of the serotonin-2A receptor (Preller et al., 2018). Here, we integrate brain-wide transcriptomics with biophysically based circuit modeling to simulate acute neuromodulatory effects of LSD on human cortical large-scale spatiotemporal dynamics. Our model captures the inter-areal topography of LSD-induced changes in cortical blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) functional connectivity. These findings suggest that serotonin-2A-mediated modulation of pyramidal-neuronal gain is a circuit mechanism through which LSD alters cortical functional topography. Individual-subject model fitting captures patterns of individual neural differences in pharmacological response related to altered states of consciousness. This work establishes a framework for linking molecular-level manipulations to systems-level functional alterations, with implications for precision medicine."
"1762","1","Transient resolution of treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder following ketamine infusion.^\nPresents a case report of a 23-year-old veteran presented to a European Army Medical Center in 2008 complaining of irritability and poor sleep, 6 months after a 15-month deployment. His platoon had been stationed at a remote outpost subject to daily bombardment, with the veteran participating in more than 300 firefights, frequent enough that he reported that by the end he dragged himself out of bed automatically at the sound of gunfire, donned gear, and numbly moved to his defensive position. He had multiple confirmed kills, watched several soldiers close to him wounded and killed, and was grazed by a sniper bullet while on guard duty. Guilt feelings became unbearable after one firefight that killed an Afghan child. Despite disillusionment and increasing psychological turmoil, he sought no treatment while in country. According to the veteran and his wife, PTSD symptoms worsened in the year after his return to Europe. He had nightly fragmented sleep of only 3 hours during which he thrashed, screamed, and had nightmares of loved ones being killed in combat, awakening drenched in sweat. Treatment was approved by the local U.S. Army medical commander and followed published protocols. After a 24-hour medication washout, the veteran was administered propofol 30 mg and ketamine 35 mg in the postanesthesia care unit over 20 minutes under the supervision of a psychiatrist and anesthesiologist. The veteran regained consciousness and experienced no side effects except transient nystagmus and visual distortions. This case report indicates that intravenous ketamine may be efficacious even for extremely treatment-resistant PTSD. Previous reports have noted that incidental perioperative ketamine decreases subsequent PTSD symptoms in burn patients but worsens them in moderately injured physical trauma survivors When given experimentally acutely after trauma, ketamine either worsened PTSD or had no effect. A Phase II trial in nontreatment-resistant PTSD is currently underway at Mount Sinai. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8578","1","The external validity of results derived from ecstasy users recruited using purposive sampling strategies.^\nThis study sought to compare the patterns and correlates of 'recent' and 'regular' ecstasy use estimated on the basis of two datasets generated in 2001 in New South Wales, Australia, from a probability and a non-probability sample. The first was the National Drug Strategy Household Survey (NDSHS), a multistage probability sample of the general population; and the second was the Illicit Drug Reporting System (IDRS) Party Drugs Module, for which regular ecstasy users were recruited using purposive sampling strategies. NDSHS recent ecstasy users (any use in the preceding 12 months) were compared on a range of demographic and drug use variables to NDSHS regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 12 months) and purposively sampled regular ecstasy users (at least monthly use in the preceding 6 months). The demographic characteristics of the three samples were consistent. Among all three, the mean age was approximately 25 years, and a majority (60%) of subjects were male, relatively well-educated, and currently employed or studying. Patterns of ecstasy use were similar among the three samples, although compared to recent users, regular users were likely to report more frequent use of ecstasy. All samples were characterised by extensive polydrug use, although the two samples of regular ecstasy users reported higher rates of other illicit drug use than the sample of recent users. The similarities between the demographic and drug use characteristics of the samples are striking, and suggest that, at least in NSW, purposive sampling that seeks to draw from a wide cross-section of users and to sample a relatively large number of individuals, can give rise to samples of ecstasy users that may be considered sufficiently representative to reasonably warrant the drawing of inferences relating to the entire population. These findings may partially offset concerns that purposive samples of ecstasy users are likely to remain a primary source of ecstasy-related information. © 2003 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"3009","0","Predictors of outcomes in drug abuse treatment - A prospective study about 257 patients of the Cassini center in Paris.^\nAssessing the effectiveness of treatment is one of the main conceens of any medical process. The different ways proposed for assuming the responsibility of drug addicts and their efficacy are greatly heterogeneous since drug-abusing takes on diverse forms. Thus, in order to closely target the request of drug addicts and adjust their follow-up, we undertook to study prospectively, for 3 months, a population of drug addicts taking medical advice for the first time at the Cassini center in Paris, with the assumption that some predictors may forecast outcomes. Method : Data were obtained at the admission with a structured interview about socio-economic and demographic status, psychiatric disorders (assessed clinically according to DSM III-R and with HAD and MADRS scales), substance use and prior treatment history, environmental data (as well as familial substance use or support lending). Medical and paramedical referents have been interviewed after their first contact with the patient about his expectations and his motivation. Familial attendance at this first contact was noted as well as its implication in the programm. At the end of the study, we noted length of stay, regularity of follow up and clinical changes with a last interview of the staff. Results : Half the time, patients' follow up doesn't last a month, drug abuse doesn't change in 6 out of 10 cases, and we only note 14% of durable abstinence. Polydrug abuse (over 80%) is not linked, here, with pejorative outcomes, in opposition to the usual literature. Heroin is the main substance used by our population (over 80%), other opiates, sedatives and alcohol are associated by more than 30% of these patients ; cocain is associated in a quarter of the cases. More than 10% of the patients are concerned by ecstasy and LSD. Cannabis use is common. Medical complaint (mainly viral diseases) at the begining, of the programm, concerns one of two patients. Only a few are initialy known as being HIV positive, suggesting a great lack of information. Over forty percent of the patients are given a DSM III-R diagnosis at the end of the first medical advice, when a doubt subsists for a third of the other patients. Major depressive disorder for the first axis and borderline personality disorder for the second axis are the main disorders we founded. We also noted a large ratio (n = 13, 5%) of schizophrenic disorders. Univariate analysis: Length and regularity of the programms are key factors of their efficacy. A long follow-up is also required to improve patients' socio-economical status. Initial psychiatric disorders are linked, in our study as well as in literature, with longer stays in therapeutic programms. By revenge, psychiatric disorders at the third month (over 10%) are linked with poorer outcomes. We noted with interest that, in our sample, neither imprisonment in the past (over 40%, but we noted several imprisonments in a case out of two), or intraveinous route at any moment of the patient's life time (40%), or else a programm caused by a court (a quarter of the patients) are of wrong prognosis. Relatives' implication in the programm is linked with favorable outcomes. Multivariate analysis draws 3 independant clusters about the length of stay. One concerns patient's motivation as assessed by medical staff. An other one concerns patient's relatives' implication in the care. A third one is about the begining of the treatment: an initial medical prescrition and a psychological help are linked with favorable outcomes. About the efficacy, multivariate analysis isolates 4 independant clusters. Prior drug abuse programms (one out of three patients) are associated with poorer outcomes, when, by revenge, familial relationship initialy seen by the patient as (very) satisfaying, patient's motivation, and, again, an initial medical prescription are linked with better outcomes. The study of those of the patients whose programm lasted more then 3 months but without any appreciable benefit shows that a long follow-up is successfull when iris regular, when it provides a socio-economical status improvement and when the patient is given access to insight. For these patients, the (old) age is associated with better outcomes. By revenge, such a 3 months follow-up is not able to reduce drug abuse when a psychiatric disorder exists at the third month. Patients whose treatment was refered by a court don't differ from the others: their length of stay and outcomes are the same. Discussion: Our study confirms our initial hypothesis according to witch subgroups in our population of drug abusers should be isolated and that some predictors of outcomes should be described. Three points seem important to be discussed. First, a medical presciption appears to be important to initiate the relationship between the patient and his practicioner. We have never see any report about this particular point. Second, our study proves the importance of the patient's relatives' implication in the programm. Finaly, a programm ordered by a court is not pejorative per se. According to the literature, the other results we obtained corroborate some factors detected by other studies, and emphasize the priority of subjective contingents, especially psychopathological ones, over socio-demographical elements. The main limit of this study holds in the fact that our sample only concerns 78% of the population we could include in the study, according to the well known difficulties of such studies. It should be of interest to complete this study, especially to confirm these predictors on a longer term, in other centers and cities. Conclusion: According to the literature, this study accounts for the necessary global and sustained work with drug abusers. We have to answer to these patients' multiple requests, that don't just concern drug abuse, but also (and sometimes merely) psychiatric suffering, social isolation, or medical disease."
"7354","1","Ketamine dysregulates the amplitude and connectivity of high-frequency oscillations in cortical–subcortical networks in humans: Evidence from resting-state magnetoencephalography-recordings.^\nHypofunctioning of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) has been prominently implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia (ScZ). The current study tested the effects of ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic and NMDA-R antagonist, on resting-state activity recorded with magnetoencephalography (MEG) in healthy volunteers. In a single-blind cross-over design, each participant (n = 12) received, on 2 different sessions, a subanesthetic dose of S-ketamine (0.006 mg/Kg) and saline injection. MEG-data were analyzed at sensor- and source-level in the beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (30–90 Hz) frequency ranges. In addition, connectivity analysis at source-level was performed using transfer entropy (TE). Ketamine increased gamma-power while beta-band activity was decreased. Specifically, elevated 30–90 Hz activity was pronounced in subcortical (thalamus and hippocampus) and cortical (frontal and temporal cortex) regions, whilst reductions in beta-band power were localized to the precuneus, cerebellum, anterior cingulate, temporal and visual cortex. TE analysis demonstrated increased information transfer in a thalamo-cortical network after ketamine administration. The findings are consistent with the pronounced dysregulation of high-frequency oscillations following the inhibition of NMDA-R in animal models of ScZ as well as with evidence from electroencephalogram-data in ScZ-patients and increased functional connectivity during early illness stages. Moreover, our data highlight the potential contribution of thalamo-cortical connectivity patterns towards ketamine-induced neuronal dysregulation, which may be relevant for the understanding of ScZ as a disorder of disinhibition of neural circuits.

"469","1","Oxytocin in response to MDMA provocation test in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus): a single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Disruptions of the hypothalamic-pituitary axis can cause an arginine vasopressin deficiency, also known as central diabetes insipidus. Patients with this condition are at high risk of additional oxytocin deficiency owing to the close anatomical proximity of oxytocin-producing neurons; however, no conclusive evidence for such a deficiency has been reported. We aimed to use 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, also known as ecstasy), a strong activator of the central oxytocinergic system, as a biochemical and psychoactive provocation test to investigate oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus). METHODS: This single-centre, case-control study with nested, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover trial included patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and healthy controls (matched 1:1 by age, sex, and BMI) and was conducted at the University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland. We used block randomisation to assign participants to receive either a single oral dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo in the first experimental session; patients received the opposite treatment at the next session, with a wash-out period of at least 2 weeks between the two sessions. Participants and investigators assessing the outcomes were masked to assignment. Oxytocin concentrations were measured at 0, 90, 120, 150, 180, and 300 min after MDMA or placebo. The primary outcome was the area under the plasma oxytocin concentration curve (AUC) after drug intake. The AUC was compared between groups and conditions using a linear mixed-effects model. Subjective drug effects were assessed throughout the study using ten-point visual analogue scales. Acute adverse effects were assessed before and 360 min after drug intake using a 66-item list of complaints. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04648137. FINDINGS: Between Feb 1, 2021, and May 1, 2022, we recruited 15 patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus) and 15 healthy controls. All participants completed the study and were included in the analyses. In healthy controls, median plasma oxytocin concentration was 77 pg/mL (IQR 59-94) at baseline and increased by 659 pg/mL (355-914) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 102 095 pg/mL (41 782-129 565); in patients, baseline oxytocin concentration was 60 pg/mL (51-74) and only slightly increased by 66 pg/mL (16-94) in response to MDMA, resulting in an AUC of 6446 pg/mL (1291-11 577). The effect of MDMA on oxytocin was significantly different between groups: the AUC for oxytocin was 82% (95% CI 70-186) higher in healthy controls than in patients (difference 85 678 pg/mL [95% CI 63 356-108 000], p<0·0001). The increase in oxytocin in healthy controls was associated with typical strong subjective prosocial, empathic, and anxiolytic effects, whereas only minimal subjective effects were observed in patients, in agreement with the lack of increase in oxytocin concentrations. The most frequently reported adverse effects were fatigue (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of appetite (ten [67%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients), lack of concentration (eight [53%] healthy controls and seven [47%] patients), and dry mouth (eight [53%] healthy controls and eight [53%] patients). In addition, two (13%) healthy controls and four (27%) patients developed transient mild hypokalaemia. INTERPRETATION: These findings are highly suggestive of clinically meaningful oxytocin deficiency in patients with arginine vasopressin deficiency (central diabetes insipidus), laying the groundwork for a new hypothalamic-pituitary disease entity.

"6080","1","D-cycloserine for Relapse Prevention Following Intravenous Ketamine in Treatment-resistant Depression.^\nBackground MDD is one of the leading causes of disability worldwide [5]. A substantial proportion of patients do not achieve adequate remission despite multiple antidepressant trials and augmentation strategies. TRD is defined as an insufficient response to at least two adequate antidepressant trials. Many of these patients are referred to somatic treatment; e.g. electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (rTMS) and Vagal Nerve Stimulation (VNS), all of which can cause side effects, and are not always efficacious. Ketamine has been safely used for decades for the induction and maintenance of anesthesia and more recently for chronic pain. Ketamine is a noncompetitive, high‐affinity antagonist of the NMDA type glutamate receptor, with additional effects on dopamine and μ‐opioid receptors. During the last decade, 4 meta analyses summarizing over 22 controlled trials have been published, showing the rapid and impressive effect of ketamine in TRD patients [6‐8]. These trials show that a single slow IV ketamine sub‐anesthetic dose (0.5 mg/kg) over 40 minutes dramatically improves depressive symptoms. Across studies, a clinically significant antidepressant response was maintained for up to 72 hours in approximately half of the patients; only a minority had relapsed within the first two weeks post‐ketamine infusion [9, 10]. aan het Rot et al. [11] showed that repeated IV ketamine infusions prolong the duration of improvement. D‐cycloserine (seromycin) is a broad spectrum antibiotic, in use for over thirty years in the treatment of tuberculosis, DCS functions as a partial agonist at the NMDA‐R glycine site, with agonist effects predominating at low dose and antagonist effects at high dose. Low DCS dosages, such as 50‐500 mg/d have been implemented in anxiety patients for memory and learning enhancement. Beneficial antidepressant effects have been reported when higher dosages (500‐1000 mg/day) were used [3]. DCS regimens in TRD patients suggest that high dose DCS may indeed be beneficial in the treatment of MDD. However, a previous study using a lower dosage (250mg/d) did not show significant difference over placebo [3]. The antidepressant effects of DCS seem to derive from its ability to inhibit NMDA‐R function, similarly to ketamine. One recent study demonstrated a beneficial effect of DCS after ketamine infusion in bipolar depression patients [12]. Due to the potential neurotoxicity of ketamine in prolonged administration. Other NMDA antagonist should follow ketamine infusion [13]. Therefore we reason that DCS post‐ketamine administration will considerably reduce relapse in TRD patients when compared to placebo. Study Design 2. For patients who will meet response criteria (MADRS≥25%) after 6 ketamine infusions, ketamine administration (weeks 1‐3: days 1‐21) will be stopped and patients will start receiving DCS or placebo titrated slowly up to 1000mg/d over the next 8 weeks [2] in the following manner: 1. Week 4: Days 22‐24 ‐ 250mg/d, one pill per day Well‐being assessment and adverse effect evaluation before drug elevation. 2. Mid‐week 4 to end of week 6: Days 25‐42 ‐ 500mg/d, two pills per day 3. Week 7: Day 43‐49 ‐ 750mg/d, three pills per day 4. Weeks 8‐11: Days 50‐77 ‐ 1000mg/d four pills per day 3. Pyridoxine 200‐300mg/d will be prescribed for all patients at the beginning of the study. 4. Patients who did not improve after 6 ketamine treatments will be removed from the study. 1. Patients will undergo 6 ketamine infusions within a 3‐week period. Intravenous ketamine will be administrated by a senior anesthesiologist and under the supervision of a senior psychiatrist hence ensuring patient safety. We believe that sub‐anesthetic ketamine infusion will be safer and will cause fewer side effects than ECT. The procedure will be explained in detail to each patient, and written consent will be obtained. After a psychiatric and medical evaluation by a senior psychiatrist and a senior anesthesiologist, patients will be given ketamine nfusion added on to their antidepressant therapy. A slow ketamine infusion of 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes will be given to the patients. Patients will be monitored by the experienced staff which includes a senior anesthesiologist and a nurse as well as a psychiatrist who will be available nearby. All patients will be monitored continuously for heart rate and rhythm and oxygen saturation, and blood pressure will be measured at 10 minutes intervals. Heart rate variability will be measured and analyzed after ketamine treatment. Measurements will be performed during the ketamine infusion at baseline, after 3 and 6 treatments. Depressive symptoms will be measured using Montgomery Asberg Depression Scale (MADRS). In addition Clinical Global Severity Scale (CGI‐S) and Clinical Global Improvement (CGI‐I) will be performed 2 hours after treatment. In many cases, patients with depression also suffer from alexithymia: inappropriate identification of emotions. Alexithymia will be measured at baseline after 3 and 6 treatments. Ketamine infusion will be stopped in cases of a 20% or above increase in blood pressure or in heart rate over baseline values and/ or an acute dissociative state. Patients will be discharged to their homes at least three hours from end of infusion. Due to the potential effect of ketamine each patient will need to be escorted to and from the hospital by a family member or a friend."
"8715","1","Migraine prevalence in visual snow with prior illicit drug use (hallucinogen persisting perception disorder) versus without.^\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: This study was undertaken to investigate migraine prevalence in persons with hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) presenting as visual snow syndrome (VSS). METHODS: Persons with visual snow as a persisting symptom after illicit drug use (HPPD) were recruited via a Dutch consulting clinic for recreational drug use. A structured interview on (visual) perceptual symptomatology, details of drugs use, and medical and headache history was taken. As a control group, persons with visual snow who had never used illicit drugs prior to onset were included. The primary outcome was lifetime prevalence of migraine. Symptom severity was evaluated by the Visual Snow Handicap Inventory (VHI), a 25-item questionnaire. RESULTS: None of the 24 HPPD participants had migraine, whereas 20 of 37 (54.1%) controls had migraine (p < 0.001). VHI scores did not differ significantly between the two groups; in both groups, the median score was 38 of 100. In most HPPD cases (17/24, 70.9%), visual snow had started after intake of ecstasy; other psychedelic drugs reported included cannabis, psilocybin mushrooms, amphetamine, 4-fluoroamphetamine, 3-methylmethcathinone, 4-Bromo-2,5-dimethoxypenethylamine, and nitrous oxide. CONCLUSIONS: Whereas none of the HPPD participants had migraine, more than half of the visual snow controls without prior use of illicit drugs had migraine. This suggests that at least partly different pathophysiological factors play a role in these disorders. Users of ecstasy and other hallucinogens should be warned of the risk of visual snow. Further studies are needed to enhance understanding of the underlying neurobiology of HPPD and VSS to enable better management of these conditions."
"1985","1","Consciousness alterations in a cohort of young Swiss men: Associations with substance use and personality traits.^\nBackground: Substance-induced consciousness alterations (CA) have mainly been studied among users of psychedelics but not among people using street drugs. Aims: Explore occurrences of three different types of substance-induced CA [ego dissolution (ED), visual pseudo-hallucinations (VPH), anxiety/paranoia (A/P)] and their perceived influences on life, together with their associations with substance use and personality correlates in a general population sample of 25-year-old men. Methods: 2,796 young Swiss men lifetime substance users completed a self-report questionnaire including history of use (never, former, and current) of different substances categories (psychedelics, cocaine, psychostimulants, ecstasy, MDMA, and other drugs), substance-induced ego dissolution (ED), visual pseudo-hallucinations (VPH) and anxiety/paranoia (A/P), the influence of these CA experiences on life, and personality traits (sensation seeking, sociability, anxiety-neuroticism, and aggression–hostility). Results: 32.2% reported at least one CA (i.e., ED, VPH or A/P), with 20.5% reporting ED, 16.7% VPH, and 14.6% A/P. Former and current use of psychedelics and ketamine was significantly associated with occurrences of all three types of CAs and with a positive influence of CA on life. Associations between the former and current use of other substances and the different types of CA were less consistent, and perceived influences on life were not statistically significant. Sociability was negatively associated with occurrences of all three types of CA. Positive associations were found between anxiety–neuroticism and ED and A/P, between aggression–hostility and A/P, and between sensation seeking and ED and VPH. Conclusion: This study supports the potential for psychedelics to induce CAs perceived as beneficial to life among people using street drugs, possibly reflecting the mechanism underlying the therapeutic potential of psychedelics."
"98","1","Validation of ketamine as a pharmacological model of thalamic dysconnectivity across the illness course of schizophrenia.^\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) hypofunction is a leading pathophysiological model of schizophrenia. Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) studies demonstrate a thalamic dysconnectivity pattern in schizophrenia involving excessive connectivity with sensory regions and deficient connectivity with frontal, cerebellar, and thalamic regions. The NMDAR antagonist ketamine, when administered at sub-anesthetic doses to healthy volunteers, induces transient schizophrenia-like symptoms and alters rsfMRI thalamic connectivity. However, the extent to which ketamine-induced thalamic dysconnectivity resembles schizophrenia thalamic dysconnectivity has not been directly tested. The current double-blind, placebo-controlled study derived an NMDAR hypofunction model of thalamic dysconnectivity from healthy volunteers undergoing ketamine infusions during rsfMRI. To assess whether ketamine-induced thalamic dysconnectivity was mediated by excess glutamate release, we tested whether pre-treatment with lamotrigine, a glutamate release inhibitor, attenuated ketamine's effects. Ketamine produced robust thalamo-cortical hyper-connectivity with sensory and motor regions that was not reduced by lamotrigine pre-treatment. To test whether the ketamine thalamic dysconnectivity pattern resembled the schizophrenia pattern, a whole-brain template representing ketamine's thalamic dysconnectivity effect was correlated with individual participant rsfMRI thalamic dysconnectivity maps, generating ""ketamine similarity coefficients"" for people with chronic (SZ) and early illness (ESZ) schizophrenia, individuals at clinical high-risk for psychosis (CHR-P), and healthy controls (HC). Similarity coefficients were higher in SZ and ESZ than in HC, with CHR-P showing an intermediate trend. Higher ketamine similarity coefficients correlated with greater hallucination severity in SZ. Thus, NMDAR hypofunction, modeled with ketamine, reproduces the thalamic hyper-connectivity observed in schizophrenia across its illness course, including the CHR-P period preceding psychosis onset, and may contribute to hallucination severity."
"692","1","Relationships between reduction in symptoms and restoration of function and wellbeing: Outcomes of the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS).^\nRecovery of functioning is integral to successful treatment outcomes in depressive illness. Optimal antidepressant treatment results in both symptomatic remission and functional recovery. Oral ketamine rapidly reduces suicidality and depression; however, reports of functional and wellbeing outcomes are lacking. This study examines participants' social and occupational functioning and wellbeing outcomes in the Oral Ketamine Trial on Suicidality (OKTOS). Thirty adults with chronic suicidality participated in the trial over 10 weeks. Functional recovery and wellbeing were assessed using the Social and Occupational Functioning Scale (SOFAS) and World Health Organization Well-Being Index (WHO-5). Suicidality and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Beck Scale for Suicidal ideation (BSS) and Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Relationships between the four treatment outcomes were analysed. Forty-three percent of participants achieved healthy function (SOFAS ≥ 80) and 27% reported healthy wellbeing (WHO-5 > 60%) at the four-week post-treatment follow-up. Wellbeing was revealed as the data-derived treatment endpoint for the sample. Effect sizes for functioning and wellbeing outcomes were smaller than for suicidality and depression outcomes. Results suggest that reduction in depressive symptoms and suicidal ideation may be necessary but not sufficient for full restoration of function and wellbeing in antisuicidal and antidepressant therapy, including clinical trials."
"5788","0","Effects of ketamine, dexmedetomidine and propofol anesthesia on emotional memory consolidation in rats: Consequences for the development of post-traumatic stress disorder.^\nIntensive Care Unit (ICU) or emergency care patients, exposed to traumatic events, are at increased risk for Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) development. Commonly used sedative/anesthetic agents can interfere with the mechanisms of memory formation, exacerbating or attenuating the memory for the traumatic event, and subsequently promote or reduce the risk of PTSD development. Here, we evaluated the effects of ketamine, dexmedetomidine and propofol on fear memory consolidation and subsequent cognitive and emotional alterations related to traumatic stress exposure. Immediately following an inhibitory avoidance training, rats were intraperitoneally injected with ketamine (100–125mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (0.3-0.4mg/kg) or their vehicle and tested for 48h memory retention. Furthermore, the effects of ketamine (125mg/kg), dexmedetomidine (0.4mg/kg), propofol (300mg/kg) or their vehicle on long-term memory and social interaction were evaluated two weeks after drug injection in a rat PTSD model. Ketamine anesthesia increased memory retention without altering the traumatic memory strength in the PTSD model. However, ketamine induced a long-term reduction of social behavior. Conversely, dexmedetomidine markedly impaired memory retention, without affecting long-lasting cognitive or emotional behaviors in the PTSD model. We have previously shown that propofol anesthesia enhanced 48h memory retention. Here, we found that propofol induced an enduring traumatic memory enhancement and anxiogenic effects in the PTSD model. These findings provide new evidence for clinical studies showing that the use of ketamine or propofol anesthesia in emergency care and ICU might be more likely to promote the development of PTSD, while dexmedetomidine might have prophylactic effects.

"4023","1","Long-term follow-up outcomes of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD: a longitudinal pooled analysis of six phase 2 trials.^\nRATIONALE: Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is a chronic condition that has wide-ranging negative effects on an individual's health and interpersonal relationships. Treatments with long-term benefits are needed to promote the safety and well-being of those suffering from PTSD. OBJECTIVES: To examine long-term change in PTSD symptoms and additional benefits/harms after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy for treatment of PTSD. METHODS: Participants received two to three active doses of MDMA (75-125 mg) during blinded or open-label psychotherapy sessions with additional non-drug therapy sessions. PTSD symptoms were assessed using the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale for DSM IV (CAPS-IV) at baseline, 1 to 2 months after the last active MDMA session (treatment exit), and at least 12 months post final MDMA session (LTFU). A mixed-effect repeated-measures (MMRM) analysis assessed changes in CAPS-IV total severity scores. The number of participants who met PTSD diagnostic criteria was summarized at each time point. Participants completed a long-term follow-up questionnaire. RESULTS: There was a significant reduction in CAPS-IV total severity scores from baseline to treatment exit (LS mean (SE) = - 44.8 (2.82), p < .0001), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.58 (95% CI = 1.24, 1.91). CAPS-IV scores continued to decrease from treatment exit to LTFU (LS mean (SE) = - 5.2 (2.29), p < .05), with a Cohen's d effect size of 0.23 (95% CI = 0.04, 0.43). The number of participants who no longer met PTSD criteria increased from treatment exit (56.0%) to LTFU (67.0%). The majority of participants reported benefits, including improved relationships and well-being, and a minority reported harms from study participation. CONCLUSIONS: PTSD symptoms were reduced 1 to 2 months after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy, and symptom improvement continued at least 12 months post-treatment. Phase 3 trials are investigating this novel treatment approach in a larger sample of participants with chronic PTSD.

"7355","0","3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and Synaptic Dopamine.^\nThe aim of the present chapter is to shed light on different aspects related to synaptic dopamine and clinical effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA). MDMA is a psychoactive stimulant abused by young people worldwide. Numerous studies demonstrated circulating catecholamine concentrations increase after MDMA administration, indicating sympathetic system activation modulating psychomotor and neuroendocrine function. Its mechanism of action at synaptic terminals of the dopaminergic system is strongly similar to a cocaine-like effect attributable to an inhibition of the plasma membrane transporters for dopamine (DAT) and to an increased extracellular concentration of serotonin (5-HT). Clinical and preclinical studies have investigated the effects of repeated MDMA exposure. It produces neuroadaptive responses at both serotoninergic and dopaminergic level coherently with the development and maintenance of MDMA self-administration in some experimental animals and the development of a substance misuse in some humans. More systematic investigation in humans should be assessed, focusing on interindividual variables in MDMA pharmacokinetics-pharmacodynamics to better understand its acute specific pharmacological effects and toxicity. Despite its misuse, there is a great enthusiasm from clinicians who see the potential role of MDMA as a powerful addition to psychotherapy for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as a potential primary treatment for social dysfunction occurring in a wide range of other neuropsychiatric disorders (social anxiety, autism, schizophrenia, and alcohol use disorders). © Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022."

Findings from a proof-of-concept, randomized, controlled cross-over study of single-dose intravenous ketamine administration (compared to single-dose midazolam) in patients with chronic PTSD suggest that ketamine is associated with rapid improvement in core PTSD symptoms and comorbid depressive symptoms, and is generally well tolerated. Additional research is needed to confirm its efficacy and safety for patients with PTSD.

"5538","0","Pharmacokinetic profile of single and repeated oral doses of MDMA in squirrel monkeys: Relationship to lasting effects on brain serotonin neurons.^\nA large body of data indicates that (+/-) 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine ( MDMA, 'ecstasy') can damage brain serotonin neurons in animals. However, the relevance of these preclinical data to humans is uncertain, because doses and routes of administration used in animals have generally differed from those used by humans. Here, we examined the pharmacokinetic profile of MDMA in squirrel monkeys after different routes of administration, and explored the relationship between acute plasma MDMA concentrations after repeated oral dosing and subsequent brain serotonin deficits. Oral MDMA administration engendered a plasma profile of MDMA in squirrel monkeys resembling that seen in humans, although the half-life of MDMA in monkeys is shorter ( 3 vs 6 - 9 h). MDMA was biotransformed into MDA, and the plasma ratio of MDA to MDMA was 3 - 5/100, similar to that in humans. MDMA accumulation in squirrel monkeys was nonlinear, and plasma levels were highly correlated with regional brain serotonin deficits observed 2 weeks later. The present results indicate that plasma concentrations of MDMA shown here to produce lasting serotonergic deficits in squirrel monkeys overlap those reported by other laboratories in some recreational 'ecstasy' consumers, and are two to three times higher than those found in humans administered a single 100 - 150 mg dose of MDMA in a controlled setting. Additional studies are needed on the relative sensitivity of brain serotonin neurons to MDMA toxicity in humans and non-human primates, the pharmacokinetic parameter(s) of MDMA most closely linked to the neurotoxic process, and metabolites other than MDA that may play a role."

MDMA differs somewhat from traditional amphetamines in that it is not structurally similar to serotonin. Cocaine is rare and cannabis is consumed less frequently than in Western Europe. Heroin is the drug of choice for the poor in Bucharest, Romania’s capital of two million people, and alcoholism is common in villages where more than a third of the population lives in poverty. By far, the most popular drugs are Legal Highs (Romanians call them “ethnobotanics”). All of these drugs have significant effects on cardiovascular function that contribute significantly to adverse events. Most adverse cardiac events occur in young adults and are potentially reversible. Poisoning among patients aged 17 years and over was commonly seen in the Emergency Departments of a large tertiary hospital in the city centre, accounting for 3.2% of all patients. In a third of the poisonings, more than one substance was used. Intoxication with ethnobotanicals was the most frequently observed, followed by use of drugs from the amphetamine group. The majority of patients presenting to the Emergency Department were male. Therefore, this study suggests further research on hazardous alcohol consumption and drug abuse."
"224","1","Efficacy of esketamine in the treatment of depression with psychotic features: A case series.^\nThis small case series provides evidence of the safety and efficacy of esketamine for the treatment of treatment-resistant depression (TRD) with psychotic features. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing successful treatment of TRD with psychotic symptoms with esketamine administered subcutaneously. Ketamine has been used to induce a pharmacological model of psychosis, because it produces a syndrome consisting of disordered thought, perceptual abnormalities, blunted affect, emotional withdrawal, and memory impairments in healthy subjects. Because of that, nearly all clinical and research protocols have used the presence of psychotic symptoms as an exclusion criterion for treatment with ketamine. However, different sources of evidence have suggested that psychotic manifestations associated with ketamine are transient and clinically non significant. Although ketamine has significant perceptual effects, they are transient and usually occur at higher doses than those necessary for depression treatment. In addition, the findings of the present study are in line with previous studies reporting remission of both depressive and psychotic symptoms after treatment of patients with depression and acute psychosis or a history of psychosis. Moreover, studies examining patients with schizophrenia have demonstrated a similar dose-response pattern of psychotomimetic manifestations following low-dose ketamine administration. Notably, they experienced mild, short-lasting increases in psychotic symptoms, but these had no impact on the longterm outcome of these patients with psychosis. As previously suggested, inclusion of patients with psychotic depression in clinical trials investigating the efficacy of ketamine/esketamine should be encouraged.

Design: School districts were selected based on size and location, and then randomly assigned to a control condition or to an experimental condition in a cohort sequential design. Setting/Participants: The study included 28 public school districts in Iowa and Pennsylvania that were located in rural towns and small cities, ranging in size from 6975 to 44,510. Sixth and seventh graders in these school districts participated in the study. Intervention: Community teams were mobilized; each team implemented one of three evidence-based, family-focused interventions (5 to 12 sessions) and one of three evidence-based school interventions (11 to 15 sessions), for 6th and 7th graders, respectively. Observations showed that interventions were implemented with fidelity. Main Outcome Measures: Outcomes included student reports of past month, past year, and lifetime use of alcohol, cigarettes, marijuana, methamphetamines, ecstasy, and inhalants, as well as indices of gateway and illicit substance initiation, at pretest and at a follow-up assessment 18 months later. Results: Intent-to-treat analyses demonstrated significant effects on substance initiation (marijuana, inhalants, methamphetamines, ecstasy, gateway index, illicit-use index), as well as past-year use of marijuana and inhalants, with positive trends for all substances measured. For three outcomes, intervention effects were stronger for higher-risk students than lower-risk students.

We plan to investigate effects of these psychostimulants on emotion‐processing and cognitive performance using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) techniques. Single doses of methylphenidate (60mg), modafinil (600mg), MDMA (125mg), or placebo will be administered before an fMRI scan in a placebo‐controlled, randomized cross‐over study design in 24 healthy subjects. Subjective emotional effects, sociability, neurohormonal, cardiovascular responses, and plasma drug concentrations will also be assessed and analyzed for potential brain‐induced changes in brain activity in networks processing emotions. The primary hypothesis is that these psychostimulants differentially affect processing of emotional stimuli and potentially leading to alterations in social cognition and behavior. The work should clarify the neuropharmacological basis of the potentially differential effects of these drugs.

Given the purported role of the NMDA receptor in long-term potentiation, the primary purpose of the present study was to further understand the dose-related effects of ketamine on memory. The study was also designed to provide information about the relative effects of ketamine on memory versus nonmemory effects and to more fully characterize ketamine's overall pattern and time course of effects. Single intramuscular injections of ketamine (0.2 mg/kg, 0.4 mg/kg) were administered to 18 healthy adult volunteers using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover design. Word lists were used to evaluate episodic memory (free recall, recognition memory, source memory) and metamemory. Working memory, time estimation, psychomotor performance, and subjective effects were assessed repeatedly for 5 hours after drug administration. Ketamine selectively impaired encoding (as measured by free recall) while sparing retrieval, working memory while sparing attention, and digit symbol substitution task speed while sparing accuracy. Ketamine did not significantly impair recognition or source memory, metamemory, or time estimation. There were no hallucinations or increases in mystical experiences with ketamine. Memory measures were less sensitive to ketamine effects than subjective or psychomotor measures. Subjective effects lasted longer than memory and most psychomotor impairments. Ketamine produces selective, transient, dose- and time-related effects. In conjunction with previous studies of drugs with different mechanisms of actions, the observed selectivity of effects enhances the understanding of the pharmacological mechanisms underlying memory, attention, psychomotor performance, and subjective experience."

It is the main factor for the presence of suicidal ideation. Antidepressants show modest efficacy, and response requires several weeks. Ketamine has demonstrated a fast and robust antidepressant effect in subanesthetic doses. This effect may prove useful in patients with AC, MDD, and suicidal risk. METHOD: We report a case of a patient with advanced cervical cancer who presented with uncontrollable pain, MDD, and a suicide attempt. RESULT: A 39-year-old woman diagnosed with cervical cancer stage IVB presented to the Emergency Department after a suicide attempt by hanging. Upon evaluation by the palliative care psychiatrist, she reported intense pain, unresponsive to analgesics, and had a history of persistent suicidal ideation. Antidepressant treatment was started (sertraline 50mg/d) after a single dose of ketamine hydrochloride IV (0.5 mg/kg) was administered. Treatment response was measured using the Brief Edinburgh Depression Scale before and after the intervention. The depressive symptoms decreased by 17% on day 1, 39% on day 3, and 72% on day 17. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: This case report shows ketamine's efficacy as an augmentation agent alongside conventional antidepressant treatment in patients with AC. Moreover, it shows rapid response in suicidal ideation that has not been achieved with treatment as usual. More clinical trials are needed to support the potential benefit and safety of ketamine in patients with AC, MDD, and persisting suicidal ideation."
"5251","1","Prevalence of psilocybin use in vaping and associated factors: a study among amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) use disorder in Malaysia.^\nBackground: The emergence of New Psychoactive Substances (NPS), including synthetic psilocybin, has raised concern among health experts due to the numerous health and socioeconomic consequences. The current trend is shifting to the hazardous use of synthetic psilocybin in vaping, and little is known about the prevalence of use, specifically among amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) users. Methods: Interviewer-administered questionnaires were conducted in drug detention centers between March and October 2022. The study was conducted using ASSIST 3.0 and obtained information on the respondents’ socio-demographic characteristics and clinical profiles. N = 355 ATS users were enrolled in this study. Results: The results show a high prevalence of psilocybin vaping among ATS users (182/355, 53.1%). Most of the respondents were males (85.1%) and unmarried (69.3%), with a mean age of 29.2 (SD = 7.3). Across all respondents, five factors were associated with psilocybin vaping: tobacco smoking, aOR =5.790 (95% CI: 1.723, 8.183); cannabis uses, aOR= 9.152 (95% CI: 2.693, 10.396); and alcohol use, aOR= 3.137 (95% CI: 1.461, 5.817). Respondents of the Malay race had higher odds of being involved in psilocybin vaping compared to other races, with aOR= 1.638 (0.043, 2.459). Meanwhile, a reduction in age by 1.9 will increase the likelihood of involvement in psilocybin vaping with aOR = 1.897 (95% CI: 0.857, 1.938). Conclusion: Psilocybin in vaping is growing among ATS users and across all populations. Unfortunately, knowledge regarding the long-term effects on health is limited. Further studies should highlight the harmful effects of psilocybin and the potential risk of psilocybin vaping among the younger population."
"5738","1","The Effects of MDMA and Methamphetamine on Feelings of Closeness and Connection During Semi-Structured Conversations With Strangers.^\nBackground: MDMA is classified as an “empathogenic” drug, as it increases feelings of empathy and closeness to others. These effects are thought to be partly mediated by increased oxytocin release via enhanced serotonergic transmission. Despite its prosocial effects, few studies in humans have examined MDMA in the context of interpersonal interactions. The objectives of this study were to determine the effects of MDMA on feelings of closeness and connection during a semi‐structured dyadic conversation, and to investigate the relations between feelings of closeness and oxytocin levels. To investigate pharmacological specificity, a separate group of subjects was tested with the prototypic stimulant methamphetamine. Methods: Two studies were conducted in separate sets of healthy volunteers. In within‐subject, double‐blind, placebocontrolled designs, subjects aged 18‐35 received a single dose of MDMA (100 mg) or placebo (Study 1; n = 18), or a single dose of methamphetamine (20 mg) or placebo (Study 2; n = 19), during two in‐lab sessions separated by 72 hours. During peak drug effect, they engaged in a 45 min semi‐structured conversation with a novel same‐sex partner. Subjective mood, physiological, and oxytocin levels were obtained at regular intervals, and subjects rated feelings of closeness and connection with their partners at the end of each session and one week later. Results: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased ratings of feeling connected to the partner, and increased ratings of enjoyment and meaningfulness of the conversation, relative to placebo (Study 1 MDMA; p=0.009 and Study 2 methamphetamine p=0.01). Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased subjective ratings of “sociable,” “loving,” and “friendly.” Only MDMA increased ratings of “trusting,” “grateful,” and “appreciated,” and only methamphetamine increased ratings of “understood” MDMA (p=0.001), and to a lesser extent methamphetamine (p=0.02) increased salivary oxytocin levels. Notably, oxytocin levels were positively correlated with feelings of closeness after MDMA but not after methamphetamine (Study 1; r=0.52, p=0.03). Conclusions: Both MDMA and methamphetamine increased feelings of closeness and connection to strangers during controlled interpersonal interactions, and both drugs increased subjective ratings of sociability. However, these feelings were related to oxytocin only after MDMA, suggesting that the mechanisms mediating prosocial effects may differ across drugs. This study provides a model for future studies assessing effects of drugs on interpersonal interactions."
"6529","0","Tripping on nothing: placebo psychedelics and contextual factors.^\nRATIONALE: Is it possible to have a psychedelic experience from a placebo alone? Most psychedelic studies find few effects in the placebo control group, yet these effects may have been obscured by the study design, setting, or analysis decisions. OBJECTIVE: We examined individual variation in placebo effects in a naturalistic environment resembling a typical psychedelic party. METHODS: Thirty-three students completed a single-arm study ostensibly examining how a psychedelic drug affects creativity. The 4-h study took place in a group setting with music, paintings, coloured lights, and visual projections. Participants consumed a placebo that we described as a drug resembling psilocybin, which is found in psychedelic mushrooms. To boost expectations, confederates subtly acted out the stated effects of the drug and participants were led to believe that there was no placebo control group. The participants later completed the 5-Dimensional Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale, which measures changes in conscious experience. RESULTS: There was considerable individual variation in the placebo effects; many participants reported no changes while others showed effects with magnitudes typically associated with moderate or high doses of psilocybin. In addition, the majority (61%) of participants verbally reported some effect of the drug. Several stated that they saw the paintings on the walls ""move"" or ""reshape"" themselves, others felt ""heavy… as if gravity [had] a stronger hold"", and one had a ""come down"" before another ""wave"" hit her. CONCLUSION: Understanding how context and expectations promote psychedelic-like effects, even without the drug, will help researchers to isolate drug effects and clinicians to maximise their therapeutic potential."
"1467","1","Comparative epidemiology of betel nut use versus ecstasy use among Taiwanese adolescents: findings from a national survey.^\nAIMS: To investigate whether variation may exist in betel nut- and ecstasy-involved adolescents in terms of sociobehavioral characteristics, the experience of psychoactive substance use, and behavioral/emotional problems. METHODS: Students (n = 53,528) aged 12-18 sampled via stratified, multistage, random cluster sampling in 2004, 2005, and 2006 throughout Taiwan were categorized into four groups: betel nut- and ecstasy-naïve (n = 51,009), betel nut use only (n = 1965), ecstasy use only (n = 196), and use of both (n = 152). Participants completed a questionnaire with information on sociodemographic features, substance-use experiences, and the Chinese adaptation of the Youth Self Report. RESULTS: Having a job, a larger weekly allowance, truancy, sexual experience, and externalizing behaviors were all in strong association with the involvement of either betel nut or ecstasy use. Compared with ecstasy-only users, betel nut-only users were more likely to be male, from the Eastern region of Taiwan, with initiation motivated by family members or friends, and having excess risks for Anxiety/Depression, Thought Problems, and Attention Problems. In contrast, ecstasy-only users were more likely to be female and involved in using other illegal drugs, with their initiation motivated by entertainment and with the drug use taking place in such settings. CONCLUSIONS: The variation in the experience of psychoactive substance use and behavioral problems for betel nut and ecstasy users suggests the existence of subgroups of drug-using adolescents in Taiwan. The identification of such heterogeneity may guide the efforts to reduce substance use and develop subgroup-tailored preventive programs."
"8249","1","Effects of ketamine on brain function during response inhibition.^\nINTRODUCTION: The uncompetitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Inhibitory deficits in the schizophrenia spectrum have been reliably reported using the antisaccade task. Interestingly, although similar antisaccade deficits have been reported following ketamine in non-human primates, ketamine-induced deficits have not been observed in healthy human volunteers. METHODS: To investigate the effects of ketamine on brain function during an antisaccade task, we conducted a double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subjects study on n = 15 healthy males. We measured the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) response and eye movements during a mixed antisaccade/prosaccade task while participants received a subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine (target plasma level 100 ng/ml) on one occasion and placebo on the other occasion. RESULTS: While ketamine significantly increased self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences, it did not induce antisaccade or prosaccade performance deficits. At the level of BOLD, we observed an interaction between treatment and task condition in somatosensory cortex, suggesting recruitment of additional neural resources in the antisaccade condition under NMDAR blockage. DISCUSSION: Given the robust evidence of antisaccade deficits in schizophrenia spectrum populations, the current findings suggest that ketamine may not mimic all features of psychosis at the dose used in this study. Our findings underline the importance of a more detailed research to further understand and define effects of NMDAR hypofunction on human brain function and behavior, with a view to applying ketamine administration as a model system of psychosis. Future studies with varying doses will be of importance in this context."
"5972","0","Reliability of three versus five saliva sampling times for assessing the cortisol awakening response.^\nThe cortisol awakening response (CAR) describes the sharp increase in cortisol secretion within 60 min after awakening. A summary of the CAR, the area under the cortisol curve above the awakening cortisol value (AUCi) is a widely used biomarker in health research. Estimation of the AUCi rely on a number of collected salivary samples at fixed time intervals (i.e., 5 samples in 15 min intervals) starting from awakening. Little empirical work has been executed to investigate the impact of reducing sampling times on AUCi estimation, which could potentially improve participant compliance and reduce operational costs. This study aimed to assess the reli-ability and validity of using 3-sample AUCi versus 5-sample AUCi, i.e., systematic and random fluctuations based on a large dataset from healthy and case individuals (total n = 537). We showed that the ideal timing of 3 -sam-pling times was 0-30-60 min with a median difference in AUCi of -8 nmol*h/L and interquartile range of 65 nmol*h/L among healthy individuals, and -12 nmol*h/L and 78 nmol*h/L among case individuals. We sub-sequently validated the 3-sample AUCi by re-analyzing three published association studies. Overall, we obtained similar p-values with 3-sample AUCi when compared to 5-sample AUCi, while smaller effect sizes and standard errors were observed. In conclusion, despite a less precise estimation of the AUCi itself, our data support that the AUC measure of the CAR, based on three samples collected at 0-30-60 min from awakening, provides reliable results in association studies."
"3389","1","Subjective and hormonal effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans.^\nRATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used phenethylamine. Reports have described the effects of MDMA in a controlled laboratory setting, but the full range of effects of MDMA in humans is still not completely characterized. OBJECTIVES: To describe the physiological, subjective, and hormonal changes after single doses of MDMA in a laboratory setting and examine relationships between these effects. METHODS: Eight MDMA-experienced volunteers each received placebo, 0.5 mg/kg, and 1.5 mg/kg oral doses of MDMA in a double-blind crossover study. RESULTS: The 1.5 mg/kg dose (comparable to that typically used by most participants) produced significant subjective effects, peaking at about 2 h after dosing, including some effects commonly associated with stimulant drugs, hallucinogens, and entactogens. MDMA significantly increased plasma cortisol, prolactin, and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) levels. Increase in plasma cortisol after the 1.5 mg/kg dose correlated with increased heart rate, rate-pressure product, and drug liking. Rise in DHEA correlated with euphoria. CONCLUSIONS: A typically used dose of MDMA produced effects commonly associated with stimulants and hallucinogens. Subjects liked MDMA. Correlations between cortisol and DHEA levels and some physiological and psychological effects are consistent with animal data suggesting that hormones modulate some responses to drugs of abuse."
"71","1","The effects of ketamine on prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission in healthy and depressed subjects.^\nThe ability of ketamine administration to activate prefrontal glutamate neurotransmission is thought to be a key mechanism contributing to its transient psychotomimetic effects and its delayed and sustained antidepressant effects. Rodent studies employing carbon-13 magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((13)C MRS) methods have shown ketamine and other N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonists to transiently increase measures reflecting glutamate-glutamine cycling and glutamate neurotransmission in the frontal cortex. However, there are not yet direct measures of glutamate neurotransmission in vivo in humans to support these hypotheses. The current first-level pilot study employed a novel prefrontal (13)C MRS approach similar to that used in the rodent studies for direct measurement of ketamine effects on glutamate-glutamine cycling. Twenty-one participants (14 healthy and 7 depressed) completed two (13)C MRS scans during infusion of normal saline or subanesthetic doses of ketamine. Compared to placebo, ketamine increased prefrontal glutamate-glutamine cycling, as indicated by a 13% increase in (13)C glutamine enrichment (t = 2.4, p = 0.02). We found no evidence of ketamine effects on oxidative energy production, as reflected by (13)C glutamate enrichment. During ketamine infusion, the ratio of (13)C glutamate/glutamine enrichments, a putative measure of neurotransmission strength, was correlated with the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (r = -0.54, p = 0.048). These findings provide the most direct evidence in humans to date that ketamine increases glutamate release in the prefrontal cortex, a mechanism previously linked to schizophrenia pathophysiology and implicated in the induction of rapid antidepressant effects."
"6212","1","Clinical Predictors of Intravenous Ketamine Response in Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nStudy Design: This will be a randomized, double‐blinded, midazolam‐controlled crossover trial. There is no perfect control agent for studies of subanaesthetic IV ketamine, but midazolam is generally thought to be superior to normal saline since it is not an antidepressant, yet is psychoactive and thus should better preserve blinding. Patients will undergo psychiatric assessment to establish diagnosis and determine suitability. After providing informed consent for participation, the day before infusion (Day ‐1), participants will complete a set of rating scales. The following day (Day 0), the participants will receive either a single infusion of IV ketamine (KET) (KET; 0.5mg/kg over 40 minutes) or midazolam (MID) (MID; 30μg/kg over 40 minutes). We will randomize infusion sequences in a 1‐to‐1 ratio: KET followed by MID (K→M) or vice versa (M→K). Infusions will be administered on Day 0 and Day 21, separated by a 20‐day washout period. This duration balances the need to establish comparable baselines at each crossover phase and the ethical consideration of not allowing depressive symptoms to remain untreated for an unreasonable amount of time. We will obtain objective depression ratings with the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) on Days ‐1, 1, 7, 14, 20, 22, 28, 35, and 41. Patients will provide daily self‐ratings of depressive symptoms (using the quick inventory of depressive symptoms 16‐item self‐rated version; QIDS 16‐SR). Daily symptom monitoring will continue for 20 days following the second infusion. Study Groups: Participants will receive either (A) 0.5mg/kg of ketamine hydrochloride or (B) 30μg/kg of MID diluted in 0.9 percent Sodium chloride (NaCl) over 40 minutes by an intravenous pump. The KET and MID doses are similar to those used in previous studies, and selected to minimize the possibility of unblinding. Participants must abstain from consuming grapefruit juice or benzodiazepines for 24 hours preceding the infusion since the former is a potent CYP3A4 inhibitor that may reduce the rate of midazolam and ketamine elimination, and the latter reduces the response to ketamine."
"9235","1","Effects of psilocybin on time perception and temporal control of behaviour in humans.^\nHallucinogenic psilocybin is known to alter the subjective experience of time. However, there is no study that systematically investigated objective measures of time perception under psilocybin. Therefore, we studied dose-dependent effects of the serotonin (5-HT)2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (4-phosphoryloxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine) on temporal processing, employing tasks of temporal reproduction, sensorimotor synchronization and tapping tempo. To control for cognitive and subjective changes, we assessed spatial working memory and conscious experience. Twelve healthy human volunteers were tested under placebo, medium (115 microg/kg), and high (250 microg/kg) dose conditions, in a double-blind experimental design. Psilocybin was found to significantly impair subjects' ability to (1) reproduce interval durations longer than 2.5 sec, (2) to synchronize to inter-beat intervals longer than 2 sec and (3) caused subjects to be slower in their preferred tapping rate. These objective effects on timing performance were accompanied by working-memory deficits and subjective changes in conscious state, namely increased reports of 'depersonalization' and 'derealization' phenomena including disturbances in subjective 'time sense.' Our study is the first to systematically assess the impact of psilocybin on timing performance on standardized measures of temporal processing. Results indicate that the serotonin system is selectively involved in duration processing of intervals longer than 2 to 3 seconds and in the voluntary control of the speed of movement. We speculate that psilocybin's selective disruption of longer intervals is likely to be a product of interactions with cognitive dimensions of temporal processing -presumably via 5-HT2A receptor stimulation."
"755","0","Ketamine for Bipolar Depression: Biochemical, Psychotherapeutic, and Psychedelic Approaches.^\nBipolar disorder (type 1) is a serious and chronic psychiatric illness that can be difficult to treat. Many bipolar patients have refractory depressive episodes. Racemic ketamine, a glutamate modulator with prominent dissociate and psychedelic properties, has been demonstrated to have rapid acting antidepressant and anti-obsessional effects which may be useful for treating the symptoms of bipolar depression. Most of the existing research literature on unipolar and bipolar depression has looked at racemic ketamine in the sub-psychedelic dose range given by infusion as a stand-alone treatment (without concurrent psychotherapy). This article expands on the existing research by articulating three different paradigms for ketamine treatment: biochemical, psychotherapeutic, and psychedelic. The authors use composite clinical vignettes to illustrate different ways of working with ketamine to treat bipolar depression, and discuss a variety of clinical considerations for using ketamine with this population, including route, dose, frequency, chemical mitigators, and adverse events. Note that the conceptual paradigms could be applied to any ketamine treatment, with broad applicability beyond bipolar treatment."
"3778","1","Carvedilol inhibits the cardiostimulant and thermogenic effects of MDMA in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The use of ± 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') is associated with cardiovascular complications and hyperthermia. EXPERIMENTAL APPROACH: We assessed the effects of the α(1) - and β-adrenoceptor antagonist carvedilol on the cardiostimulant, thermogenic and subjective responses to MDMA in 16 healthy subjects. Carvedilol (50 mg) or placebo was administered 1 h before MDMA (125 mg) or placebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, four-period crossover design. KEY RESULTS Carvedilol reduced MDMA-induced elevations in blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature. Carvedilol did not affect the subjective effects of MDMA including MDMA-induced good drug effects, drug high, drug liking, stimulation or adverse effects. Carvedilol did not alter the plasma exposure to MDMA. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: α(1) - and β-Adrenoceptors contribute to the cardiostimulant and thermogenic effects of MDMA in humans but not to its psychotropic effects. Carvedilol could be useful in the treatment of cardiovascular and hyperthermic complications associated with ecstasy use."
"5887","1","Using a multimodal biomarker approach to identify functional target engagement of the novel NMDA positive allosteric modulator SAGE-718.^\nBackground: NMDA receptor hypofunction has been linked to a range of clinical phenomena, including cognitive dysfunction, motivational deficits, and alterations in social behavior. Potential treatments for conditions characterized by these symptoms may require enhancement of NMDA receptor‐related neurotransmission. A novel class of compounds‐positive allosteric modulators of the NMDA receptor (NMDA‐PAMs)‐are being developed for this purpose. The clinical development path for compounds with novel mechanisms of action is substantially de‐risked by characterizing functional CNS target engagement. Ketamine is a glutamate antagonist that has been shown to induce changes in brain activity via the NMDA receptor. Given this, a suite of Phase 1 target engagement studies was designed to evaluate CNS‐target engagement of SAGE‐718, an investigational NMDA‐PAM, by electrophysiology and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), using a low‐dose ketamine challenge paradigm. Methods: Based on the hypothesis that an NMDA‐PAM would attenuate ketamine‐induced changes in healthy volunteers, a lowdose ketamine challenge paradigm was employed. Two paradigms were selected based on a single administration of SAGE‐718 (3mg oral solution) vs. placebo in a randomized cross‐over design, with a wash‐out of approximately 10 days. In the first study, subjects underwent MRI approximately 6.5 hours after the SAGE‐718 or placebo dose to obtain a baseline assessment. Ketamine (0.25mg/kg) was then administered as an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes starting approximately 7 hours after each dose of SAGE‐718 or placebo. During the infusion, a second MRI assessment was completed. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) derived changes of the blood oxygenation level (BOLD) response and functional connectivity between regions of interest were recorded (n = 13, completed subjects with valid data). In the second study to determine the effects of SAGE‐718 vs placebo, electrophysiological parameters were assessed starting approximately 6 hours after the administration of SAGE‐718 or placebo and approximately one hour before the administration of ketamine. A second assessment was done during the 60 min ketamine infusion. The following parameters were measured; ketamine‐induced changes in single click auditory evoked potential (AEP, N100‐P200), mismatch negativity (MMN), and auditory steady state response (ASSR) (n =18 completed subjects with valid data). Safety was assessed by adverse event reporting, standard clinical assessments, the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale, the Clinician Administered Dissociative State Scale, Observer's Assessment of Alertness and Sedation (OAAS), and the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale. Results: Ketamine‐induced BOLD changes were broad, including robust increases in posterior brain regions and decreases in anterior brain regions, in particular the pre‐specified dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (dACC). SAGE‐718 attenuated ketamineinduced BOLD alterations independent of their directionality. N100‐P200 was significantly reduced by ketamine under placebo conditions (p < 0.05), but not after administration of SAGE‐718. No ketamine‐induced significant changes were observed for mismatch negativity (MMN) and auditory steady state response (ASSR) under any condition. SAGE‐718 was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events or deaths. Treatment emergent adverse events (TEAEs) reported after SAGE‐718 administration (but before ketamine administration) were mild and infrequent, including headache (n = 1 in each of the studies) and fatigue (n = 1) in the evoked potential study. No TEAEs resulted in discontinuation or dose reduction of SAGE‐718, and no significant changes in clinical chemistry, hematology, urinalysis, or ECGS were observed. Conclusions: Results from these studies demonstrate that SAGE‐718 had effects on functional imaging in healthy volunteers. SAGE‐718 also modulated the effects of ketamine on regional and global measures of resting brain activity These effects are in line with the presumed mechanism of action of SAGE‐718 as an NMDA‐PAM, which supports the hypothesis of functional engagement of the NMDA receptor. These data, in addition to safety data collected to date, support further investigation of SAGE‐718 in disorders characterized by hypoactivity at the NMDA receptor."
"1804","1","Cocaine self-administration disrupted by the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine: a randomized, crossover trial.^\nRepeated drug consumption may progress to problematic use by triggering neuroplastic adaptations that attenuate sensitivity to natural rewards while increasing reactivity to craving and drug cues. Converging evidence suggests a single sub-anesthetic dose of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine may work to correct these neuroadaptations and restore motivation for non-drug rewards. Using an established laboratory model aimed at evaluating behavioral shifts in the salience of cocaine now vs money later, we found that ketamine, as compared to the control, significantly decreased cocaine self-administration by 67% relative to baseline at greater than 24 h post-infusion, the most robust reduction observed to date in human cocaine users and the first to involve mechanisms other than stimulant or dopamine agonist effects. These findings signal new directions in medication development for substance use disorders."
"5371","1","Medication development of ibogaine as a pharmacotherapy for drug dependence.^\nThe potential for deriving new psychotherapeutic medications from natural sources has led to renewal interest in rain forest plants as a source of lead compounds for the development of antiaddiction medications. Ibogaine is an indole alkaloid found in the roots of Tabernanthe iboga (Apocynaceae family), a rain forest shrub that is native to equatorial Africa. Ibogaine is used by indigenous peoples in low doses to combat fatigue, hunger and in higher doses as a sacrament in religious rituals. Members of American and European addict self-help groups have claimed that ibogaine promotes long-term drug abstinence from addictive substances, including psychostimulants and cocaine. Anecdotal reports attest that a single dose of ibogaine eliminates withdrawal symptoms and reduces drug cravings for extended periods of time. The purported antiaddictive properties of ibogaine require rigorous validation in humans. We have initiated a rising tolerance study using single administration to assess the safety of ibogaine for treatment of cocaine dependency. The primary objectives of the study are to determine safety, pharmacokinetics and dose effects, and to identify relevant parameters of efficacy in cocaine-dependent patients. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic characteristics of ibogaine in humans are assessed by analyzing the concentration-time data of ibogaine and its desmethyl metabolite (noribogaine) from the Phase I trial, and by conducting in vitro experiments to elucidate the specific disposition processes involved in the metabolism of both parent drug and metabolite. The development of clinical safety studies of ibogaine in humans will help to determine whether there is a rationale for conducting efficacy trials in the future."
"8483","1","Lack of effect of ketamine on cortical glutamate and glutamine in healthy volunteers: a proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy study.^\nKetamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) antagonist that has been associated with temporary clinical improvement in patients with depression. Studies using magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) have shown that major depression is associated with decreased levels of glutamate and glutamine (Glx) in the anterior cingulate cortex, which normalize with clinical recovery. The present study aimed to test whether a ketamine infusion would increase cortical Glx levels in healthy volunteers. Healthy volunteers received an intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg kg⁻¹, n = 8) or saline (n = 9) over 40 minutes. MRS measurements were obtained at baseline, during, and at the end of the infusion. The infusion of ketamine had significant effects on mental state but there was no effect of ketamine on the levels of Glx (F (3,39) = 1.70, p = 0.18) or glutamate (F (3,39) = 48, p = 0.70). This study suggests that the gradual infusion of low-dose ketamine in antidepressant doses not cause changes in cortical glutamate or glutamine in healthy volunteers that are visible by proton MRS."

"9472","1","Attentional processes in abstinent methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) users.^\nIn recent years, methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) has gained great popularity among young adults. Although human research in abstinent users has focused primarily on memory function, little attention has been given to other neuropsychological functions that may have some bearing on memory performance, such as attention. Hence, the purpose of this study was to examine the effects of MDMA on attentional processes. Accordingly, 24 MDMA users and 30 matched normal controls were tested on the Wechsler Abbreviated Scale of Intelligence (WASI) and the Test of Everyday Attention (TEA). We found MDMA users to show generally no significant difference on attention tasks compared with controls with the exception of a single TEA subtest. More interestingly, we found some preliminary evidence to indicate that dosage, in terms of the number of tablets used, may be related to impairment on specific component attentional tasks. This finding brings to light the important relationship between poor attentional processes and drug-taking behaviors and their reciprocal relationship."
"9040","1","Visuospatial memory impairments in users of MDMA ('ecstasy').^\nRATIONALE: Previous studies have presented conflicting findings regarding visuospatial span deficits in MDMA ('ecstasy') users, possibly attributable to a lack of distinction between simple visuospatial span and visuospatial working memory span. Both draw upon central executive processing, while the latter also involves concurrent goal-orientated visuospatial processing. OBJECTIVES: This study compared visuospatial working memory span for MDMA users and controls. An additional concurrent task also loading on the central executive tested for inter-group differences related to central executive workload. METHOD: MDMA user group (25 current users, 10 previous users and 18 non-users) was between-participants, and dual task condition (concurrent alphabetic generation, random letter generation, and no dual task) was within-participants. The visuospatial working memory task required participants to serially recall a spatial sequence while simultaneously completing a visual judgement task, and was completed on its own and under dual task conditions. RESULTS: Overall, non-users performed significantly better than both MDMA user groups. However, contrary to expectation, the performance decrement among users was no worse with concurrent random generation than under control conditions. Analyses controlling for background variables and the use of other drugs in the previous 3 months showed that the main effect of MDMA remained significant following control for intelligence, alcohol, amphetamines and cocaine, among other potential confounds. Unclear results were found following control for cannabis use. CONCLUSIONS: The MDMA users experienced deficits in visuospatial working memory span. The lack of interaction between dual task condition and user group may be due to inter-group differences in central executive utilisation under different task conditions."
"5621","1","Ayahuasca's Antidepressant Effects Covary with Behavioral Activation as Well as Mindfulness.^\nAyahuasca, a plant-based hallucinogen that serves as a spiritual medicine in South America, has improved depression in at least one placebo-controlled clinical trial. Case studies suggest that dramatic behavioral changes often follow the Ayahuasca ceremony, but most explanations of antidepressant effects focus on changes in mindfulness. This study investigated whether both mindfulness and behavioral activation might contribute to these anti-depressant effects. We surveyed individuals (N = 152) about their changes in depressive symptoms, behavioral activation, and mindfulness after an Ayahuasca experience. Mindfulness was strongly associated with reduced depression severity (r = - .670, p < .001), while behavioral activation was moderately linked (r = - .474, p < .001). Changes in depressive symptoms (Center for Epidemiological Sciences Depression Short Form [CES-D-10]) covaried with subscales from the Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire [FFMQ] and Experiences Questionnaire [EQ], confirming previous findings (β = -.57, 95% CI -5.70, -3.25), p < .001). In addition, a modification of the Behavioral Activation for Depression Scale-Short Form [BADS-SF] accounted for significant unique variance in the improvements in depression (β = - .16, 95% CI -6.32, -0.08), p < .05). Changes in behavioral activation likely serve as a mechanism underlying Ayahuasca's antidepressant effects. Future clinical trials could benefit from tracking behavioral activation."

Both of these events were deemed not attributable to the administration of a psychedelic by the authors of the primary outcome trials. One completed suicide was reported by Griffiths et al. (2016) 11 days following the administration of a very low dose (placebo-like) of psilocybin (1 mg/70 kg psilocybin). Importantly, this individual was not administered an “active” dose of psilocybin during the course of the study.1 One suicide attempt was reported by Anderson et al. (2020) approximately 2 months after the administration of an active dose of psilocybin (21−25.2 mg/70 kg).2 For further details, see the supporting information of the respective manuscripts. Although these events are likely not attributable to psychedelic therapy itself, they point to the importance of closely attending to safety within psychedelic therapy and research."
"8923","1","Single-dose psilocybin-assisted therapy in major depressive disorder: A placebo-controlled, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin has been suggested as a novel, rapid-acting treatment for depression. Two consecutive doses have been shown to markedly decrease symptom severity in an open-label setting or when compared to a waiting list group. To date, to our knowledge, no other trial compared a single, moderate dose of psilocybin to a placebo condition. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomised clinical trial, 52 participants diagnosed with major depressive disorder and no unstable somatic conditions were allocated to receive either a single, moderate dose (0.215 mg/kg body weight) of psilocybin or placebo in conjunction with psychological support. MADRS and BDI scores were assessed to estimate depression severity, while changes from baseline to 14 days after the intervention were defined as primary endpoints. The trial took place between April 11th, 2019 and October 12th, 2021 at the psychiatric university hospital in Zürich, Switzerland and was registered with clinicaltrials.gov (NCT03715127). FINDINGS: The psilocybin condition showed an absolute decrease in symptom severity of -13.0 points compared to baseline and were significantly larger than those in the placebo condition (95% CI -15.0 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.97; P = 0.0011; MADRS) and -13.2 points (95% CI; -13.4 to -1.3; Cohens' d = 0.67; P = 0.019; BDI) 14 days after the intervention. 14/26 (54%) participants met the MADRS remission criteria in the psilocybin condition. INTERPRETATION: These results suggest that a single, moderate dose of psilocybin significantly reduces depressive symptoms compared to a placebo condition for at least two weeks. No serious adverse events were recorded. Larger, multi-centric trials with longer follow-up periods are needed to inform further optimisation of this novel treatment paradigm. FUNDING: The study was funded by the Swiss National Science Foundation, Crowdfunding, the Swiss Neuromatrix Foundation, and the Heffter Research Institute."
"8177","1","Clinical and neurophysiological biomarkers of ketamine's antidepressant effect in major depressive disorder patients.^\nBackground: Ketamine, a non‐competitive antagonist of NMDA (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate) receptors, produce a unique rapid antidepressant‐like effect [1] but its influence on theta cordance is still unknown. A series of clinical studies demonstrated that QEEG prefrontal theta cordance value decreases after one week of treatment in responders to antidepressants and precedes clinical improvement [2]. To date wasn't studied predictive value of cordance in response to single infusion of ketamine in depressive subjects. We hypothesized in our study that the changes in prefrontal cordance 24 hours after the infusion will predict sustained antidepressant response fourth day after the infusion. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Methods: In a double‐blind, cross‐over, randomized, placebocontrolled experiment we studied the influence of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg) on theta cordance in a group of 27 right‐handed hospitalized depressive patients on stable antidepressant medication. Antidepressant response was defined as 50% decrease of depressive symptoms evaluated fourth and seventh day after infusion by means of Montgomery‐Asberg Depressive Rating Scale (MADRS). Psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale before and after the infusion [3]. Three EEG segments obtained before, after the infusion and 24 hours after the dosing were entered into spectral analyses. QEEG cordance values in theta frequency band were calculated according to UCLA algorithm from three prefrontal electrodes (Fz, Fp1, Fp2). Results: Responders (n = 11) to ketamine in compare to nonresponders (n = 16) showed significant difference in cordance values at the end of ketamine infusion (Spearman, p = 0.039). The cordance decrease, measured between the end of infusion and next day, positively correlated with ketamine antidepressant response (MADRS decrease) fourth day after infusion (twotailed Fisher's Exact test, df = 1, p = 0.0076) with NPV 90.9% (95% CI 64.3‐99.5%) and PPV 62.5% (95% CI 44.2‐68.4%). Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen's d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor‐ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. Conclusions: The reduction in theta prefrontal cordance could serve as a marker of ketamine's sustained antidepressant response, a hypothesis that should be tested in larger depressive population. The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. Our data indicate that ketamine (glutamatergic‐based drug) infusion immediately induces similar changes as monoaminergic‐based antidepressants do gradually after a series of downstream signalling steps."
"8953","1","Combining Cognitive-Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for PTSD with 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA): A Case Example.^\nTreatments for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) have evolved significantly in the past 35 years. From what was historically viewed as a pervasive, intractable condition have emerged multiple evidence-based intervention options. These treatments, predominantly cognitive behavioral in orientation, provide significant symptom improvement in 50-60% of recipients. The treatment of PTSD with MDMA-assisted psychotherapy using a supportive, non-directive approach has yielded promising results. It is unknown, however, how different therapeutic modalities could impact or improve outcomes. Therefore, to capitalize on the strengths of both approaches, Cognitive Behavioral Conjoint Therapy for PTSD (CBCT) was combined with MDMA in a small pilot trial. The current article provides a case study of one couple involved in the trial, chosen to provide a demographically representative example of the study participants and a case with a severe trauma history, to offer a detailed account of the methodology and choices made to integrate CBCT and MDMA, as well as an account of their experience through the treatment and their treatment gains. This article offers a description of the combination of CBCT for PTSD and MDMA, and demonstrates that it can produce reductions in PTSD symptoms and improvements in relationship satisfaction."

We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal ketamine for BTP in a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial. Twenty patients with chronic pain and at least two spontaneous BTP episodes daily self-administered up to five doses of intranasal ketamine or placebo at the onset of a spontaneous BTP episode (pain intensity ≥ 5 on a 0-10 scale). Two BTP episodes at least 48 h apart were treated with either ketamine or placebo. Patients reported significantly lower BTP intensity following intranasal ketamine than after placebo (P < 0.0001), with pain relief within 10 min of dosing and lasting for up to 60 min. No patient in the ketamine group required his/her usual rescue medication to treat the BTP episode, while seven out of 20 (35%) patients in placebo group did (P=0.0135). Intranasal ketamine was well tolerated with no serious adverse events. After ketamine administration, four patients reported a transient change in taste, one patient reported rhinorrhea, one patient reported nasal passage irritation, and two patients experienced transient elevation in blood pressure. A side effect questionnaire administered 60 min and 24 h after drug or placebo administration elicited no reports of auditory or visual hallucinations. These data suggest that intranasal administration of ketamine provides rapid, safe and effective relief for BTP. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"4241","1","10.4 COMPARISON OF IMPLICIT AND EXPLICIT MEASURES OF PSYCHIATRIC SYMPTOMS AFTER KETAMINE TREATMENT IN ADOLESCENTS WITH MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISORDER.^\nObjectives: MDD is a significant pediatric health problem associated with morbidity and mortality. Prior studies have shown that ketamine is an effective treatment for adults with MDD, but little research has been conducted with pediatric MDD populations. In adults, implicit association tests (IATs) have demonstrated sensitivity to mental health changes as correlated with explicit measures on psychiatric scales. Comparing explicit and implicit measures following ketamine treatment in adolescents may illuminate the breadth of treatment response. Methods: A double blind, midazolam‐controlled, crossover study was performed (n = 17) in which subjects received 1 infusion of either ketamine or midazolam, given in random order, spaced 2 weeks apart. Participants completed the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS), Children’s Depression Rating Scale‐Revised (CDRS‐R), Multidimensional Anxiety Scale for Children Second Edition (MASC 2) at 1 day following treatment. A subset of participants (n = 12) took IATs at baseline and 1‐day postinfusion. Four measurements were evaluated using IATs: 1) depression; 2) suicide/death; 3) self‐harm; and 4) anxiety. D scores from the 1‐day postinfusion IATs for all 4 IAT measurements were compared with explicit rating scales and subscales. Results: Significant changes were found from both the implicit and explicit measures after ketamine infusion. Ketamine treatment reduced D scores compared to midazolam treatment for the depression IAT (p = 0.053) with an effect size of 0.65. There was also a trend toward a reduced D score for the suicide/death IAT, with an effect size of 0.50. Ketamine significantly reduced the MADRS scores (15.44 ± 10.07; 95% CI, 10.51 to 20.37) compared to midazolam (24.13 ± 12.08; 95% CI, 18.21 to 30.04), with a mean difference of –8.69 ± 15.08 (95% CI, –16.72 to –0.65; df = 15; p = 0.036). Correlation analysis between implicit measures (IATs) and explicit measures (MADRS, CDRS‐R, MASC 2, and MADRS item 10) are ongoing. Conclusions: We have demonstrated significant movement on both the implicit and explicit measures. It is critical to assess the relationship between implicit and explicit measures of depression, anxiety, and suicidal thinking as clinical trials seek to improve upon sole reliance on subjective reports.

"8302","0","Influence of aripiprazole pretreatment on the reinforcing effects of methamphetamine in humans.^\nMethamphetamine use disorders remain a significant public health concern. Methamphetamine produces its behavioral effects by facilitating release of monoamines like dopamine (DA) and serotonin (5-HT). Results from animal studies show that acute pretreatment with DA and 5-HT antagonists attenuates the effects of methamphetamine, but this area remains largely unexplored in humans. This study sought to assess whether aripiprazole, a partial agonist at D2/5-HT1A receptors and an antagonist at 5-HT2A receptors, would attenuate the reinforcing and subject-rated effects of oral methamphetamine. Seven subjects with histories of recreational stimulant use completed a placebo-controlled, crossover, double-blind protocol in which they first sampled doses of oral methamphetamine (0, 4, 8 or 16 mg) following acute pretreatment with aripiprazole (0 and 15 mg). During each Sampling Session, subjects also completed a battery of subject-rated, cardiovascular, and other performance measures. In subsequent Self-Administration Sessions, subjects were provided the opportunity to earn the previously sampled methamphetamine dose on a progressive-ratio procedure. Methamphetamine functioned as a reinforcer, and produced prototypical stimulant-like subject-rated and cardiovascular effects (e.g., increased ratings of Stimulated; elevated blood pressure). Aripiprazole reduced methamphetamine self-administration and attenuated some of the positive subject-rated effects of methamphetamine (e.g., ratings of Like Drug). These results indicate that acute aripiprazole pretreatment attenuates the abuse-related effects of methamphetamine."
"5001","1","Baseline cognitive function predicts full remission of suicidal symptoms among patients with treatment-resistant depression and strong suicidal ideation after low-dose ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Whether pretreatment working memory and response inhibition function are associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine among patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and strong suicidal ideation is unclear. METHODS: We enrolled 65 patients with TRD, comprising 33 who received a single infusion of 0.5 mg/kg ketamine and 32 who received a placebo infusion. The participants performed working memory and go/no-go tasks prior to infusion. We assessed suicidal symptoms at baseline and on postinfusion Days 2, 3, 5, and 7. RESULTS: The full remission of suicidal symptoms persisted for 3 days after a single ketamine infusion and the ketamine-related antisuicidal effect persisted for 1 week. Lower cognitive impairment at baseline (indicated by a higher rate of correct responses on a working memory task) was associated with the rapid and sustained antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine in patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation. DISCUSSION: Patients with TRD and strong suicidal ideation but low cognitive impairment may benefit the most from the antisuicidal effect of low-dose ketamine."
"2995","1","Ascending Single-Dose, Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Safety Study of Noribogaine in Opioid-Dependent Patients.^\nIbogaine is a psychoactive substance that may reduce opioid withdrawal symptoms. This was the first clinical trial of noribogaine, ibogaine's active metabolite, in patients established on methadone opioid substitution therapy (OST). In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled single ascending-dose study, we evaluated the safety, tolerability, and pharmacokinetics of noribogaine in 27 patients seeking to discontinue methadone OST who had been switched to morphine during the previous week. Noribogaine doses were 60, 120, or 180 mg (n = 6/dose level) or matching placebo (n = 3/dose level). Noribogaine was well tolerated. The most frequent treatment-emergent adverse events were noneuphoric changes in light perception ∼1 hour postdose, headache, and nausea. Noribogaine had dose-linear increases for AUC and C(max) and was slowly eliminated (mean t(1/2) range, 24-30 hours). There was a concentration-dependent increase in QTcI (0.17 ms/ng/mL), with the largest observed mean effect of ∼16, 28, and 42 milliseconds in the 60-, 120-, and 180-mg groups, respectively. Noribogaine showed a nonstatistically significant trend toward decreased total score in opioid withdrawal ratings, most notably at the 120-mg dose; however, the study design may have confounded evaluations of time to resumption of OST. Future exposure-controlled multiple-dose noribogaine studies are planned that will address these safety and design issues."

Participants who had taken Ecstasy at the events were significantly more depressed two days later than controls, according to analysis of their BDI-II scores. There was no group difference in impulsivity as measured by the IVE. Levels of self-reported Ecstasy use were not related to depression or impulsivity scores.

Additionally, fresh results from a deluge of clinical neuroimaging studies are unveiling the dynamic effects of serotonergic psychedelics on functional activity within, and connectivity across, discrete neural systems. These observations have led to testable hypotheses regarding neural processing mechanisms that contribute to psychedelic effects and therapeutic benefits. Despite these advances and a plethora of preclinical and clinical observations supporting a central role for brain serotonin 5-HT(2A) receptors in producing serotonergic psychedelic effects, lingering and new questions about mechanisms abound. These chiefly pertain to molecular neuropharmacology. This chapter is devoted to illuminating and discussing such questions in the context of preclinical experimental approaches for studying mechanisms of action of serotonergic psychedelics, classic and new."

However, its pharmacokinetics based on a controlled study is unknown and only partial information on its biotransformation in animal models is available. Our experimental design aimed to study the disposition and kinetic profile of PMMA and its metabolites in rat plasma and selected tissues after the bolus subcutaneous dose of 40 mg/kg, using a GC-MS method. Prior to this, we performed a qualitative verification of its metabolites appearing in excreted urine fractions. PMMA maximum plasma concentration of 4014 +/- 1122 ng/mL was reached 30 min after dosing, whereas the appearance of metabolites was rather delayed. The disposition of PMMA was characterized by its approximate half-life of 1.0 h, volume of distribution of 6.4 L/kg and plasma clearance of 4.4 L/h. PMMA tissue concentration exceeded plasma and the highest one was found in the lungs (c(max) 42,988 +/- 10,223 ng/g). Penetration through the blood/brain barrier was more efficient considering PMMA and its N-desmethylated metabolite PMA (para-methoxyamphetamine) than hydroxylated metabolites. The maximum brain/plasma ratio value of PMMA (15.8) and PMA (11.8) was reached after 8 h of observation. The experimental results ascertained could be useful for subsequent evaluation of the psychotropic or neurotoxic effects of PMMA and for diagnostic concern of intoxication.

"7155","1","Effects of Naturalistic Psychedelic Use on Depression, Anxiety, and Well-Being: Associations With Patterns of Use, Reported Harms, and Transformative Mental States.^\nSurvey-based studies suggest naturalistic psychedelic use provides mental health benefits similar to those observed in clinical trials. The current study sought to confirm these findings in a large group of psychedelic users and to conduct a novel examination of associations between amount of psychedelic use and behavioral outcomes, as well as frequency of harms ascribed to psychedelic use. A cross-sectional, online survey was completed by 2,510 adults reporting at least one lifetime psychedelic experience. Participants retrospectively completed a battery of instruments assessing depression, anxiety, and emotional well-being prior to and following psychedelic exposure. Participants also reported preferred psychedelic agent, number of uses, and harms attributed to psychedelic use. Psychedelic use was associated with significant improvements in depressive and anxious symptoms and with increased emotional well-being. These improvements increased in magnitude with increasing psychedelic exposure, with a ceiling effect. However, improvements were noted following a single lifetime use. Strong evidence for benefit of one preferred psychedelic agent over another was not observed, but enduring increases in factors related to mystical-experience and prosocial perspective taking associated with enhanced mental health. Thirteen percent of the survey sample (n = 330) endorsed at least one harm from psychedelic use, and these participants reported less mental health benefit. Results from the current study add to a growing database indicating that psychedelic use-even outside the context of clinical trials-may provide a wide range of mental health benefits, while also posing some risk for harm in a minority of individuals."

Reduced levels of serotonin may negatively influence social functioning, for example by impairing the recognition of facial emotion expressions. The present study investigated the effect of acute tryptophan depletion (ATD), which reduces brain serotonin, on a related component of social functioning, empathic accuracy (EA), and oxytocin levels. Individuals with (FH+) and without (FH-) a family history of MDD participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover study. On two separate test days, participants ingested tryptophan-deficient and nutritionally balanced amino acid mixtures. Six hours later, they performed an EA task, which involved watching videos of people recounting autobiographical emotional events. While watching, participants continuously rated how these people felt during the recounting. Mood state was repeatedly assessed using the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule and a series of visual analogue scales. Blood samples obtained at baseline and 5 h after mixture ingestion were assessed for tryptophan and oxytocin levels. ATD decreased circulating levels of tryptophan and oxytocin. Nevertheless, there were no significant effects of ATD on EA or mood in either FH group. While previous studies have shown that acute reductions in brain serotonin alter the recognition of facial emotion expressions in never-depressed individuals, the present study suggests that empathic abilities may remain unaffected."

A double-blind, placebo-controlled PET study with [18F]FDG.^\nThe neurometabolic effects of the hallucinogen psilocybin (PSI; 0.2 mg/kg), the entactogen 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDE; 2 mg/kg) and the stimulant d-methamphetamine (METH; 0.2-0.4 mg/kg) and the drugs' interactions with a prefrontal activation task were investigated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled human [F-18]fluorodeoxyglucoseFDG-positron emission tomographicPET study (each group: n = 8). Subjects underwent two scans (control: word repetition; activation word association) within 2-4 weeks. Psilocybin increased rMRGlu in distinct right hemispheric frontotemporal cortical regions, particularly in the anterior cingulate and decreased rMRGlu in the thalamus. Both MDE and METH induced cortical hypometabolism and cerebellar hypermetabolism. In the MDE group, cortical hypometabolism was more pronounced in frontal regions, with the exception of the right anterior cingulate, which tended to be hyperactive. Cognitive activation-related increases in left frontocortical regions were attenuated under all three psychoactive substances, but less so under MDE. Taking into account performance data and subjective reports on task difficulty, these effects may result from different mechanisms across the three groups. Our PSI data are in line with studies on acute schizophrenic patients suggesting frontal overactivity at rest, but diminished capacity to activate prefrontal regions upon cognitive demand. The MDE data support the hypothesis that entactogens constitute a distinct psychoactive substance class, which takes an intermediate position between stimulants and hallucinogens."
"4415","1","Separate and combined effects of low dose ketamine and nicotine on behavioural and neural correlates of sustained attention.^\nGiven the cognitive-promoting properties of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor (nAChR) agonist, nicotine, the increased prevalence of smoke-inhaled nicotine in schizophrenia has been interpreted as an attempt to self-correct cognitive deficits, which have been particularly pronounced in the attentional domain. As glutamatergic abnormalities have been implicated in these attentional deficiencies, this study attempted to shed light on the separate and interactive roles of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) and nAChR systems in the modulation of attention by investigating, in healthy volunteers, the separate and combined effects of nicotine and the NMDAR antagonist ketamine on neural and behavioural responses in a sustained attention task. In a randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled study, performance and the P300 event-related brain potential (ERP) in a visual information processing (RVIP) task were examined in 20 smokers and 20 non-smokers (both male and female). Assessment involved intravenous injection of a low subperceptual bolus dose (.04 mg/kg) of ketamine or placebo, which was accompanied by acute treatment with nicotine (4 mg) or placebo gum. Nicotine-enhanced attentional processing was most evident in nonsmokers, with both performance accuracy and P300 amplitude measures. Ketamine’s detrimental effects on these behavioural and electrophysiologic measures were negatively moderated by acute nicotine, the synergistic effects being expressed differently in smokers and nonsmokers. These findings support the view that acute alterations and individual differences in nAChR function can moderate even subtle glutamatergic-driven cognitive deficiencies in schizophrenia and can be important therapeutic targets for treating cognitive impairments in schizophrenia.

The aim was to determine whether ketamine reproduces the selective impairment of autonoetic awareness observed in schizophrenia, and if it alters encoding or retrieval of information. 26 Ss (19–25 yrs old) were given either a 60-min ketamine or a placebo infusion. Ss carried out episodic memory tasks involving words presented before and during infusion. Memory performance was assessed with recognition and free recall tasks. Subjective states of awareness were assessed using an experiential approach. Levels of psychopathology were evaluated with the brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS). Ketamine impaired performance in free recall and recognition of words presented during, but not before, infusion. There were no differences between groups concerning states of awareness associated with recognition memory. Ss under ketamine had higher BPRS total scores as well as BPRS negative and positive cluster scores than control Ss. Results suggest that ketamine decreases episodic memory performance by impairing encoding, but not retrieval processes. It does not selectively impair subjective states of awareness associated with recognition memory as it has been seen in patients with schizophrenia.

"7269","1","Use of amphetamine by recreational users of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with reduced striatal dopamine transporter densities: A [123I]β-CIT SPECT study - Preliminary report.^\nRationale: Tablets sold as ecstasy often contain not only 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) but other compounds well known to cause dopaminergic neurotoxicity, such as (meth)amphetamine. Furthermore, the use of ecstasy in the Netherlands is often combined with the use of amphetamine. However, little is known about the effects of ecstasy use or the combination of ecstasy and amphetamine use on dopamine (DA) neurones in the human brain. Objectives: This study was designed to investigate the effects of ecstasy as well as the combined use of ecstasy and amphetamine on the density of nigrostriatal DA neurones. Methods: [123I]β-CIT SPECT was used to quantify striatal DA transporters. Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios of control subjects (n=15) were compared with binding ratios of ecstasy users (n=29) and individuals with a history of combined ecstasy and amphetamine use (n=9) after adjustment for age. Results: Striatal [123I]β-CIT binding ratios were significantly lower in combined ecstasy and amphetamine users compared to sole ecstasy users (6.75 versus 8.46, respectively: -20.2%, P=0.007). Binding ratios were significantly higher in ecstasy users when compared to controls (8.46 versus 7.47, respectively: +13.2%, P=0.045). Conclusions: These initial observations suggest that the sole use of ecstasy is not related to dopaminergic neurotoxicity in humans. In contrast, the reported use of amphetamine by regular users of ecstasy seems to be associated with a reduction in nigrostriatal DA neurones."

Methods: The safety, antidepressant, and anti-suicidal effects of multi-infusion ketamine were compared between 19 elderly (≥50 years) and 116 younger (<50 years) adults with depression; all were treated with six ketamine infusions (0.5 mg/kg). Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to measure the depressive symptoms, and suicidal ideation was measured with Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (SSI)-part 1, Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HAMD) item 3, and (MADRS) item 10. Dissociative and psychotomimetic symptoms were evaluated based on the Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) and the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS)-four items. Results: Multi-Ketamine infusions resulted in a lower (trend) antidepressant response (37.1 % versus 57.8 %) and antidepressant remission (15.8 % versus 47.4 %) in elderly patients with depression compared with younger patients with depression (all ps > 0.05). Interestingly, elderly patients with depression had a higher MADRS score after six ketamine infusions compared with younger patients (p = 0.04). No significant differences in SSI-part 1 scores, HAMD item 3 scores, MADRS item 10 scores, CADSS scores, and BPRS-four items scores were found between the two groups at any assessment point (all ps > 0.05). Conclusion: Our study shows that repeated-dose infusions of ketamine may be a feasible treatment strategy in elderly Chinese patients with depression; however, elderly patients with depression may be less responsive to ketamine compared with younger adults with depression."
"6303","1","A Gratuitous Grace: The Influence of Religious Set and Intent on the Psychedelic Experience.^\nPsychedelic drugs, or entheogens, have been used for religious purposes among various cultures for thousands of years. Recently, these substances have caught the attention of Westerners for many reasons, including their propensity to induce mystical experiences. This study examined the relationship between religion and having mystical experiences. A total of 119 participants were drawn from psychedelic-related websites and asked to complete an anonymous online questionnaire containing items regarding history of psychedelic use, set and setting for psychedelic use, and a measure for mystical experiences. A majority of respondents were White males who displayed at least some level of post-secondary education. The findings indicated that respondents who used psychedelics for specifically religious purposes, as well as those who identified with a religion, were more likely to score higher on the Mysticism Scale than those who did not."
"8098","0","Neural mechanisms underlying psilocybin's therapeutic potential - the need for preclinical in vivo electrophysiology.^\nPsilocybin is a naturally occurring psychedelic compound with profound perception-, emotion- and cognition-altering properties and great potential for treating brain disorders. However, the neural mechanisms mediating its effects require in-depth investigation as there is still much to learn about how psychedelic drugs produce their profound and long-lasting effects. In this review, we outline the current understanding of the neurophysiology of psilocybin's psychoactive properties, highlighting the need for additional preclinical studies to determine its effect on neural network dynamics. We first describe how psilocybin's effect on brain regions associated with the default-mode network (DMN), particularly the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus, likely plays a key role in mediating its consciousness-altering properties. We then outline the specific receptor and cell types involved and discuss contradictory evidence from neuroimaging studies regarding psilocybin's net effect on activity within these regions. We go on to argue that in vivo electrophysiology is ideally suited to provide a more holistic, neural network analysis approach to understand psilocybin's mode of action. Thus, we integrate information about the neural bases for oscillatory activity generation with the accumulating evidence about psychedelic drug effects on neural synchrony within DMN-associated areas. This approach will help to generate important questions for future preclinical and clinical studies. Answers to these questions are vital for determining the neural mechanisms mediating psilocybin's psychotherapeutic potential, which promises to improve outcomes for patients with severe depression and other difficulty to treat conditions."
"9224","0","The acute effects of monoamine reuptake inhibitors on the stimulus effects of hallucinogens.^\nIn a previous study it was observed that fluoxetine potentiates the stimulus effects of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). In the present investigation, stimulus control was established in groups of rats using as training drugs the hallucinogens lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD); 0.1 mg/kg), (-)-2,5-dimethoxy-4-methylamphetamine [(-)-DOM; 0.56 mg/kg], ibogaine (10 mg/kg), and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT; 3 mg/kg). A two-lever, fixed-ratio 10, positively reinforced task with saline controls was employed. The hypotheses tested were that (a) monoamine uptake inhibitors other than fluoxetine potentiate the discriminative effects of LSD, and (b) hallucinogens other than LSD are potentiated by acute pretreatment with monoamine uptake inhibitors. The effects of a range of doses of each of the training drugs were determined both alone and following pretreatment with the monoamine reuptake inhibitors fluoxetine, fluvoxamine, and venlafaxine. In LSD-trained subjects, all three reuptake inhibitors caused a significant increase in LSD-appropriate responding. Similar results were observed in rats trained with (-)-DOM and with ibogaine. In 5-MeO-DMT-trained subjects, only fluoxetine resulted in an enhancement of drug-appropriate responding. The reuptake inhibitors given alone elicited varying degrees of responses appropriate for the respective training drugs. For fluoxetine in rats trained with LSD and ibogaine, for venlafaxine in LSD trained, and for fluvoxamine in (-)-DOM trained, the degree of responding met our criterion for intermediate responding, i.e., significantly different from both training conditions. Subsequent experiments in (-)-DOM-trained subjects examined a range of doses of each of the reuptake inhibitors in combination with a fixed dose of ( -)-DOM (0.1 mg/kg), which alone yielded about 50% (-)-DOM-appropriate responding. With the exception of the point obtained with the highest dose of venlafaxine, all data were compatible with additivity of effects rather than true potentiation. In summary, the present data extend our previous observation of the augmentation of the stimulus effects of LSD by fluoxetine to include other hallucinogens. The mechanisms by which these interactions arise and possible differential effects of acute and chronic treatment remain to be established. (C) 1999 Elsevier Science Inc."
"508","0","Profiles of drug users in Switzerland and effects of early-onset intensive use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis on other illicit drug use.^\nQUESTIONS UNDER STUDY / PRINCIPLES: The main aim of this study was to investigate profiles of drug users, with a particular focus on illicit drugs other than cannabis, and to explore the effect of early-onset intensive use (drunkenness, daily smoking, high on cannabis) on profiles of illicit drug use. METHODS: Baseline data from a representative sample of 5,831 young Swiss men in the ongoing Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors were used. Substance use (alcohol, tobacco, cannabis and 15 types of other illicit drug) and age of onset of intensive use were assessed. The Item Response Theory (IRT) and prevalence rates at different ages of onset were used to reveal different profiles of illicit drug use. RESULTS: In addition to cannabis, there were two profiles of other illicit drug use: (a) ""softer"" drug users (uppers, hallucinogens and inhaled drugs), among which ecstasy had the highest discriminatory potential (IRT slope = 4.68, standard error (SE) = 0.48; p <0.001); and (b) ""harder"" drug users (heroin, ketamine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate/gamma- hydroxylactone, research chemicals, crystal meth and spice), among which ketamine had the highest discriminatory potential (slope = 4.05; SE = 0.63; p <0.001). Onset of intensive use at the age of 12 years or younger also discriminated between these two profiles. CONCLUSION: Both the IRT model and the effect of onset of intensive use enabled two groups of illicit drugs to be identified. In particular, very early onset (at 12 years or younger) intensive use of any substance was a marker for later use of the second group of drugs."
"993","0","Ayahuasca and the treatment of drug addiction.^\nThe public health impact of addiction, with its high relapse rates and the limited efficacy of available treatments, has prompted the search for alternative therapeutic approaches. In recent times, there has been renewed interest in the anti-addictive potential of psychedelics. Consumption of ayahuasca, the N,Ndimethyltryptamine- containing Amazonian plant tea, is experiencing unprecedented expansion. The ritual use of this brew, obtained from Banisteriopsis caapi and Psychotria viridis, in shamanistic and religious contexts is now popular in Europe and North America. Studies of long-term ayahuasca-church members in Brazil have recorded discontinuation of drug use after starting ayahuasca use. Furthermore, several centers that offer therapies based on ayahuasca as a means to treat addictive behavior claim higher success rates than more traditional approaches. In this chapter, we review the pharmacology of ayahuasca and the data available concerning its efficacy in the treatment of drug addiction. Although the therapeutic potential of ayahuasca, based on the evidence examined, is promising, the lack of systematic studies precludes firm conclusions. Ideally, research methodology should be improved, with future studies implementing well-planned clinical protocols with adequate controls, end-points, and follow-up. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.

"7767","1","Pilot study of single-dose psilocybin for serotonin reuptake inhibitor-resistant body dysmorphic disorder.^\nOBJECTIVE: Body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is an often-severe condition in which individuals are preoccupied by misperceptions of their appearance as defective or ugly. Only serotonin reuptake inhibitors and cognitive-behavioral therapy have been demonstrated efficacious in randomized controlled trials. Psilocybin is a psychedelic drug with growing evidence for safety and efficacy in treatment of depression. This study aimed to pilot test the feasibility, tolerability, safety, and efficacy of psilocybin treatment of adults with BDD. METHODS: In this open-label trial, 12 adults (8 women, 4 men) with moderate-to-severe non-delusional BDD that had been unresponsive to at least one serotonin reuptake inhibitor trial received a single oral dose of psilocybin 25 mg. There was no control group. Psychological support was provided before, during, and after the dosing session. The primary outcome measure for efficacy was the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Disorder Scale Modified for BDD (BDD-YBOCS) score during 12 weeks of assessments after dosing. RESULTS: All participants completed dosing and all follow-up assessments. BDD-YBOCS scores decreased significantly over 12 weeks of follow-up (p < .001) with a large effect size (partial eta squared = 0.54), and significant changes from baseline were present at week 1 and persisted through week 12. Secondary efficacy measures of BDD symptoms, conviction of belief, negative affect, and disability also improved significantly, and no serious adverse events occurred. At week 12, seven participants (58%) were rated responders, based on ≥30% decrease in BDD-YBOCS. CONCLUSION: This study provides promising preliminary support for psilocybin as a treatment of BDD, warranting future controlled studies."

Subjects (N = 992) were sampled from 23 adolescent drug treatment programs across three modalities (residential, short-term inpatient, outpatient drug-free). Nearly two thirds (64%) of the sample had at least one comorbid mental disorder, most often conduct disorder. Comorbid youth were more likely to be drug or alcohol dependent and had more problems with family, school, and criminal involvement. Although comorbid youth reduced their drug use and other problem behaviors after treatment, they were more likely to use marijuana and hallucinogens, and to engage in illegal acts in the 12 months after treatment, as compared with the noncomorbid adolescents. Integrated treatment protocols need to be implemented within drug treatment programs in order to improve the outcomes of adolescents with comorbid substance use and mental disorders."
"2048","1","Investigating the role of serotonin in visual orientation processing using an 'ecstasy' (MDMA)-based research model.^\nAims/Objectives:A growing body of evidence suggests that regular 'ecstasy' (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) use causes lasting changes to central serotonergic functioning in humans, including in the occipital lobe. Serotonin may play a role in visual orientation processing, mediated in the occipital lobe, via lateral inhibition. The tilt aftereffect is an illusion apparent following adaptation to stimuli angled 5-50° from vertical and thought to be affected by lateral inhibition between occipital neurons. A recent study identified an enhanced tilt aftereffect among ecstasy users, but only in a subset that were recently abstinent from amphetamines. The current study examined the effects of ecstasy use, cannabis use and their interacting effect on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect among participants with no recent history of amphetamine consumption. Materials and Methods: Eleven ecstasy users, 15 cannabis users, 15 ecstasy plus cannabis users and 15 drug-naïve controls were compared on the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect elicited following adaptation to stimuli angled 15, 30, 40 or 60° from vertical. Results:At a 40° adaptation condition, ecstasy users had a greater magnitude of the tilt aftereffect compared to those that had not taken the drug. Additionally, the extent of ecstasy use was positively associated with the magnitude of the tilt aftereffect generated following 15, 30 and 40° adaptation conditions, but not at 60°. Conclusions:Given that lateral inhibition mediates the tilt aftereffect following adaptation to 5-50°, the findings of a relationship between ecstasy use and tilt magnitude at the 15-40° but not 60° adaptation conditions support a role for serotonin in visual orientation processing via lateral inhibition.

Eight patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received fixed low doses of clonidine, 0.025 mg, three times a day for 2 months. They were evaluated by the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI) and a self-report scale on the severity of symptoms (graded 0-5). Patients scored an average of 5.25 (SD = 0.46) on the CGI and 4 on the self-report scale at baseline, indicating marked psychopathology. One patient dropped out at week 3 and a second patient dropped out at week 5. Of the six patients remaining at the end of 2 months, the average CGI score was 2.5 (SD = 0.55) and the self-report scale score was 2, indicating mild symptomatology. LSD-related flashbacks associated with excessive sympathetic nervous activity may be alleviated with clonidine in some patients."
"4557","0","Gamma-hydroxybutyrate: Experience of 9 years of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)-related incidents during rave parties in the Netherlands.^\nObjective. The objective of this study was to determine the health disturbances and to assess the severity of the incidents as reported during a 9-year experience of gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB)-related First Aid Attendees attending First Aid Stations at rave parties. Design. This study was a prospective observational study of self-referred patients from the year 2000 to 2008. During rave parties, First Aid Stations were staffed with specifically trained medical and paramedical personnel. Patients were diagnosed and treated, and data were recorded using standardized methods. Results. During a 9-year period with 202 rave parties, involving approximately three million visitors, 22 604 First Aid Attendees visited the First Aid Stations, of which 771 reported GHB-related health problems. The mean age of the GHB-using First Aid Attendees was 25.7 ± 6.1 years, most of them (66.4%) were male. Approximately one-third (32.7%) of them used one substance, while 48.1% combined GHB with ecstasy, alcohol, or cannabis. One of five (19.2%) combined GHB with other substances or more than one substance. One case was categorized as severe/life-threatening and 202 (26.2%) cases as moderate, requiring further medical care. In total, 43 (5.6%) First Aid Attendees needed hospital care. The most encountered health disturbance was altered consciousness. Combinations of altered consciousness, vomiting, and/or low body temperature were found in 186 cases (24.1%) and considered to be potentially dangerous. GHB-related First Aid Attendees required a longer stay at the First Aid Stations than the total group First Aid Attendees did (median 45 min vs 10 min). Conclusion. We found very little, severe short-term GHB-related health disturbances during rave parties in The Netherlands. Hospital referrals were rare. The most found symptom was altered consciousness, sometimes accompanied by vomiting and low body temperature. At events where the visitors use GHB, a well-trained and qualified medical team, including nurses and physicians, is recommendable. They must be able to recognize GHB intake and prevent secondary problems such as aspiration and hypothermia. © 2011 Informa Healthcare USA, Inc."
"494","0","Effects of intra-articular ketamine on pain and somatosensory function in temporomandibular joint arthralgia patients.^\nRecent studies have hypothesized that peripheral glutamate receptors could be implicated in deep craniofacial pain conditions. In this study 18 temporomandibular joint (TMJ) arthralgia patients received intra-articular injections of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, ketamine, or normal saline to study in a cross-over, double-blinded, placebo-controlled manner the effect on TMJ pain and somatosensory function. Spontaneous pain and pain on jaw function was scored by patients on 0–10 cm visual analogue scale (VAS) for up to 24 h. Quantitative sensory tests (QST): tactile, pin-prick, pressure pain threshold and pressure pain tolerance were used for assessment of somatosensory function at baseline and up to 15 min after injections. There were no significant effects of intra-articular ketamine over time on spontaneous VAS pain measures (ANOVA: P = 0.532), pain on jaw opening (ANOVA: P = 0.384), or any of the somatosensory measures (ANOVA: P > 0.188). The poor effect of ketamine could be due to involvement of non-NMDA receptors in the pain mechanism and/or ongoing pain and central sensitization independent of peripheral nociceptive input. In conclusion, there appears to be no rationale to use intra-articular ketamine injections in TMJ arthralgia patients, and peripheral NMDA receptors may play a minor role in the pathophysiology of this disorder.

"5628","1","An encounter with the self: A thematic and content analysis of the DMT experience from a naturalistic field study.^\nINTRODUCTION: N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is an endogenous serotonergic psychedelic capable of producing radical shifts in an experience that have significant implications for consciousness and its neural correlates, especially given the ""disconnected consciousness"" suggested by the ""breakthrough"" DMT state. Its increasing usage and clinical trial indicate the growing importance of a thorough elucidation of the experience's qualitative content, over and above the phenomenological structure. This is particularly in light of the intensely pervasive effects of DMT occasions in all dimensions of the self, which are often ontologically challenging yet potentially transformative. METHODS: This is the second report on the first naturalistic field study of DMT use exploring its qualitative analysis. Screened, healthy, anonymized, and experienced DMT users were observed during their non-clinical use of the drug at home (40-75-mg inhaled). In-depth semi-structured interviews, inspired by the micro-phenomenological technique, were employed immediately after their experience. This study reports on the thematic and content analysis of one major domain of the breakthrough experiences elicited, the ""self""; where analyses of the ""other"" were previously reported. A total of 36 post-DMT experience interviews with mostly Caucasian (83%) men (eight women) of a mean of 37 years were predominantly inductively coded. RESULTS: Invariably, profound and highly intense experiences occurred. The first overarching category comprised the onset of effects, encompassing super-ordinate themes including sensory, emotion and body, and space-time shifts; the second category comprised bodily effects, encompassing themes including pleasurable, neutral/both, and uncomfortable; the third category comprised the sensorial effects, encompassing open-eye, visual, and cross-modal and other; the fourth comprised the psychological effects, encompassing memory and language, awareness and sense of self, and time distortions; and the fifth comprised the emotional effects, encompassing positive, neither/both, and challenging experiences. Many further subthemes also illuminate the rich content of the DMT experience. DISCUSSION: The present study provides a systematic and nuanced analysis of the content of the breakthrough DMT state pertaining to one's personal and self-referential experiences of the body, senses, psychology, and emotions. The resonances both with previous DMT studies and other types of extraordinary experiences, such as the alien abduction, shamanic and near-death experiences, are also elaborated upon. Putative neural mechanisms and their promise as a psychotherapeutic agent, especially owing to deep emotional impact, are discussed."
"7726","1","Exploratory Controlled Study of the Migraine-Suppressing Effects of Psilocybin.^\nWhile anecdotal evidence suggests that select 5-hydroxytryptamine 2A (5-HT(2A)) receptor ligands, including psilocybin, may have long-lasting therapeutic effects after limited dosing in headache disorders, controlled investigations are lacking. In an exploratory double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, adults with migraine received oral placebo and psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) in 2 test sessions spaced 2 weeks apart. Subjects maintained headache diaries starting 2 weeks before the first session until 2 weeks after the second session. Physiological and psychological drug effects were monitored during sessions and several follow-up contacts with subjects were carried out to assure safety of study procedures. Ten subjects were included in the final analysis. Over the 2-week period measured after single administration, the reduction in weekly migraine days from baseline was significantly greater after psilocybin (mean, - 1.65 (95% CI: - 2.53 to - 0.77) days/week) than after placebo (- 0.15 (- 1.13 to 0.83) days/week; p = 0.003, t(9) = 4.11). Changes in migraine frequency in the 2 weeks after psilocybin were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during drug administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated; there were no unexpected or serious adverse events or withdrawals due to adverse events. This exploratory study suggests there is an enduring therapeutic effect in migraine headache after a single administration of psilocybin. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects is an important finding, urging further investigation into the mechanism underlying the clinical effects of select 5-HT(2A) receptor compounds in migraine, as well as other neuropsychiatric conditions.

In this Viewpoint, we reflect upon the 'Clinical Memorandum on Psychedelics' recently released by the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and note subsequent developments including the application for down-scheduling of psilocybin and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine presently being considered by the Therapeutic Goods Administration and approvals for access via the Special Access Scheme. We suggest that this field is worthy of rigorous research to assess potential benefits, address safety parameters and clarify therapeutic mechanisms. To this end, we outline recent research findings, provide an overview of current knowledge relating to mechanisms of action and discuss salient aspects of the psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy treatment model. The sum of this research points towards medicinal psychedelics as a potential new class of psychiatric treatments when used within a medically supervised framework with integrated psychotherapeutic support. However, before widespread translation into clinical use can occur, appropriately designed and sufficiently powered trials are required to detect both potential positive and negative outcomes. Unique safety and regulatory challenges also need to be addressed. As for any new medical therapy, psychedelic research needs to be conducted in a rigorous manner, through the dispassionate lens of scientific enquiry. Carte blanche availability to practitioners, without specific protocols and appropriate training, would be potentially harmful to individuals and detrimental to the field."
"6236","1","5-HT2A Agonist Psilocybin in the Treatment of Tobacco Use Disorder.^\nThis is a multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized clinical trial of the 5‐HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin for smoking cessation. The investigators previously conducted an open‐label pilot trial (N = 15) of psilocybin paired with cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). Data showed a biologically‐verified 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence rate of 67% at 12 months and 60% at 2.5 years (continuous abstinence rates: 53% and 47%, respectively). The investigators are now conducting an open‐label randomized comparative efficacy trial of psilocybin vs. nicotine patch, both in combination with CBT. Interim results (N = 44; 22 per group) show greater biologically‐verified abstinence rates at 12 months for psilocybin: 7‐day point‐prevalence: 59% vs. 27%; continuous abstinence: 36% vs. 9%. Despite these promising findings, the investigators have yet to conduct a double‐blind study of psilocybin for smoking cessation. Furthermore, previous psilocybin study samples have been largely White with higher socioeconomic status (SES). The current trial will address these issues across three sites with experience in conducting psilocybin research: Johns Hopkins, the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), and New York University (NYU). A diverse sample with regard to ethno‐racial identity and SES will be recruited at each site. The proposed double‐blind study will treat 66 participants (22 at each site), randomized to receive either: 1) psilocybin; 20 mg/70 in session 1 and 30 mg/70 kg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart; or 2) niacin; 250 mg in session 1 and 375 mg in session 2, with sessions 1 week apart. Niacin was selected because it has been used as an active placebo in two previous randomized therapeutic trials of psilocybin, and the FDA has informed the investigators that niacin is the FDA's preferred active placebo for psilocybin. CBT will be administered to both groups and will allow the investigators to test psilocybin's efficacy above and beyond an established treatment approach. Biochemically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence will be assessed throughout for up to 12 months. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin (compared to niacin) will cause increased biologically‐confirmed 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐month follow‐up. Based on pilot data, the investigators will test cognitive/psychological mediators of treatment response. The investigators hypothesize that psilocybin will be associated with improved cognitive control and decreased anticipation of withdrawal relief (from smoking) 1 day after the target quit date, which will be associated with greater 7‐day point‐prevalence abstinence at 12‐ month follow‐up. This trial will provide a rigorous test of efficacy in a diverse study sample, and test relevant mechanisms, for an innovative smoking cessation treatment showing potential for substantial efficacy."
"5570","1","Lack of effect of sublingual salvinorin A, a naturally occurring kappa opioid, in humans: a placebo-controlled trial.^\nRATIONALE: Salvinorin A (SA) is a highly selective kappa opioid receptor agonist and the putative psychoactive compound in Salvia divinorum (SD), an increasingly abused hallucinogenic plant. OBJECTIVES: The objectives of this study were to characterize the physiological and subjective effects of SA versus placebo and measure drug and metabolite levels. METHODS: Sublingual SA doses up to 4 mg were administered in dimethyl sulfoxide/polyethylene glycol 400 solution to eight SD-experienced subjects using a placebo-controlled ascending-dose design. RESULTS: No dose of SA produced significantly greater physiological or subjective effects than placebo. Furthermore, effects did not resemble reported ""typical"" effects of smoked SD. SA was detectable in plasma and urine, but was, in most cases, below the reliable limit of quantification (0.5 ng/mL). CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that the sublingual bioavailability of SA is low. Higher doses, alternate formulations, or alternate routes of administration will be necessary to study the effects of SA in humans."
"9593","1","Plasma inflammatory cytokines and treatment-resistant depression with comorbid pain: improvement by ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: Treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and pain frequently coexist clinically. Ketamine has analgesic and antidepressant effects, but few studies have evaluated individual differences in antidepressant outcomes to repeated ketamine in TRD patients with comorbid pain. Our aims were to determine the difference in ketamine's antidepressant effects in TRD patients with or without pain and then to examine whether inflammatory cytokines might contribute to ketamine's effect. METHODS: Sixty-six patients with TRD received six infusions of ketamine. Plasma levels of 19 inflammatory cytokines were assessed at baseline and post-infusion (day 13 and day 26) using the Luminex assay. Plasma inflammatory cytokines of sixty healthy controls (HCs) were also examined. RESULTS: TRD patients with pain had a higher antidepressant response rate (χ(2) = 4.062, P = 0.044) and remission rate (χ(2) = 4.062, P = 0.044) than patients without pain. Before ketamine treatment, GM-CSF and IL-6 levels were higher in the pain group than in the non-pain and HC groups. In the pain group, levels of TNF-α and IL-6 at day 13 and GM-CSF, fractalkine, IFN-γ, IL-10, MIP-3α, IL-12P70, IL-17α, IL-1β, IL-2, IL-4, IL-23, IL-5, IL-6, IL-7, MIP-1β, and TNF-α at day 26 were lower than those at baseline; in the non-pain group, TNF-α levels at day 13 and day 26 were lower than those at baseline. In the pain group, the changes of IL-6 were associated with improvement in pain intensity (β = 0.333, P = 0.001) and depressive symptoms (β = 0.478, P = 0.005) at day 13. Path analysis showed the direct (β = 2.995, P = 0.028) and indirect (β = 0.867, P = 0.042) effects of changes of IL-6 on improvement in depressive symptoms both were statistically significant. CONCLUSION: This study suggested that an elevated inflammatory response plays a critical role in individual differences in TRD patients with or without pain. Ketamine showed great antidepressant and analgesic effects in TRD patients with pain, which may be related to its effects on modulating inflammation. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ChiCTR , ChiCTR-OOC-17012239.

"3216","1","Ketamine for Rapid Reduction of Suicidal Thoughts in Major Depression: A Midazolam-Controlled Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Pharmacotherapy to rapidly relieve suicidal ideation in depression may reduce suicide risk. Rapid reduction in suicidal thoughts after ketamine treatment has mostly been studied in patients with low levels of suicidal ideation. The authors tested the acute effect of adjunctive subanesthetic intravenous ketamine on clinically significant suicidal ideation in patients with major depressive disorder. METHOD: In a randomized clinical trial, adults (N=80) with current major depressive disorder and a score ≥4 on the Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), of whom 54% (N=43) were taking antidepressant medication, were randomly assigned to receive ketamine or midazolam infusion. The primary outcome measure was SSI score 24 hours after infusion (at day 1). RESULTS: The reduction in SSI score at day 1 was 4.96 points greater for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (95% CI=2.33, 7.59; Cohen's d=0.75). The proportion of responders (defined as having a reduction ≥50% in SSI score) at day 1 was 55% for the ketamine group and 30% for the midazolam group (odds ratio=2.85, 95% CI=1.14, 7.15; number needed to treat=4.0). Improvement in the Profile of Mood States depression subscale was greater at day 1 for the ketamine group compared with the midazolam group (estimate=7.65, 95% CI=1.36, 13.94), and this effect mediated 33.6% of ketamine's effect on SSI score. Side effects were short-lived, and clinical improvement was maintained for up to 6 weeks with additional optimized standard pharmacotherapy in an uncontrolled follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Adjunctive ketamine demonstrated a greater reduction in clinically significant suicidal ideation in depressed patients within 24 hours compared with midazolam, partially independently of antidepressant effect."
"3767","1","Self-medication with psychedelic microdoses amongst microdosers with disorders.^\nBackground: A substantial number of people worldwide suffer from mental health problems during their lifetime. Although standard therapy and prescriptions are often effective, it is known that treatment is not a ""one‐size‐fits‐all"" cure; many patients experience unbearable side effects, and some never reach remission. In light of this, there has been renewed interest in the therapeutic potential of psychedelic drugs, with preliminary clinical trials using 'regular' full psychedelic doses demonstrating promising results. Over the last couple of years, the use of low 'micro' doses of psychedelics for health‐related purposes has received increased visibility and interest to reduce symptoms of anxiety, depression or pain. Anecdotal evidence suggests that next to regular psychedelic doses, low doses are also effective, and may be more suitable for certain conditions. Nonetheless, empirical evidence regarding the efficacy of microdosing for symptomatic relief is lacking and no scientific effort is made to inquire on a larger scale for which conditions people use psychedelic microdoses and whether they deem this to be more effective than standard treatments (ST) or 'regular' high psychedelic doses (HPD). The present study therefore investigated the self‐rated effectiveness (SRE) of microdosing with psychedelics (MDP), compared to ST and HDP. Methods: An online questionnaire was launched on several websites and fora for four months. In total 63% (N = 3'590) of the people who initially clicked the link consented and were 18 years of age or older and completed the survey. Of them, 7.2% (N = 410) had experience with microdosing and was diagnosed by a medical doctor or therapist with at least one mental or physical disorder. This group was included in the analyses. Respondents were asked which psychedelics they used to selfmedicate with, for which condition and whether they experienced it as effective. The latter was assessed with three questions: 'Do you feel the treatment worked' (Q1), 'did the symptoms disappear' (Q2), and 'did your quality of life improve' (Q3). Binary logistic regression (odds ratio, OR) was conducted to compare the SRE with psychedelic microdoses with ST, and HDP, for the mental and physical disorder diagnoses for each of the three effectiveness questions. When cell count was less than 10 events per independent variable, no regression was conducted. For each OR, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are given and statistical significance was set at p = 0.05. An OR of 1.5 is defined as small, two as medium, and three as large. Results: Odds ratio showed that SRE of MDP was statistically higher (p < 0.01) compared to that of ST for both mental (OR(Q1) = 2.3; OR(Q2) = 2.48; OR(Q3) = 2.77) and physical (OR(Q1) = 6.14; OR(Q2) = 7.74; OR(Q3) = 4.36) diagnoses. These effects were specific for neurodevelopmental and anxiety disorders. In contrast, SRE of MDP was lower compared to that of higher psychedelic doses for mental disorders such as anxiety and depression (OR (Q1) = 0.15; OR(Q2) = 0.31; OR(Q3) = 0.13; p(OR Q1,2,3) < 0.01), while for physical disorders no difference was shown (OR(Q1) = 0.45, p = 0.27; OR(Q2) = 0.79, p = 0.79; OR(Q3) = 0.25, p = 0.09). Conclusions: This study demonstrates that SRE of MDP to alleviate symptoms of a range of mental or physical diagnoses is higher compared to ST and lower than HDP. Findings provide a rationale to assess indications of the therapeutic potential of psychedelics using randomized clinical trials in patient populations, and support assessment of effectivity claims of psychedelics, and whether these are dose‐related, disorder‐specific and superior to ST."
"5472","0","The ""Next Day"" Effects of Cannabis Use: A Systematic Review.^\nBackground: Δ(9)-Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), the main intoxicating component of cannabis, can cause cognitive and psychomotor impairment. Whether this impairment is still present many hours or even days after THC use requires clarification. Possible ""next day"" effects are of major significance in safety-sensitive workplaces. We therefore conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the ""next day"" effects of THC. Methods: Studies that measured performance on safety-sensitive tasks (e.g., driving, flying) and/or neuropsychological tests >8 h after THC (or cannabis) use using interventional designs were identified by searching two online databases from inception until March 28, 2022. Risk of bias (RoB) was evaluated using the relevant Cochrane tools. Results were described in terms of whether THC had a significant effect on performance relative to the primary comparator (i.e., placebo or baseline, as appropriate). Results: Twenty studies (n=458) involving 345 performance tests were reviewed. Most studies administered a single dose of THC (median [interquartile range]: 16 [11-26] mg) and assessed performance between >12 and 24 h post-treatment. N=209/345 tests conducted across 16 published studies showed no ""next day"" effects of THC. Nine of these 16 studies used randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs. Half (N=8) had ""some"" RoB, and half (N=8) had a ""high"" RoB. Notably, N=88 of these 209 tests failed to demonstrate ""acute"" (i.e., <8 h post-treatment) THC-induced impairment. N=12/345 tests conducted across five published studies indicated negative (i.e., impairing) ""next day"" effects of THC. None of these five studies used randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled designs and all were published >18 years ago (four, >30 years ago). Three had ""some"" RoB, and two had a ""high"" RoB. A further N=121/345 tests indicated ""unclear"" ""next day"" effects of THC with insufficient information provided to assess outcomes. The remaining N=3/345 tests indicated positive (i.e., enhancing) ""next day"" effects of THC. Conclusions: Some lower quality studies have reported ""next day"" effects of THC on cognitive function and safety-sensitive tasks. However, most studies, including some of higher quality, have found no such effect. Overall, it appears that there is limited scientific evidence to support the assertion that cannabis use impairs ""next day"" performance. Further studies involving improved methodologies are required to better address this issue."
"452","0","Developments in the field of antidepressants, where do we go now?.^\nMajor depression is a severe psychiatric syndrome with very high prevalence and socio-economic impact. Its pathophysiology is poorly known, yet several neurotransmitter systems and brain areas have been implicated. Selective serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) reuptake inhibitors (SSRI) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI) are most used antidepressant treatments. However, these drugs show slow onset of action and limited efficacy, making necessary the use of drug augmentation strategies or more aggressive interventions. Two important observations have emerged in recent years indicating that more rapid and effective antidepressant treatments are possible. Hence, the deep brain stimulation (DBS) of ventral anterior (subgenual) cingulate cortex (Cg25) evokes rapid mood improvements in subgroups of treatment-resistant depressive patients, likely mediated by a functional remodelling of cortico-limbic circuits. On the other hand, the noncompetitive NDMA receptor antagonist ketamine can also evoke rapid (e.g., 2 h) and persistent (up to 1 wk) improvements in some treatment-resistant patients. Moreover, recent preclinical observations indicate the antidepressant capacity of mGluR agents. Overall, this supports the usefulness of glutamatergic transmission as a new area in antidepressant drug development. On the monoamine side, new preclinical and clinical research should clarify the different roles played by 5-HT receptors in depression as well as the brain areas and circuits responsible for therapeutic improvement. This will lead to the synthesis of new agents blocking the serotonin (and possibly norepinephrine) transporter which will also activate or block 5-HT receptors playing respectively positive (e.g., postsynaptic 5-HT1A, 5-HT4) or negative (e.g., presynaptic 5-HT1A,/(1B), 5-HT2A, 5-HT2C,5-HT3, etc.) roles in antidepressant effects.

"4156","0","Ketamine and nitrous oxide: The evolution of NMDA receptor antagonists as antidepressant agents.^\nN-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonists, including ketamine and nitrous oxide, are currently intensely studied as rapid-acting antidepressant agents. Interestingly, both of these compounds are also drugs of abuse. Intravenous ketamine, a dissociative anesthetic that induces complex downstream effects via NMDARs, rapidly reduces depressive and suicidal symptoms in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), as demonstrated by several trials. Recently, the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved an intranasal version of ketamine (esketamine) for TRD. The United States Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) lists ketamine as a Class III scheduled drug (moderate-low potential for physical and psychological abuse). The FDA has established a Risk Evaluation and Management Strategy (REMS) program to ensure proper drug storage, handling, dispensing, and monitoring intranasal esketamine to minimize misuse/abuse opportunities. Nitrous Oxide is a colorless, odorless, gas that has been in medical use for over 150 years. The mechanisms of action of nitrous oxide are not fully understood; however, it is known to act as a non-competitive inhibitor of NMDA-type glutamate receptors. Currently, nitrous oxide is used for inhalational general anesthesia and analgesia for short procedures. Inhaled nitrous oxide is also used recreationally, primarily by teens and young adults, but is not believed to have strong addiction potential. In contrast to ketamine, nitrous oxide is not a controlled substance and can be legally purchased without a prescription. A recent double-blind, prospective, cross-over study demonstrated that nitrous oxide reduced depressive symptoms in a group of severely ill TRD patients. Though this is a promising initial study, further investigation is needed. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2021 APA, all rights reserved)"

"1462","1","Working memory associated with anti-suicidal ideation effect of repeated-dose intravenous ketamine in depressed patients.^\nSuicide is a tremendous threat to global public health, and a large number of people who committed suicide suffered the pain of mental diseases, especially major depressive disorder (MDD). Previous study showed that ketamine could reduce suicidal ideation (SI), potentially by improving the impaired working memory (WM). The objective of current study was to illuminate the relationship between WM and SI in MDD with repeated ketamine treatment. MDD patients with SI (n = 59) and without SI (n = 37) completed six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Day 1, 3, 5, 8, 10 and 12). The severity of depressive symptoms, SI and WM were assessed at baseline, day 13 and day 26. We found that WM was significantly improved after 6 ketamine infusions (F = 161.284, p = 0.009) in a linear mixed model. Correlation analysis showed that the improvement of depressive symptom was significantly associated with WM at baseline (r =  - 0.265, p = 0.042) and the reduction in SSI-part I was related to the change of WM (r = 0.276, p = 0.034) in the MDD patients with SI. Furthermore, Logistic regression analysis showed that improvement in WM might predict the anti-SI response of ketamine. Our findings suggest that the improvement of working memory may partly account for the anti-SI effect of ketamine, and intervention of improving working memory function may be capable of reducing suicidal ideation."
"2019","0","The promise of ketamine for treatment-resistant depression: current evidence and future directions.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most disabling diseases worldwide and is becoming a significant public health threat. Current treatments for MDD primarily consist of monoamine-targeting agents and have limited efficacy. However, the glutamate neurotransmitter system has recently come into focus as a promising alternative for novel antidepressant treatments. We review the current data on the glutamate NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine, which has been shown in clinical trials to act as a rapid antidepressant in MDD. We also examine ketamine efficacy on dimensions of psychopathology, including anhedonia, cognition, and suicidality, consistent with the NIMH Research Domain Criteria initiative. Other aspects of ketamine reviewed in this paper include safety and efficacy, different administration methods, and the risks of misuse of ketamine outside of medical settings. Finally, we conclude with a discussion of glutamatergic agents other than ketamine currently being tested as novel antidepressants."

It was concluded that in cognitive or motor function tests, there was no change in rank order performance of the individuals in the post drug period as compared to their pre drug period, which served as a control. Psychological testing failed to reveal any evidence of personality derangement or evidence of toxicity from the drug. Psychological evaluation failed to reveal trauma to the psyche from the drug or from the design of the experiment. Electroencephalographic interpretation revealed an interesting and unusual feature of the drug, for all records remained essentially normal but changed from the awake pattern to a 'drowsy' or light sleep record without other evidence of drug imposition. Subject acceptance of the drug, in spite of almost universal reporting by the volunteers of unusual dreams or experiences, did not produce problems of serious magnitude in this study. This drug has been advanced to phase III clinical trials at six university medical centers and these results will be followed closely."
"996","1","Psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine: Dose versus effect relationships.^\nPsychotomimetic emergence phenomena following general anesthesia with ketamine are well documented, and affect 5-30% of patients. The psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been less well studied. We administered ketamine or saline in single blinded, crossover fashion to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using a computer-assisted continuous ketamine infusion that achieved a stepwise series of 5 constant plasma levels of ketamine, at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 jug/ml. After approximately 20 min at each level, to allow for equilibration with the biophase, the volunteer completed a visual analog rating of 13 psychotic and dissociative symptom scales involving color, reality, sounds, body parts, ideas of reference, surroundings, time, euphoria, out-of-control thoughts, anxiety, drowsiness and suspiciousness. Target ketamine levels were verified by measuring actual plasma concentration. Ketamine produced marked psychotomimetic effects that were doserelated in a highly linear fashion for all scales (r 0.92; p 0.03). Effects on anxiety, suspiciousness, and ideas of reference were weakest, attaining less than 22% of the maximum possible effect. For all other scales, 37-89% of the maximum possible effect was attained."
"2251","0","Stress, mental disorder and ketamine as a novel, rapid acting treatment.^\nThe experience of stress is often utilised in models of emerging mental illness and neurobiolog-ical systems are implicated as the intermediary link between the experience of psychological stress and the development of a mental disorder. Chronic stress and prolonged glucocorticoid exposure have potent effects on neuronal architecture particularly in regions that modulate the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and are commonly associated with psychiatric disorders. This review provides an overview of stress modulating neurobiological and neuro-chemical systems which underpin stress-related structural and functional brain changes. These changes are thought to contribute not only to the development of disorders, but also to the treatment resistance and chronicity seen in some of our most challenging mental disorders. Reports to date suggest that stress-related psychopathology is the aetiological mechanism of these disorders and thus we review the rapid acting antidepressant ketamine as an effective emerging treatment. Ketamine, an N-methyl D -aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is shown to induce a robust treatment effect in mental disorders via enhanced synaptic strength and connectivity in key brain regions. Whilst ketamine's glutamatergic effect has been previously examined, we further consider ketamine's capacity to modulate the HPA axis and associated pathways.(c) 2022 Elsevier B.V. and ECNP.

"1770","1","Glycine transporter inhibitor attenuates the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in healthy males: preliminary evidence.^\nEnhancing glutamate function by stimulating the glycine site of the NMDA receptor with glycine, D-serine, or with drugs that inhibit glycine reuptake may have therapeutic potential in schizophrenia. The effects of a single oral dose of cis-N-methyl-N-(6-methoxy-1-phenyl-1,2,3,4-tetrahydronaphthalen-2-ylmethyl) amino-methylcarboxylic acid hydrochloride (Org 25935), a glycine transporter-1 (GlyT1) inhibitor, and placebo pretreatment on ketamine-induced schizophrenia-like psychotic symptoms, perceptual alterations, and subjective effects were evaluated in 12 healthy male subjects in a randomized, counter-balanced, within-subjects, crossover design. At 2.5 h after administration of the Org 25935 or placebo, subjects received a ketamine bolus and constant infusion lasting 100 min. Psychotic symptoms, perceptual, and a number of subjective effects were assessed repeatedly before, several times during, and after completion of ketamine administration. A cognitive battery was administered once per test day. Ketamine produced behavioral, subjective, and cognitive effects consistent with its known effects. Org 25935 reduced the ketamine-induced increases in measures of psychosis (Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS)) and perceptual alterations (Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale (CADSS)). The magnitude of the effect of Org 25935 on ketamine-induced increases in Total PANSS and CADSS Clinician-rated scores was 0.71 and 0.98 (SD units), respectively. None of the behavioral effects of ketamine were increased by Org 25935 pretreatment. Org 25935 worsened some aspects of learning and delayed recall, and trended to improve choice reaction time. This study demonstrates for the first time in humans that a GlyT1 inhibitor reduces the effects induced by NMDA receptor antagonism. These findings provide preliminary support for further study of the antipsychotic potential of GlyT1 inhibitors."
"3791","1","Course of improvement in depressive symptoms to a single intravenous infusion of ketamine vs add-on riluzole: results from a 4-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled study.^\nThe N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine has rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant major depression (TRD); these effects have been reported to last for 1 week in some patients. However, the extent and duration of this antidepressant effect over longer periods has not been well characterized under controlled conditions. Riluzole, a glutamatergic modulator with antidepressant and synaptic plasticity-enhancing effects, could conceivably be used to promote the antidepressant effects of ketamine. This study sought to determine the extent and time course of antidepressant improvement to a single-ketamine infusion over 4 weeks, comparing the addition of riluzole vs placebo after the infusion. Forty-two subjects (18-65) with TRD and a Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score of ≥ 22 received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). Four to six hours post-infusion, subjects were randomized to double-blind treatment with either riluzole (100-200 mg/day; n=21) or placebo (n=21) for 4 weeks. Depressive symptoms were rated daily. A significant improvement (P<0.001) in MADRS scores from baseline was found. The effect size of improvement with ketamine was initially large and remained moderate throughout the 28-day trial. Overall, 27% of ketamine responders had not relapsed by 4 weeks following a single ketamine infusion. The average time to relapse was 13.2 days (SE=2.2). However, the difference between the riluzole and placebo treatment groups was not significant, suggesting that the combination of riluzole with ketamine treatment did not significantly alter the course of antidepressant response to ketamine alone."
"3813","0","Psychedelics in Psychiatry: Neuroplastic, Immunomodulatory, and Neurotransmitter Mechanisms.^\nMounting evidence suggests safety and efficacy of psychedelic compounds as potential novel therapeutics in psychiatry. Ketamine has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration in a new class of antidepressants, and 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is undergoing phase III clinical trials for post-traumatic stress disorder. Psilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) are being investigated in several phase II and phase I clinical trials. Hence, the concept of psychedelics as therapeutics may be incorporated into modern society. Here, we discuss the main known neurobiological therapeutic mechanisms of psychedelics, which are thought to be mediated by the effects of these compounds on the serotonergic (via 5-HT(2A) and 5-HT(1A) receptors) and glutamatergic [via N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) and α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors] systems. We focus on 1) neuroplasticity mediated by the modulation of mammalian target of rapamycin-, brain-derived neurotrophic factor-, and early growth response-related pathways; 2) immunomodulation via effects on the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, nuclear factor ĸB, and cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor-α and interleukin 1, 6, and 10 production and release; and 3) modulation of serotonergic, dopaminergic, glutamatergic, GABAergic, and norepinephrinergic receptors, transporters, and turnover systems. We discuss arising concerns and ways to assess potential neurobiological changes, dependence, and immunosuppression. Although larger cohorts are required to corroborate preliminary findings, the results obtained so far are promising and represent a critical opportunity for improvement of pharmacotherapies in psychiatry, an area that has seen limited therapeutic advancement in the last 20 years. Studies are underway that are trying to decouple the psychedelic effects from the therapeutic effects of these compounds. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: Psychedelic compounds are emerging as potential novel therapeutics in psychiatry. However, understanding of molecular mechanisms mediating improvement remains limited. This paper reviews the available evidence concerning the effects of psychedelic compounds on pathways that modulate neuroplasticity, immunity, and neurotransmitter systems. This work aims to be a reference for psychiatrists who may soon be faced with the possibility of prescribing psychedelic compounds as medications, helping them assess which compound(s) and regimen could be most useful for decreasing specific psychiatric symptoms."
"1301","0","The schizophrenia ketamine challenge study debate.^\nProtection of subjects in psychiatric research is an issue of considerable public and professional interest. Perhaps the most hotly debated issue concerns challenge study protocols where symptoms of illness are increased in a bioassay designed to gain knowledge of pathophysiology. Although widely used in biomedical research, the ethics of this application in mental illness research are contested. At issue is whether acute distress and lasting harm are caused without direct benefit in vulnerable subjects without valid informed consent. The ketamine challenge study in schizophrenia subjects is at the vortex of the current debate. This report presents background data on ketamine safety and a qualitative and quantitative analysis of data from all schizophrenia subjects in North American ketamine studies. Duration and severity of change in psychosis and anxiety, ""worst case"" experiences, and information on prolonged adverse effects are detailed. The vulnerable population and informed consent issue is discussed. Group results show that psychosis increase is mild to moderate and brief, anxiety is mild and brief, and no evidence of prolonged adverse effects is found. Few ""worst case"" incidents were identified, and these were clinically managed successfully in a short time period. Although more difficult to evaluate, informed consent procedures seem adequate, and consent was voluntary in subjects judged to have decisional capacity for this purpose and in circumstances where alternative clinical care could be freely chosen. The author concludes that ketamine challenge studies meet ethical standards, have been conducted without lasting adverse effects, that discomfort is modest and brief, and important new knowledge has been gained of potential benefit to the class from which subjects were drawn."
"1457","0","Molecular mechanisms of rapid-acting antidepressants: New perspectives for developing antidepressants.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is a chronic relapsing psychiatric disorder. Conventional antidepressants usually require several weeks of continuous administration to exert clinically significant therapeutic effects, while about two-thirds of the patients are prone to relapse of symptoms or are completely ineffective in antidepressant treatment. The recent success of the N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine as a rapid-acting antidepressant has propelled extensive research on the action mechanism of antidepressants, especially in relation to its role in synaptic targets. Studies have revealed that the mechanism of antidepressant action of ketamine is not limited to antagonism of postsynaptic NMDA receptors or GABA interneurons. Ketamine produces powerful and rapid antidepressant effects by affecting α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazole-propionic acid receptors, adenosine A1 receptors, and the L-type calcium channels, among others in the synapse. More interestingly, the 5-HT2A receptor agonist psilocybin has demonstrated potential for rapid antidepressant effects in depressed mouse models and clinical studies. This article focuses on a review of new pharmacological target studies of emerging rapid-acting antidepressant drugs such as ketamine and hallucinogens (e.g., psilocybin) and briefly discusses the possible strategies for new targets of antidepressants, with a view to shed light on the direction of future antidepressant research."
"7293","1","The perceptions of cancer health-care practitioners in New Zealand and the USA toward psychedelic-assisted therapy with cancer patients: A cross-sectional survey.^\nOBJECTIVES: A resurgence of research investigating the administration of psychedelic compounds alongside psychotherapy suggests that this treatment is a promising intervention for anxiety, depression, and existential distress in people with cancer. However, psychedelic treatment that induces a mind-altering experience potentially poses barriers to vulnerable cancer patients, and health-care practitioners may have concerns about referring their patients to trials investigating this approach. The aim of the current study was to investigate the perceptions of cancer health-care practitioners based in New Zealand and the USA related to psychedelic-assisted therapy. METHODS: This study utilized a cross-sectional survey of cancer health-care practitioners in New Zealand and the USA via convenience sampling to identify their perceptions about the concept of conducting psychedelic-assisted therapy with cancer patients. RESULTS: Participants perceived that (1) psychedelic-assisted therapy has the potential to provide benefit for cancer patients, (2) research in this area across a variety of domains is important, (3) work should consider spiritual and indigenous perspectives of health, and (4) there was willingness to refer patients to trials in this area, especially patients with advanced disease who were no longer going through curative treatment. Participants in the USA had greater awareness of psychedelics than the New Zealand sample; however, New Zealand participants more strongly believed that spiritual/indigenous factors should be considered in psychedelic-assisted therapy. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: Cancer health-care practitioners in our sample considered research investigating the potential for psychedelic-assisted therapies to be important and may be more open to studies that start in palliative and end-of-life contexts."
"4927","0","Psychoactive substances and violent offences: A retrospective analysis of presentations to an urban emergency department in Switzerland.^\nBackground Psychoactive substances are often regarded as causal factors contributing to violent injuries, sexual abuse and homicides. While these effects have been demonstrated for some substances (e.g. cocaine), current available data for others are more controversial (e.g. cannabis) or very limited (e.g. ecstasy). Aims of the study To collect data on the type and frequency of psychoactive substance use in cases of emergency department (ED) presentations related to interpersonal violence. Methods Retrospective study at the University Hospital of Bern, Switzerland, between May 2012 and June 2016. The study covered cases of violent crime associated with psychoactive substances. Cases of isolated ethanol intoxication, suicide attempts, and substance use for medical purposes were excluded. Results The study included 103 cases among the 164,846 ED attendances. In the majority of the cases, the type of violence was bodily force (52%) related to urban violence (83%). The mean patient age was 29 years and 79% were male. 63% of the patients reported use of more than one drug; alcohol co-use was reported in 60% of the cases. Besides alcohol, the substances most often reported were cannabis (50%) and cocaine (21%). Alcohol and cannabis was also the most commonly reported substance combination (36% of the total cases). Urine drug screening was performed in 34% of the cases and cannabis and cocaine were the most commonly detected substances (46% and 19%, respectively). There were no cases of novel substances. 23% of the patients were admitted to a hospital ward, 10% to a psychiatric clinic. Conclusion Cannabis and cocaine were, besides alcohol, the substances most often reported in ED presentations related to offences of violence. Because of the high prevalence of alcohol co-use, no final conclusions can be drawn on the contribution of single substances."

Psychological and existential suffering is common in cancer patients, associated with poor psychiatric and medical outcomes. Promising early-phase clinical research (1960s to early 1970s) suggested a therapeutic signal for serotoninergic psychedelics (e.g. psilocybin, LSD) in treating cancer-related psychiatric distress. After several decades of quiescence, research on psychedelic-assisted therapy to treat psychiatric disorders in cancer patients has resumed within the last 2 decades in the US and Europe. This review article is based on a systematic search of clinical trials from 1960-2018 researching the therapeutic use of psychedelic treatment in patients with serious or terminal illnesses and related psychiatric illness. The search found 10 eligible clinical trials, with a total of 445 participants, with the vast majority of the patients having advanced or terminal cancer diagnoses. Six open label trials, published between 1964 and 1980 (n = 341), suggested that psychedelic therapy (mostly with LSD) may improve cancer-related depression, anxiety, and fear of death. Four RCTs trials were published between 2011 and 2016 (n = 104), mostly with psilocybin treatment (n = 92), and demonstrated that psychedelic-assisted treatment can produce rapid, robust, and sustained improvements in cancer-related psychological and existential distress."
"7148","0","The minor cannabinoid cannabigerol (CBG) is a highly specific blood biomarker of recent cannabis smoking.^\nINTRODUCTION: The determination of recent cannabis use is of forensic interest in the investigation of automotive crashes, workplace incidents and other mishaps. Because Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol may persist in blood after psychoactive effects of intoxication resolve, particularly in regular users, short-lived minor cannabinoids such as cannabigerol have merited examination as adjunct indicators of recent cannabis inhalation. METHODS: As part of an observational cohort study, whole blood cannabinoids including cannabigerol were measured in whole blood by liquid chromatography with tandem mass spectrometry at baseline, and 30 minutes after initiation of a 15-minute supervised interval of ad libitum cannabis smoking in occasional (1-2 days/week over the past 30 days) (n = 24) and daily cannabis smokers (n = 32). Per protocol, subjects self-reported abstention from inhaling cannabis (>8 h) or ingesting cannabis (>12 h) prior to baseline measurement. RESULTS: At baseline, none of the occasional users had detectable cannabigerol (limit of detection = 0.2 µg/L), whereas cannabigerol was detectable post-smoking in 7 of 24 (29%). Among daily cannabis users, 2 of 32 (6%) had detectable cannabigerol at baseline, increasing to 21 of 32 (66%) post-smoking. The odds ratio for recent cannabis smoking associated with a detectable cannabigerol was 27 (95% confidence interval: 6.6, 110.3). In this mixed cohort of occasional and daily cannabis users, receiver operator characteristic curve analysis indicated that whole blood cannabigerol concentration of ≥ 0.2 µg/L had 96% specificity, 50% sensitivity, and 73% accuracy for identifying a 15-minute interval of ad libitum cannabis smoking initiated 30 minutes earlier. Post smoking blood Δ9-tetrahydrocannabinol (median = 5.6 µg/L in occasional users, 21.3 µg/L in daily users) was significantly correlated with post-smoking cannabigerol (P < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: Whole blood cannabigerol may have forensic utility as a highly specific albeit insensitive biomarker of recent cannabis smoking."
"7356","1","Impaired perception of self-motion (heading) in abstinent ecstasy and marijuana users.^\nRATIONALE: Illicit drug use can increase driver crash risk due to loss of control over vehicle trajectory. This study asks, does recreational use of +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC; marijuana) impair cognitive processes that help direct our safe movement through the world? OBJECTIVE: This study assesses the residual effects of combined MDMA/THC use, and of THC use alone, upon perceived trajectory of travel. METHODS: Perception of self-motion, or heading, from optical flow patterns was assessed using stimuli comprising random dot ground planes presented at three different densities and eight heading angles (1, 2, 4 and 8 degrees to the left or right). On each trial, subjects reported if direction of travel was to the left or the right. RESULTS: Results showed impairments in both drug groups, with the MDMA/THC group performing the worst. CONCLUSIONS: The finding that these psychoactive agents adversely affect heading perception, even in recently abstinent users, raises potential concerns about MDMA use and driving ability."

The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references)."
"7460","1","Microdosing psychedelics: Demographics, practices, and psychiatric comorbidities.^\nRATIONALE: Microdosing psychedelics - the practice of consuming small, sub-hallucinogenic doses of substances such as LSD or psilocybin - is gaining attention in popular media but remains poorly characterized. Contemporary studies of psychedelic microdosing have yet to report the basic psychiatric descriptors of psychedelic microdosers. OBJECTIVES: To examine the practices and demographics of a population of psychedelic microdosers - including their psychiatric diagnoses, prescription medications, and recreational substance use patterns - to develop a foundation on which to conduct future clinical research. METHODS: Participants (n = 909; M(age) = 26.9, SD = 8.6; male = 83.2%; White/European = 79.1%) recruited primarily from the online forum Reddit completed an anonymous online survey. Respondents who reported using LSD, psilocybin, or both for microdosing were grouped and compared with non-microdosing respondents using exploratory odds ratio testing on demographic variables, rates of psychiatric diagnoses, and past-year recreational substance use. RESULTS: Of microdosers, most reported using LSD (59.3%; M(dose) = 13 mcg, or 11.3% of one tab) or psilocybin (25.9%; M(dose) = 0.3 g of dried psilocybin mushrooms) on a one-day-on, two-days-off schedule. Compared with non-microdosers, microdosers were significantly less likely to report a history of substance use disorders (SUDs; OR = 0.17 (95% CI: 0.05-0.56)) or anxiety disorders (OR = 0.61 (95% CI: 0.41-0.91)). Microdosers were also more likely to report recent recreational substance use compared with non-microdosers (OR = 5.2 (95% CI: 2.7-10.8)). CONCLUSIONS: Well-designed randomized controlled trials are needed to evaluate the safety and tolerability of this practice in clinical populations and to test claims about potential benefits."

The methods included solid-phase extraction of urine, concentration of eluent, derivatisation, and quantitative analysis by gas chromatography/ mass spectrometry (GC/MS) on a capillary column in the electron impact and selected ion monitoring (SIM) mode. Sensitivity, reproducibility, and accuracy were determined for all analytes (limit of detection between 3 and 12 ng/ml, precision <10%, accuracy >92%). The accuracy was checked through analysis of standard reference materials and participation in an international quality assessment programme. The methods were used in the analysis of spot urine samples of 60 subjects suspected of drug abuse. Negative findings indicated several disadvantages of urine as a biological sample."
"3609","1","Sequential regional cerebral blood flow brain scans using PET with H₂¹⁵O demonstrate ketamine actions in CNS dynamically.^\nPresents the analysis of acute ketamine (KM) action on regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) changes over time in a cohort of normal healthy Ss. 13 Ss received a 0.3 mg/kg intravenous dose of KM over 60 sec; 10 Ss received placebo in the same manner. For each S, 3 baseline PET rCBF scans and 7 sequential post-KM scans at 10-min intervals were obtained. Different analysis of the data show several distinctive aspects of the drug-induced rCBF changes over time. Elaborated by quantitative kinetic analysis, the dynamic sequential analysis of PET images and their cluster criteria provides an overall description of the location, extent and duration of a time-dependent KM drug effect. The lack of any significant clusters in the placebo condition or any cluster growth and regression over time suggests that the activation/reduction patterns depicted here are associated with KM drug action. The direct action of a centrally active drug can be assessed regionally and dynamically in brain using rCBF and a scan sequence optimally timed to complement the drug's time course. KM pharmacodynamics can be related to concurrent behavioral changes, tending to link the behavior with a brain region. This experimental design provides direct characterization of drug action in the CNS. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"6515","1","LSD and ketanserin and their impact on the human autonomic nervous system.^\nThe interest in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) has sparked again due to its supposed positive effects on psychopathological conditions. Yet, most research focuses on the actions of LSD on the central nervous system. The interaction with the autonomic nervous system (ANS) has been neglected so far. Therefore, the aim was to assess the effects of LSD and the serotonin 2A receptor antagonist ketanserin on the ANS as assessed by heart rate variability (HRV) measures and their correlation with subjective drug-induced effects in a randomized, placebo-controlled crossover trial. Thus, ANS activity was derived from electrocardiogram recordings after intake of placebo, LSD or ketanserin, and LSD by calculating R-peak-based measures of sympathetic and parasympathetic activity. Repeated measure ANOVA and partial correlation for HRV measures and subjective experience questionnaires were performed. LSD predominantly increased sympathetic activity, while ketanserin counteracted this effect on the ANS via an increase of parasympathetic tone. Sympathetic activity was positively and parasympathetic activity negatively associated with psychedelic effects of LSD. Furthermore, Placebo HRV measures predicted subjective experiences after LSD intake. The association between trait ANS activity and LSD-induced subjective experiences may serve as a candidate biomarker set for the effectiveness of LSD in the treatment of psychopathological conditions."
"1709","1","Predictors of <i>Salvia divinorum</i> Use Among a National Sample of Entering First-year U.S. College Students.^\nObjective: Past epidemiological studies have revealed that 18- to 25-year-olds have the highest rate of Salvia divinorum (salvia) use. This study examines predictors of salvia use among a large national sample of incoming first-year college students attending 144 academic institutions. Method: Each institution instructed their entering first-year students to complete an online alcohol course. A total of 7,314 randomly selected students completed a version of the course's baseline survey that included questions about salvia use. Results: Salvia use in the past two weeks was reported by 3.5%. In a multivariate model, past-two-week salvia use was more common among students who were male, non-White, and had an absent father; this study did not correct for multiple statistical tests, and therefore, these results may be spurious. Salvia use and use of cigarettes and marijuana were strongly related in bivariate analyses. Current drinkers were approximately two times more likely to use salvia in the past two weeks. More than a third of those reporting past-two-week salvia use reported using salvia while under the influence of marijuana in the past month. Discussion: This study is the first to examine salvia and other substance use over the past two weeks and explores the use of salvia under the influence of marijuana. Students being disciplined for marijuana-related offenses should be questioned about the concomitant use of salvia."
"3492","1","Nature-themed video intervention may improve cardiovascular safety of psilocybin-assisted therapy for alcohol use disorder.^\nINTRODUCTION: Psychedelic-assisted therapy with psilocybin has shown promise in Phase 2 trials for alcohol use disorder (AUD). Set and setting, particularly factors facilitating a connection with nature, may positively influence the psychedelic experience and therapeutic outcomes. But to date, randomized controlled trials of interventions to enhance set and setting for psychedelic-assisted therapy are lacking. METHODS: This was a pilot randomized, controlled trial of Visual Healing, a nature-themed video intervention to optimize set and setting, versus Standard set and setting procedures with two open-label psilocybin 25 mg dosing sessions among 20 participants with AUD. For the first session, participants randomized to Visual Healing viewed nature-themed videos during the preparation session and the ""ascent"" and ""descent"" phases of the psilocybin dosing session while participants randomized to the Standard condition completed a meditation during the preparatory session and wore eyeshades and listened to a music playlist throughout the dosing session. For the second session 4 weeks later, participants chose either Visual Healing or Standard procedures. Primary outcomes were feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing. Secondary and exploratory outcomes were changes in alcohol use, psychedelic effects, anxiety and stress. RESULTS: Nineteen of 20 (95%) randomized participants (mean age 49 ± 11 years, 60% female) completed the 14-week study. During the first psilocybin session, participants viewed an average of 37.9 min of the 42-min video and there were no video-related adverse events. Peak increase in post-psilocybin blood pressure was significantly less for participants randomly assigned to Visual Healing compared to Standard procedures. Alcohol use decreased significantly in both Visual Healing and Standard groups and psychedelic effects, stress, and anxiety were similar between groups. DISCUSSION: In this open-label pilot study, viewing Visual Healing videos during preparation and psilocybin dosing sessions was feasible, safe, and well-tolerated among participants with AUD. Preliminary findings suggest that Visual Healing has potential to reduce the cardiovascular risks of psychedelic therapy, without interfering with the psychedelic experience or alcohol-related treatment outcomes. Studies to replicate our findings as well as studies of different set and setting interventions with other psychedelic medications and indications are warranted."
"4507","1","Dreamlike effects of LSD on waking imagery in humans depend on serotonin 2A receptor activation.^\nRATIONALE: Accumulating evidence indicates that the mixed serotonin and dopamine receptor agonist lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) induces an altered state of consciousness that resembles dreaming. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD produces dreamlike waking imagery and that this imagery depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. METHODS: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audiorecorded guided mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). Cognitive bizarreness of guided mental imagery reports was quantified as a standardised formal measure of dream mentation. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. RESULTS: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased cognitive bizarreness (p < 0.001). The LSD-induced increase in cognitive bizarreness was positively correlated with the LSD-induced loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control (p < 0.05). Both LSD-induced increases in cognitive bizarreness and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. CONCLUSIONS: LSD produced mental imagery similar to dreaming, primarily via activation of the 5-HT2A receptor and in relation to loss of self-boundaries and cognitive control. Future psychopharmacological studies should assess the differential contribution of the D2/D1 and 5-HT1A receptors to cognitive bizarreness."

Moreover, the number of schizophrenic patients who also use hallucinogenic drugs is increasing. High incidence and comorbidity cause clinical problems and call for detailed knowledge of the drug related acute and chronic effects of the various agents currently in use.

"365","0","Ketamine for Depression, 6: Effects on Suicidal Ideation and Possible Use as Crisis Intervention in Patients at Suicide Risk.^\nA growing body of literature suggests that ketamine, administered in subanesthetic doses, has early-onset antidepressant action in patients with severe and even treatment-refractory depression. Many case reports, open-label studies, and randomized controlled trials (RCTs) suggest that ketamine may have dramatic antisuicidal effects, as well. This article examines the benefits of ketamine in patients with suicidal ideation with particular focus on the findings of recent RCTs and meta-analyses. Important findings are that a single dose of ketamine is associated with antisuicidal benefits that emerge within an hour of administration and persist for up to a week. The benefits are seen in patients with mild as well as clinically significant suicidal ideation. The benefits are observed in midazolam- as well as saline-controlled trials. Effect sizes are medium to large. The improvement in suicidal ideation is only partly explained by improvement in depression severity. It is concluded that there is consistent evidence that a single dose of ketamine has dramatic antisuicidal action that emerges almost immediately after dosing and persists for at least a week. The short- and intermediate-term safety and efficacy of ketamine as a crisis intervention treatment for suicidal patients merit study. Areas that need research are outlined."
"1941","1","Memory and mood during MDMA intoxication, with and without memantine pretreatment.^\nPrevious studies have shown that single doses of MDMA can affect mood and impair memory in humans. The neuropharmacological mechanisms involved in MDMA-induced memory impairment are not clear. Memantine, an NMDA and alpha 7 nicotinic acetylcholine (ACh) receptor antagonist, was able to reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment in rats. This study investigated whether treatment with memantine can prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in humans. 15 subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo controlled, within-subject design. Subjects received both pre-treatment (placebo/memantine 20 mg) (T1) and treatment (placebo/MDMA 75 mg) (T2) on separate test days. T1 preceded T2 by 120 min. Memory function was assessed 90 min after T2 by means of a Visual Verbal Learning Task, a Prospective Memory Task, the Sternberg Memory Task and the Abstract Visual Pattern Learning Task. Profile of Mood State and psychomotor performance were also assessed to control whether MDMA and memantine interactions would selectively pertain to memory or transfer to other domains as well. MDMA significantly impaired performance in the visual verbal learning task and abstract visual pattern learning task. Pre-treatment with memantine did not prevent MDMA-induced memory impairment in these two tasks. Both positive (vigour, arousal, elation) and negative mood effects (anxiety) were increased by MDMA. The responses were not altered by pretreatment with memantine which had no effect on memory or mood when given alone. These preliminary results suggest that memantine does not reverse MDMA-induced memory impairment and mood in humans. This article is part of the Special Issue entitled 'CNS Stimulants'."

Methods: In a randomized, double-blind, controlled 12-week clinical trial, patients with moderate mood symptoms (HDRS ≥ 18 or YMRS ≥ 14) were recruited. The patients were randomly assigned to a group while still undergoing regular valproate (VPA) treatments: VPA + dextromethorphan (DM) (30 mg/day) + memantine (MM) (5 mg/day) (DM30 + MM5) (n = 66), VPA + DM (30 mg/day) (DM30) (n = 69), VPA + MM (5 mg/day) (MM5) (n = 66), or VPA + Placebo (Placebo) (n = 69). Symptom severity, immunological parameters [plasma tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-α and C-reactive protein (CRP)] and plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) were regularly examined. Metabolic profiles [cholesterol, triglycerides, glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C), fasting serum glucose, body mass index (BMI)] were measured at baseline and at 2, 8, and 12 weeks. Results: Depression scores were significantly (P = 0.03) decreases and BDNF levels significantly (P = 0.04) increased in the DM30 + MM5 group than in the Placebo group. However, neither depressive scores nor BDNF levels were significantly different between the DM30, MM5, and Placebo groups. Changes in certain plasma cytokine and BDNF levels were significantly correlated with metabolic parameters. Conclusion: We concluded that add-on DM30 + MM5 was significantly more effective than placebo for clinical symptoms and plasma BDNF levels. Additional studies with larger samples and mechanistic studies are necessary to confirm our findings. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7748","1","Mismatch negativity encoding of prediction errors predicts S-ketamine-induced cognitive impairments.^\nPsychotomimetics like the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine and the 5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor (5-HT(2A)R) agonist psilocybin induce psychotic symptoms in healthy volunteers that resemble those of schizophrenia. Recent theories of psychosis posit that aberrant encoding of prediction errors (PE) may underlie the expression of psychotic symptoms. This study used a roving mismatch negativity (MMN) paradigm to investigate whether the encoding of PE is affected by pharmacological manipulation of NMDAR or 5-HT(2A)R, and whether the encoding of PE under placebo can be used to predict drug-induced symptoms. Using a double-blind within-subject placebo-controlled design, S-ketamine and psilocybin, respectively, were administrated to two groups of healthy subjects. Psychological alterations were assessed using a revised version of the Altered States of Consciousness (ASC-R) questionnaire. As an index of PE, we computed changes in MMN amplitudes as a function of the number of preceding standards (MMN memory trace effect) during a roving paradigm. S-ketamine, but not psilocybin, disrupted PE processing as expressed by a frontally disrupted MMN memory trace effect. Although both drugs produced positive-like symptoms, the extent of PE processing under placebo only correlated significantly with the severity of cognitive impairments induced by S-ketamine. Our results suggest that the NMDAR, but not the 5-HT(2A)R system, is implicated in PE processing during the MMN paradigm, and that aberrant PE signaling may contribute to the formation of cognitive impairments. The assessment of the MMN memory trace in schizophrenia may allow detecting early phases of the illness and might also serve to assess the efficacy of novel pharmacological treatments, in particular of cognitive impairments."
"7192","1","Dose-related behavioral, subjective, endocrine, and psychophysiological effects of the κ opioid agonist Salvinorin A in humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Salvia divinorum (Salvia) is an increasingly popular recreational drug amongst adolescents and young adults. Its primary active ingredient, Salvinorin A (SA)-a highly selective agonist at the κ opiate receptor-is believed to be one of the most potent naturally occurring hallucinogens. However, there is little experimental data on the effects of SA in humans. METHODS: In a 3-day, double-blind, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced study, the behavioral, subjective, cognitive, psychophysiological, and endocrine effects of 0 mg, 8 mg, and 12 mg of inhaled SA were characterized in 10 healthy individuals who had previously used Salvia. RESULTS: SA produced psychotomimetic effects and perceptual alterations, including dissociative and somaesthetic effects, increased plasma cortisol and prolactin, and reduced resting electroencephalogram spectral power. The SA administration was associated with a rapid increase of its levels in the blood. SA did not produce euphoria, cognitive deficits, or changes in vital signs. The effects were transient and not dose-related. SA administration was very well-tolerated without acute or delayed adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: SA produced a wide range of transient effects in healthy subjects. The perceptual altering effects and lack of euphoric effects would explain its intermittent use pattern. Such a profile would also suggest a low addictive potential similar to other hallucinogens and consistent with κ opiate receptor agonism. Further work is warranted to carefully characterize a full spectrum of its effects in humans, to elucidate the underlying mechanisms involved, and to explore the basis for individual variability in its effects."
"2794","1","A feasibility study of low-dose ketamine for acute management of suicidal ideation.^\nOBJECTIVE: Mood disorders complicated by suicidal ideation (SI) frequently present to the emergency department (ED) for care. Currently, patients with SI in the ED do not typically receive targeted interventions. Ketamine may have a role in treating SI within the ED because subanesthetic doses have rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal properties. METHODS: This single-arm, open-label feasibility study enrolled 14 participants from the ED with acute SI who were awaiting voluntary admission to inpatient psychiatry to receive ketamine at 0.5 mg/kg, administered intravenously. Participants were assessed post administration to evaluate feasibility of administration in the ED and short-term effectiveness. Feasibility was determined by acceptability by patients and physicians as well as tolerability and ability to recruit participants into the study. Efficacy was assessed based on changes in (1) self-reported mood and (2) suicidal ideation pre- and postinfusion of ketamine. RESULTS: All patients reported severe depression and active SI at baseline. No serious adverse events were reported, and acceptability was rated highly by both participants and physicians (>70%). Two hours after receiving ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, the mean SI and somatic symptom burden were decreased compared to baseline (P < 0.001 and P = 0.005, respectively), and the mean self-reported mood was increased (P = 0.006). Improvements in mood and decreases in suicidality persisted at 6 hours. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ketamine was well tolerated, considered feasible by both participants and physicians, and demonstrated short-term efficacy. There is a growing body of evidence demonstrating the feasibility of ketamine administration in the ED, and larger randomized trials should be conducted to establish treatment recommendations for patients with SI in the ED."
"2268","0","Expectancies for Cannabis- Induced Emotional Breakthrough, Mystical Experiences and Changes in Dysfunctional Attitudes: Perceptions of the Potential for Cannabis-Assisted Psychotherapy for Depression.^\nPsychedelic-assisted psychotherapy has established antidepressant effects. Cannabis users appear to expect high doses administered in a session much like psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy to create comparable subjective effects. The current studies explored expectations of antidepressant effects of such cannabis-assisted sessions to replicate and extend previous work. Users not only expected a cannabis-assisted psychotherapy session to decrease depression, but also to alter some of the same mediators of psychedelic or psychological treatments. Over 500 participants in Study I envisioned a cannabis-assisted therapy session akin to those used in psychedelic therapies and reported the effects that they expected on depression as well as relevant subjective reactions. A second sample of over 500 participants responded to identical measures and an index of dysfunctional attitudes that appears to mediate antidepressant effects of psychotherapy. Expectancies of cannabis-induced antidepressant effects covaried with expected psychedelic effects. Participants also envisioned that cannabis-assisted therapy would alter dysfunctional attitudes, which served as a separate, unique path to expected antidepressant effects unrelated to the subjective effects of psychedelics. These results add support to arguments for relevant clinical trials of cannabis-assisted psychotherapy and suggest that cannabis users would expect it to work in ways similar to psychedelics as well as cognitive therapy."
"5381","1","Psilocybin induces acute and persisting alterations in immune status in healthy volunteers: An experimental, placebo-controlled study.^\nPatients characterized by stress-related disorders such as depression display elevated circulating concentrations of pro-inflammatory cytokines and a hyperactive HPA axis. Psychedelics are demonstrating promising results in treatment of such disorders, however the mechanisms of their therapeutic effects are still unknown. To date the evidence of acute and persisting effects of psychedelics on immune functioning, HPA axis activity in response to stress, and associated psychological outcomes is preliminary. To address this, we conducted a placebo-controlled, parallel group design comprising of 60 healthy participants who received either placebo (n = 30) or 0.17 mg/kg psilocybin (n = 30). Blood samples were taken to assess acute and persisting (7 day) changes in immune status. Seven days' post-administration, participants in each treatment group were further subdivided: 15 underwent a stress induction protocol, and 15 underwent a control protocol. Ultra-high field (7-Tesla) magnetic resonance spectroscopy was used to assess whether acute changes in glutamate or glial activity were associated with changes in immune functioning. Finally, questionnaires assessed persisting self-report changes in mood and social behavior. Psilocybin immediately reduced concentrations of the pro-inflammatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), while other inflammatory markers (interleukin (IL)- 1β, IL-6, and C-reactive protein (CRP)) remained unchanged. Seven days later, TNF-α concentrations returned to baseline, while IL-6 and CRP concentrations were persistently reduced in the psilocybin group. Changes in the immune profile were related to acute neurometabolic activity as acute reductions in TNF-α were linked to lower concentrations of glutamate in the hippocampus. Additionally, the more of a reduction in IL-6 and CRP seven days after psilocybin, the more persisting positive mood and social effects participants reported. Regarding the stress response, after a psychosocial stressor, psilocybin did not significantly alter the stress response. Results are discussed in regards to the psychological and therapeutic effects of psilocybin demonstrated in ongoing patient trials."

Design Eight middle schools were assigned randomly to a program or control condition. The randomized controlled trial followed participants through 15 waves of data, from ages 11-28 years. This longitudinal study design includes four separate periods of development from early adolescence to early adulthood. Setting The intervention took place in middle schools. Participants A total of 1002 adolescents from one large mid-western US city were the participants in the study. Intervention The intervention was a multi-component community-based program delivered in early adolescence with a primary emphasis on tobacco, alcohol and marijuana use. Measures At each wave of data collection participants completed a self-report survey that included questions about life-time amphetamine use. Findings Compared to a control group, participants in the Midwestern Prevention Project (MPP) intervention condition had reduced growth (slope) in amphetamine use in emerging adulthood, a lower amphetamine use intercept at the commencement of the early adulthood and delayed amphetamine use initiation. Conclusions The pattern of results suggests that the program worked first to prevent amphetamine use, and then to maintain the preventive effect into adulthood. Study findings suggest that early adolescent substance use prevention programs that focus initially on the 'gateway' drugs have utility for long-term prevention of amphetamine use."

Yet, few cannabis-specific interventions have been examined in Europe. The Cannabis Cessation Program (CCP) was developed in Sweden in the 1990s and has been implemented in some Norwegian municipalities. The present study aimed to examine outcomes of this intervention in the Norwegian setting. METHOD: The respondents (N = 102) were recruited in four community-based CCPs in Norway. We examined their changes in cannabis use, other substance use, mental distress, well-being, sense of coherence (SoC), and social networks, from baseline (T0) to post-treatment (T1) and up to a 3-month follow-up period (T2). Changes were evaluated with pair-wise t-tests. RESULT: Seventy-six participants (75%) completed the 8-week program, according to plan. All participants reported a significant reduction in cannabis use at T1 (average reduction ~16 days per month) and at T2 (N = 59; ~13 days per month). Among those that completed the program, 67% was abstinent from cannabis at T1 and 37% was abstinent at T2. An intention-to-treat analysis showed that 50% (51/102) and 22% (22/102) were abstinent from cannabis use at T1 and T2, respectively. In parallel to abstinence, we observed a substantial reduction in mental distress and an increase in well-being and SoC. Respondents socialized with fewer friends with current substance use, but drug-free social networks were not expanded. CONCLUSION: Our findings suggested that the CCP was a valuable, low-threshold manual-based intervention for cannabis use disorders. It showed considerable potential for reducing individuals' cannabis use. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: Clinicaltrials.gov no. NCT04989205.

"7219","1","An association between the regular use of 3,4 methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (Ecstasy) and excessive wear of the teeth.^\nAims. This study was established to determine if users of ecstasy had greater tooth wear than a comparison group of non-users. Design. The study involved a direct comparison between two groups of young people gathered by a peer information network and divided by the response to the question 'Do you take ecstasy?' Setting. The information network was established at the Maryland Centre in Liverpool (UK). Besides offering advice on drug and sex-related problems this centre distributes free condoms and is therefore visited by many young people who would not consider themselves to have these problems. Participants. There were 30 users and 28 non-users with no significant difference in the gender ratio. Age was not recorded to maintain absolute confidentiality, but all the participants appeared to be of student age. Measurements. Tooth wear was measured using the index of Smith and Knight. The social and drug-taking profile of the two groups was ascertained by questionnaire. Findings. It was found that the mean (± STD) tooth wear score for the back teeth was 0.96 ± 0.16 in the users compared with 0.12 ± 0.08 for the comparison group. These values were significantly different (p < 0. 001). The values for the front teeth were not significantly different. Many users were aware of clenching their teeth 12 or even 24 hours after taking the drug. Conclusion. Taking ecstasy results in an increased likelihood of tooth wear on the back teeth. This is likely to result from clenching the teeth in the acidic environment caused by carbonated (fizzy) drinks."
"3408","1","Hyponatraemic states following 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy') ingestion.^\nBackground: Life-threatening and fatal hyponatraemic complications following ecstasy use have previously been documented. Aim: To define clinical features of hyponatraemia following the ingestion of 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA, 'ecstasy'). Design: Retrospective case series. Methods: All enquiries to the London centre of the National Poisons Information Service (NPIS) between December 1993 and March 1996 were screened for cases of MDMA use associated with hyponatraemia (serum sodium <130 mmol/l). History of fluid consumption, presenting features and subsequent clinical course were recorded. Results: Seventeen patients, aged 15-26 years, were identified. Serum sodium levels ranged between 107 mmol/l and 128 mmol/l. In six patients, biochemical results were consistent with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone (SIADH). Analytical confirmation of MDMA ingestion was obtained in 10 patients. Ten patients were known to have ingested a large amount of non-alcoholic or alcoholic fluid. The clinical pattern was remarkably uniform, with initial vomiting and disturbed behaviour, followed in 11 patients by seizures. Drowsiness, a mute state and disorientation were observed for up to 3 days. Two patients died; 14 made a complete recovery. Discussion: MDMA can cause life-threatening hyponatraemic encephalopathy when accompanied by excessive fluid ingestion. The mechanism involves inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone."

They were asked to describe their flashbacks, events triggering them, and their personal theory of why flashbacks occur. Their drug taking history, motives for taking drugs, and personal changes due to drugs were compared with psychedelic drug users not having flashbacks. Flashbackers, non-flashbackers, and non-drug taking controls were compared on self-descriptive adjectives, extent they sought help for mental health problems, and various demographic data. One year later subjects were again interviewed to assess changes due to time. Subjective accounts are included to clarify findings regarding the flashback phenomena."

"7913","1","Effects of monoamine oxidase inhibitor and cytochrome P450 2D6 status on 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine metabolism and pharmacokinetics.^\n5-Methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT) is a natural psychoactive indolealkylamine drug that has been used for recreational purpose. Our previous study revealed that polymorphic cytochrome P450 2D6 (CYP2D6) catalyzed 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation to produce active metabolite bufotenine, while 5-MeO-DMT is mainly inactivated through deamination pathway mediated by monoamine oxidase (MAO). This study, therefore, aimed to investigate the impact of CYP2D6 genotype/phenotype status and MAO inhibitor (MAOI) on 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics. Enzyme kinetic studies using recombinant CYP2D6 allelic isozymes showed that CYP2D6.2 and CYP2D6.10 exhibited 2.6- and 40-fold lower catalytic efficiency (Vmax/Km), respectively, in producing bufotenine from 5-MeO-DMT, compared with wild-type CYP2D6.1. When co-incubated with MAOI pargyline, 5-MeO-DMT O-demethylation in 10 human liver microsomes showed significantly strong correlation with bufuralol 1′-hydroxylase activities (R2=0.98; P<0.0001) and CYP2D6 contents (R2=0.77; P=0.0007), whereas no appreciable correlations with enzymatic activities of other P450 enzymes. Furthermore, concurrent MAOI harmaline sharply reduced 5-MeO-DMT depletion and increased bufotenine formation in human CYP2D6 extensive metabolizer hepatocytes. In vivo studies in wild-type and CYP2D6-humanized (Tg-CYP2D6) mouse models showed that Tg-CYP2D6 mice receiving the same dose of 5-MeO-DMT (20mg/kg, i.p.) had 60% higher systemic exposure to metabolite bufotenine. In addition, pretreatment of harmaline (5mg/kg, i.p.) led to 3.6- and 4.4-fold higher systemic exposure to 5-MeO-DMT (2mg/kg, i.p.), and 9.9- and 6.1-fold higher systemic exposure to bufotenine in Tg-CYP2D6 and wild-type mice, respectively. These findings indicate that MAOI largely affects 5-MeO-DMT metabolism and pharmacokinetics, as well as bufotenine formation that is mediated by CYP2D6. © 2010 Elsevier Inc."
"847","0","Single-Session Dance/Movement Therapy for People with Acute Schizophrenia: Development of a Treatment Protocol.^\nPeople experiencing acute symptomatology associated with schizophrenia require interventions that support stabilization. Dance/movement therapy (DMT) can be a promising treatment option for this population due to the potential for verbal communication difficulties, alternative reality bases, and movement dysfunctions associated with schizophrenia. However, due to the improvisational nature of DMT, it is often difficult to identify the specific interventions or components of the therapeutic process that may support stabilization and symptom reduction. Moreover, as inpatient lengths of stay decrease, it is imperative that we implement shorter treatment protocols. This inquiry analyzed 14 single-session DMT group sessions for people with acute schizophrenia on an inpatient psychiatric unit to determine the components of the DMT process common amongst each session. Data analysis of therapist field notes informed the development of a single-session DMT treatment protocol to outline the four phases of a single-session DMT group: warm-up, thematic development, cool down, and verbal discussion. Results of this inquiry determined that there were repeated components of the 14 sessions. A systematic content analysis of the therapy process is potentially useful for the examination of what may specifically contribute to symptom reduction in DMT groups."
"3555","1","The effects of ketamine on symptoms of depression and anxiety in real-world care settings: A retrospective controlled analysis.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine intravenous therapy (KIT) appears effective for treating depression in controlled trials testing a short series of infusions. A rapidly proliferating number of clinics offer KIT for depression and anxiety, using protocols without a strong evidence basis. Controlled comparison of mood and anxiety from real-world KIT clinics, and the stability of outcomes, is lacking. METHODS: We performed a retrospective controlled analysis on patients treated with KIT in ten community clinics across the US, between 08/2017-03/2020. Depression and anxiety symptoms were evaluated using the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self Report 16-item (QIDS) and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder 7-item (GAD-7) scales, respectively. Comparison data sets from patients who did not undergo KIT were obtained from previously published real-world studies. RESULTS: Of 2758 patients treated, 714 and 836 met criteria for analysis of KIT induction and maintenance outcomes, respectively. Patients exhibited significant and concordant reduction in both anxiety and depression symptoms after induction (Cohen's d = -1.17 and d = -1.56, respectively). Compared to two external datasets of KIT-naive depressed patients or patients starting standard antidepressant therapy, KIT patients experienced a significantly greater reduction in depression symptoms at eight weeks (Cohen's d = -1.03 and d = -0.62 respectively). Furthermore, we identified a subpopulation of late-responders. During maintenance, up to a year post-induction, increases in symptoms were minimal. LIMITATIONS: Due to the retrospective nature of the analyses, interpreting this dataset is limited by incomplete patient information and sample attrition. CONCLUSIONS: KIT treatment elicited robust symptomatic relief that remained stable up to one year of follow-up."
"7052","1","Changes in resting-state global brain connectivity in LSD-induced altered states of consciousness are attributable to the 5-HT2A receptor.^\nBackground: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a prototypical psychedelic drug with agonist activity at various serotonin (5‐HT) and dopamine receptors. Despite the therapeutic and scientific interest in LSD, the specific receptor contributions in particular to changes in brain connectivity have not been studied yet. Methods: In a double‐blind, randomized, counterbalanced, cross‐over study 24 healthy participants received either 1) placebo1placebo, 2) placebo1LSD (100 mg po), or 3) ketanserin‐a selective 5‐HT2A receptor antagonist (40 mg po)1LSD (100 mg po) in three different sessions. Resting‐state FMRI scans were acquired 75 and 300 minutes after the second substance administration. We analyzed resting‐state functional connectivity with a data‐driven global brain connectivity (GBC) method to facilitate discovery. Results: LSD administration caused widespread alterations of GBC across cortical and subcortical regions. LSD decreased GBC in fronto‐medial and lateral areas, as well as basal ganglia, but increased GBC in the occipital, temporal, and parietal cortex. Similar patterns were found when comparing LSD with ketanserin1LSD. Negligible differences were observed when comparing ketanserin1LSD and placebo. Conclusions: Results revealed that LSD induces widespread GBC alterations that are predominantly attributable to its agonistic activity onto the 5‐HT2A receptor. While LSD reduces connectivity in attention networks, it increased connectivity across sensory areas. Present results inform psychedelics' mechanism of action pinpointing targets of therapeutic value and reinforce use of data‐driven neuroimaging methods for pharmacological imaging."
"6627","0","Reasons for recent marijuana use in relation to use of other illicit drugs among high school seniors in the United States.^\nObjectives: Studies show that illicit cannabis (marijuana) use is related to use of other illicit drugs and that reasons for use are related to frequency of marijuana use. However, research is needed to examine whether specific reasons for marijuana use are associated with use of other illicit drugs. Methods: Data from recent marijuana-using high school seniors were examined from 12 cohorts of Monitoring the Future (Weighted n=6481) to examine whether reasons for recent marijuana use are associated with use of eight other illicit drugs. Results: Using ""to experiment"" decreased odds of reporting use of each drug and using to decrease effects of other drugs increased odds of reporting use of each drug. In multivariable models, using marijuana ""to experiment"" decreased the odds for reporting use of hallucinogens other than LSD and narcotics other than heroin. Using marijuana for ""insight"" increased the odds for use of hallucinogens other than LSD, and use due to ""boredom"" increased the odds for reporting use of powder cocaine and hallucinogens other than LSD. Using marijuana to increase effects of other drugs increased odds of reporting use of each of the eight drugs, and using it to decrease other drug effects increased odds of reporting use of crack, hallucinogens other than LSD, and amphetamine/stimulants. Conclusions: This study helped identify illicit marijuana users who are more likely to report use of other illicit drugs. Prevention efforts need to focus on students who report certain reasons for marijuana use as they may be at risk for use of other illicit drugs."
"7723","0","The Potential of Psychedelics for the Treatment of Episodic Migraine.^\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review presents the existing literature of and a framework for how psychedelic drugs might be applied as therapeutic agents in episodic migraine. RECENT FINDINGS: The therapeutic effects of psychedelics in headache disorders have been reported for decades and controlled investigations are now beginning. In the first and only clinical trial of a psychedelic drug in migraine, the single administration of low-dose psilocybin reduced weekly migraine days and pain intensity for the following 2 weeks in episodic subjects. These transitional effects, along with abortive effects in two subjects and additional findings in cluster headache, offer insight into the potential medicinal use of this and other psychedelic drugs in episodic migraine. The existing evidence supports the continued investigation of psilocybin and other psychedelics as transitional treatments in episodic migraine. Acute and preventive effects also exist, but the risks may outweigh benefits with these applications. Future research of psychedelics in episodic migraine should be tailored for this condition and not modeled after protocols used in other medical or psychiatric conditions."
"7077","1","Effects of intravenous ketamine on explicit and implicit measures of suicidality in treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Intravenous ketamine has shown rapid antidepressant effects in early trials, making it a potentially attractive candidate for depressed patients at imminent risk of suicide. The Implicit Association Test (IAT), a performance-based measure of association between concepts, may have utility in suicide assessment. METHODS: Twenty-six patients with treatment-resistant depression were assessed using the suicidality item of the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS-SI) 2 hours before and 24 hours following a single subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine. Ten patients also completed IATs assessing implicit suicidal associations at comparable time points. In a second study, nine patients received thrice-weekly ketamine infusions over a 12-day period. RESULTS: Twenty-four hours after a single infusion, MADRS-SI scores were reduced on average by 2.08 points on a 0 to 6 scale (p < .001; d = 1.37), and 81% of patients received a rating of 0 or 1 postinfusion. Implicit suicidal associations were also reduced following ketamine (p = .003; d = 1.36), with reductions correlated across implicit and explicit measures. MADRS-SI reductions were sustained for 12 days by repeated-dose ketamine (p < .001; d = 2.42). CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings support the premise that ketamine has rapid beneficial effects on suicidal cognition and warrants further study."
"2518","1","Ketamine metabolites with antidepressant effects: Fast, economical, and eco-friendly enantioselective separation based on supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) and single quadrupole MS detection.^\nIncreasing evidence accumulates that metabolites of the dissociative anesthetic ketamine contribute considerably to the biological effects of this drug and could be developed as next generation antidepressants, especially for acute treatment of patients with therapy-refractory major depression. Analytical methods for the simultaneous determination of the plethora of hydroxylated, dehydrogenated and/or demethylated compounds formed after administration of ketamine hydrochloride are a prerequisite for future clinical investigations and a deeper understanding of the individual role of the isomers of these metabolites. In this study, we present development and validation of a method based on supercritical-fluid chromatography (SFC) coupled to single quadrupole MS detection that allows the separation of ketamine as well as all of its relevant metabolites detected in urine of healthy volunteers. Inherently to SFC methods, the run times of the novel protocol are four times shorter than in a comparable HPLC method, the use of organic solvents is reduced and we were able to demonstrate and validate the successful enantioselective separation and quantification of R- and S-ketamine, R- and S-norketamine, R- and S-dehydronorketamine and (2R,6R)- and (2S,6S)-hydroxynorketamine isomers differing in either constitution, stereochemistry, or both, in one run. The developed method may be useful in investigating the antidepressant efficacy of ketamine in clinical trials."
"7027","0","Structure-Activity Assessment and In-Depth Analysis of Biased Agonism in a Set of Phenylalkylamine 5-HT2A Receptor Agonists.^\nSerotonergic psychedelics are described to have activation of the serotonin 2A receptor (5-HT2A) as their main pharmacological action. Despite their relevance, the molecular mechanisms underlying the psychedelic effects induced by certain 5-HT2A agonists remain elusive. One of the proposed hypotheses is the occurrence of biased agonism, defined as the preferential activation of certain signaling pathways over others. This study comparatively monitored the efficiency of a diverse panel of 4-position-substituted (and N-benzyl-derived) phenylalkylamines to induce recruitment of β-arrestin2 (βarr2) or miniGαq to the 5-HT2A, allowing us to assess structure-activity relationships and biased agonism. All test compounds exhibited agonist properties with a relatively large range of both EC50 and Emax values. Interestingly, the lipophilicity of the 2C-X phenethylamines was correlated with their efficacy in both assays but yielded a stronger correlation in the miniGαq- than in the βarr2-assay. Molecular docking suggested that accommodation of the 4-substituent of the 2C-X analogues in a hydrophobic pocket between transmembrane helices 4 and 5 of 5-HT2A may contribute to this differential effect. Aside from previously used standard conditions (lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) as a reference agonist and a 2 h activation profile to assess a compound’s activity), serotonin was included as a second reference agonist, and the compounds’ activities were also assessed using the first 30 min of the activation profile. Under all assessed circumstances, the qualitative structure-activity relationships remained unchanged. Furthermore, the use of two reference agonists allowed for the estimation of both “benchmark bias” (relative to LSD) and “physiology bias” (relative to serotonin)."

As noted by the authors, the paper does not report any efficacy or safety outcomes for at least 1573 (55.8 %) of the 2848 patients who appeared to have started the at-home ketamine treatment protocol. Why were so many patients excluded from the analysis? No explanation or breakdown is provided. The authors list at least 13 exclusion criteria for this report; do these criteria apply to the administration of at-home ketamine or just to the analysis of the patients in this report?.The authors state in the discussion that 'review of EHR for those excluded due to missing follow-up measures did not reveal any differences in rates of cancellation, dropout, or adverse events.'The authors report a response and remission rates of 62.8 % and 32.6 %, respectively, following 4 sessions of at-home ketamine. This concern is amplified when the authors attempt to make comparisons with other reports that used much more rigorous forms of data collection. Again, we applaud the authors' attempts at reporting real-world data and the journal for the willingness to publish this form of data; the field needs more of this. However, we also point out that the report did not show that the protocol was safe nor effective. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"
"8285","0","Investigating the 'bath salt' panic: the rarity of synthetic cathinone use among students in the United States.^\nINTRODUCTION AND AIMS: Until recently, synthetic cathinones marketed as 'bath salts' were legally sold at convenience stores and online in the USA. Media reports initiated concerns of a growing 'bath salt' epidemic. Despite media attention and the recent legal action banning synthetic cathinones, little is known about its prevalence or users. DESIGN AND METHODS: A self-report survey was administered to 2349 students in 40 randomly selected courses at a large university in the Southeastern United States. The resulting sample was 51.6% female, 68.9% white, 24.4% black, 2.8% Hispanic and 4.0% other races, with a mean age of 20.06 years and median family income of $75 000-99 999. RESULTS: Only 25 (1.07%) of the students reported using synthetic cathinones at least once. Synthetic cathinone use was found to be more common among men (1.68% vs. 0.50% of women, P = 0.005), Hispanics (4.7%) and Native Americans (4.3% vs. 0.89% of whites and 0.72% of blacks, P = 0.002), and student athletes (4.0% vs. 0.90% of non-athletes, P = 0.001), but in each of these groups, synthetic cathinones were used more rarely than marijuana (58.14%, P < 0.001), cocaine (9.08%, P < 0.001), Salvia divinorum (7.89%, P < 0.001), synthetic cannabinoids (14.28%, P < 0.001), methamphetamines (1.92%, P = 0.002), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methylamphetamine (MDMA) (12.54%, P < 0.001) and several other drugs and pharmaceuticals. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS: 'Bath salts' have received a great deal of media attention in the USA, yet the prevalence of synthetic cathinone use among our sample was extremely rare. We suggest that the media attention focusing on synthetic cathinone use as a growing epidemic may be largely misplaced."
"4070","1","Powerful substances in tiny amounts: An interview study of psychedelic microdosing.^\nAims: This article presents a qualitative interview study of people who microdose with psychedelic drugs, which means that the user takes about one tenth of an ordinary recreational dose. Design: Respondents (n = 21) were recruited at several Internet fora for individual interviews via private messaging. Every participant was male, and the median respondent was in his 30s with a stable job and relationship and extensive entheogen experience. Results: Respondents tended to experiment with microdosing in phases, reporting mostly positive consequences from this form of drug use. Reported effects included improved mood, cognition, and creativity, which often served to counteract symptoms especially from conditions of anxiety and depression. There were also reports of various challenges with psychedelic microdosing, and some did not find the practice worth continuing. Conclusion: The study obtained evidence of a group of users taking small doses of psychedelics not for the purpose of intoxication but to enhance everyday functioning. While the study's findings are not generalisable, they may inform subsequent investigations with research questions and hypotheses."
"3406","1","Psychedelic Microdosing, Mindfulness, and Anxiety: A Cross-Sectional Mediation Study.^\nWhile anecdotal reports claim that psychedelic microdosing reduces anxiety and mood symptoms, evidence supporting these claims is scarce. This cross-sectional study investigated the association between microdosing and trait anxiety. Furthermore, it was investigated if trait mindfulness mediated this association. Participants completed anonymous online questionnaires and were divided into three groups: current microdosers (n = 186), former microdosers (n = 77) and microdosing-naïve controls (n = 234). Trait anxiety and trait mindfulness were measured using the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory–Trait subscale (STAI-T) and the 15-item Five-Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ-15) respectively. Current and former microdosers reported lower STAI-T scores compared to microdosing-naïve controls. Furthermore, associations of current and former microdosing with trait anxiety were mediated by trait mindfulness, with small effects of FFMQ-15 Total, Non-judging and Non-reactivity scores. However, in an exploratory analysis, all associations between microdosing and STAI-T scores became non-significant when participants with previous macrodose experience (n = 386) were excluded. Our findings suggest that RCT<apos;>s are warranted to test causal hypotheses concerning the effects of microdosing and the role of trait mindfulness in the effects of microdosing, while controlling for previous macrodose experience."

The aim of this narrative review is to synthesize the available literature on the administration of ketamine for PPD and propose ketamine as a viable and advantageous treatment. METHODS: A search was conducted on MEDLINE/PubMed, PsycInfo, and Embase databases from inception to October 10, 2021 for preclinical studies, interventional studies (ie, open-label and randomized controlled trials), as well as systematic reviews and meta-analyses evaluating the use of ketamine in postpartum populations. Completed and ongoing clinical trials were identified on ClinicalTrials.gov. RESULTS: Four clinical trials were identified. Results from this review support additional investigation into ketamine as a potential treatment for PPD. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine may be a favorable option for treating PPD due to its antidepressive and analgesic effects, short infusion time, and rapid clearance from the maternal bloodstream. However, there is insufficient evidence to support its use in this population, underscoring the importance of additional clinical research investigating ketamine for PPD."

Patients with TRD were randomized in a double-blind fashion to a single infusion of IV ketamine or IV midazolam placebo. Suicidal ideation was measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) suicide item at 3, 5, 7, 14 and 30 days post infusion. Clinically significant suicidal ideation was defined as a MADRS suicide item score ≥2. Forty patients who received IV ketamine and 16 who received IV midazolam had suicide item scores of ≥2 at baseline (IV ketamine group mean 2.90±0.74; IV midazolam group 2.69±0.70). The mean suicide scores of these groups differed significantly from each other on day 30; the IV ketamine group had a lower mean score than controls (2.03±1.59 vs. 3.00±1.41, t-test p = 0.049; Hedges' g 0.71). Among patients with a suicide score of ≥2 at baseline and <2 at day 3, the two groups did not differ significantly on mean scores changes at days 3, 5, 7, 14 or 30. Recurrence of suicidal ideation was extensive in both treatment groups. A single infusion of IV ketamine may reduce suicidal ideation in TRD out to 30 days post infusion, but early anti-suicidal effects appear to diminish rapidly. This post-hoc analysis was not powered to compare different doses of ketamine. A single infusion of IV ketamine might have a role as an adjunct to standard treatments in patients with TRD and suicidal ideation. Trial registration: NCT01920555."

"8751","1","Intravenous esketamine leads to an increase in impulsive and suicidal behaviour in a patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder.^\nObjectives: As clinical studies demonstrated that ketamine possesses rapid-acting antidepressant and antisuicidal effects, it is increasingly used in affective disorders. The neuroplastic properties of ketamine are well described in preclinical and imaging studies, and are highly related to its antidepressive mechanism of action.Methods: Here, we report on a female patient with recurrent major depression and borderline personality disorder (BPD) who was treated with intravenous (i.v.) esketamine as rapid-acting augmentation therapy to improve severe and acute depressive symptoms and suicidal behaviour.Results: Esketamine led to an initial improvement of these symptoms. However, during the course of treatment, loosened and disinhibited behaviour and severe suicidal ideation occurred during and immediately after esketamine application. Hence, i.v. esketamine was discontinued, and she further received treatment as usual, which demonstrated to be beneficial.Conclusions: With current knowledge at hand, one cannot exclude esketamine's effects on the equilibrium of neural plasticity in brain networks, potentially initiating undesirable symptoms as impulsive behaviour and emotional dysregulation. Therefore, until investigations focus on efficacy and side effects profile of esketamine in depressed patients with (comorbid) BPD, treatment with this fast-acting medication should be considered with caution in this patient group."

METHODS: A questionnaire was given to all patients attending the genitourinary medicine clinics at two inner city teaching hospitals over 3 months (July to September 2011). The questionnaire was self-completed by patients while waiting to be seen by a clinician. Data were collected on age, gender, gender of sexual partner(s), and previous/current recreational drug use (type/frequency of drugs used). Only data from male respondents have been analysed in this paper. RESULTS: 1328 questionnaires were completed. Of the male respondents (n=729), 475 (65.2%) were identified as non-MSM and 254 (34.8%) were identified as MSM. The mean ± SD age of male respondents was 31 ± 9 years years. Lifetime and last month use of mephedrone, ketamine, volatile nitrites ('poppers'), sildenafil (Viagra), GHB, and GBL were all significantly higher in the MSM group compared to the non-MSM group. Lifetime use of cocaine powder, MDMA, amphetamine, and methamphetamine were also significantly higher in the MSM group; however, there was no significant difference in last month use of these drugs between MSM and non-MSM groups. CONCLUSIONS: Both lifetime and last month use of most recreational drugs was more common in MSM, when compared to non-MSM males. Sexual health clinics may provide an opportunistic encounter to identify patterns of recreational drug use, explore motivations for use, and implement strategies to reduce harms related to drug use. This will require a multidisciplinary approach to address the psychosocial aspects of drug taking behaviours, in combination with healthcare professionals experienced in the management of recreational drug use."

"4049","1","Discriminative stimulus effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in humans trained to discriminate among d-amphetamine, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine and placebo.^\nIn animals, two-choice drug discrimination studies have demonstrated that the behavioral effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) are mediated by dopaminergic and serotonergic systems. In order to delineate the relative role of these systems, three-choice paradigms have been used in animals, with findings indicating a more prominent role for serotonin. Human studies assessing the subjective and physiological effects of MDMA have also indicated a mixed action. To parallel animal studies, the participants in the present study were trained to discriminate among a prototypic dopaminergic agonist, d-amphetamine, a prototypic serotonergic agonist, meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP) and placebo and then were tested with two doses of MDMA. In addition, subjective and physiological effects were measured. The results demonstrated that humans could be trained to discriminate among 20 mg d-amphetamine, 0.75 mg/kg mCPP and placebo. When tested with 1.0 and 1.5 mg/kg, half the participants reported MDMA to be like amphetamine and half like mCPP. There were no clear differences between these two groups in other dimensions, although there was an indication that the individuals who discriminated MDMA as d-amphetamine were more sensitive to the effects of all the drugs. The subjective effects of all three drugs overlapped, although the effects of MDMA appeared more amphetamine-like."
"1352","1","What is the clinical evidence on psilocybin for the treatment of psychiatric disorders? A systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: Psilocybin is a predominant agonist of 5HT(1A) and 5HT(2A/C) receptors and was first isolated in 1958, shortly before it became a controlled substance. Research on the potential therapeutic effects of this compound has recently re-emerged alongside what is being addressed as a psychedelic renaissance. METHODS: In this paper we performed a systematic review of the clinical trials conducted so far regarding the therapeutic effects of psilocybin on psychiatric disorders. The eligibility criteria included clinical trials that assessed psilocybin's potential therapeutic effects on patients with psychiatric disorders. Nine hundred seven articles were found and screened in regard to the title, from which 94 were screened through abstract and 9 met the eligibility criteria and were included. RESULTS: The papers published focused on 3 disorders: depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) and substance use disorder (namely tobacco and alcohol). Psilocybin has shown a relatively safe profile and very promising results, with reductions found on most of the psychiatric rating scales' scores. Research on depression showed the most solid evidence, supported by 3 randomized controlled trials. Studies on OCD and substance use disorder showed more limitations due to their open-label design. CONCLUSIONS: Altogether, the results from the studies reviewed in this paper suggest a substantial therapeutic potential. This calls for further research to confirm the results observed so far and further explain the underlying mechanisms."

In addition to its characteristic psychotropic effects, important cardiovascular effects have been described such as increased blood pressure and heart rate. MDMA was previously shown to behave as a partial agonist on 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) receptors in the human internal thoracic artery in vitro, involving the 5-HT2A subtype. Here, we studied the interaction of MDMA (400, 800 and 1600 μM) with the following 5-HT receptor agonists: 5-carboxamidotryptamine (5-CT, full agonist for the 5-HT1, 5-HT2, 5-HT5, 5-HT6 and 5-HT7 receptors) and sumatriptan (selective 5-HT1B/1D receptors agonist). The results showed the ability of MDMA to influence the concentration-dependent response of 5-CT (97.3% of maximal reduction for 1600 μM of MDMA) and sumatriptan (72.43% of maximal reduction for 1600 μM of MDMA). The lower concentration of MDMA (400 μM) produced a significant potentiation of the response to sumatriptan thus suggesting an interaction of MDMA with the activation of 5-HT receptors, namely of the 5-HT1 subtype, in the peripheral vasculature. Together our results further support the importance of the affinity of MDMA to 5-HT receptors in the vascular effects of this drug."

Breeksema, Sanne Y. Smith-Apeldoorn, Jolien Veraart, Wim van den Brink and Robert A. Schoevers (Psychopharmacology, 2022[Jan], Vol 239[1], 15-33). In the original article, there was an error in the author’s last name. The author’s last name has legally been changed from Schimmel to Schimmers. The original article has been corrected. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2022-08995-001[/rid]). Background: Terminally ill patients may experience existential distress, depression, or anxiety, limiting quality of life in the final stage. Existing psychotherapeutic or pharmacological interventions have (time) limited efficacy. Psychedelic treatment may be a safe and effective alternative treatment option. Aim: Systematically review studies on psychedelic treatment with and without psychotherapy for existential distress, depression, and anxiety in terminally ill patients. Methods: Medline, PsycINFO, and Embase were searched for original-data studies on the treatment of depression, anxiety, and existential distress with classical or a-typical psychedelics in patients with a terminal illness, using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Results: A total of 1850 records were screened, and 33 articles were included in this review: 14 studies on classical psychedelics (DPT, LSD, and psilocybin) and 19 studies on atypical psychedelics (MDMA and ketamine). Results of early pre-post studies are promising but have serious methodological flaws. Recent (controlled) trials with LSD, psilocybin, ketamine, and MDMA are of higher methodological quality and indicate positive effects on existential and spiritual well-being, quality of life, acceptance, and reduction of anxiety and depression with few adverse and no serious adverse effects. Conclusions: Both classical and a-typical psychedelics are promising treatment options in patients with terminal illness. To draw final conclusions on effectiveness and safety of psychedelics, we need larger high-quality studies for classical psychedelics and MDMA. Ketamine studies should pay more attention to existential dimensions of well-being and the psychotherapeutic context of the treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"

The study was a randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted in a hospital-based clinic in Wellington, New Zealand. Thirty-five volunteers who had previously used party pills containing BZP were included in this trial. Participants received one of the following four treatments: 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and placebo, 300 mg/74 mg BZP/TFMPP and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol, placebo and 57.6 g (6 units) alcohol and double placebo. The primary outcome variable was a measure of driving performance, the standard deviation of lateral position (SDLP) measured at 6.5 h. Secondary measures included adverse events, cardiovascular effects, psychological function and delayed effects on sleep. The study was stopped early, after 35 of the planned 64 subjects had undertaken testing, because of severe adverse events that occurred in four of 10 BZP/TFMPP-only subjects, three of seven combined BZP/TFMPP and alcohol subjects, none of the 6 placebo subjects, and none of the 12 alcohol-only subjects. The overall rate of severe adverse events (defined as causing considerable interference with usual activity and/or rated by subject as severe) in those receiving BZP/TFMPP was seven of 17 (41.2%, 95% CI 18.4-67.1). The severe events included agitation, anxiety, hallucinations, vomiting, insomnia and migraine. BZP/TFMPP significantly improved the driving performance, decreasing SDLP at -4.2 cm (95% CI-6.8 to -1.6, P = 0.002). The effect of alcohol was to increase SDLP: 2.3 cm (95% CI-0.3 to 4.9, P = 0.08). BZP/TFMPP also resulted in increased heart rate and blood pressure and in difficulty in getting to sleep. BZP/TFMPP alone or with alcohol carries a significant risk of severe adverse events when taken in similar doses to those recommended by manufacturers."
"633","1","Ketamine-Associated Intraoperative Electroencephalographic Signatures of Elderly Patients With and Without Preoperative Cognitive Impairment.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is typically used by anesthesiologists as an adjunct for general anesthesia and as a nonopioid analgesic. It has been explored for prevention of postoperative delirium, although results have been contradictory. In this study, we investigated the association of ketamine with postoperative delirium and specific encephalographic signatures. Furthermore, we examined these associations in the context of baseline neurocognition as measured by a validated assessment. METHODS: We conducted a prospective observational study from January 2019 to December 2020. Ninety-eight patients aged ≥65 years and undergoing spine surgery scheduled for ≥3 hours were included in the study. All participants who completed the University of California San Francisco (UCSF) Brain Health Assessment preoperatively and postoperatively were assessed with the confusion assessment method for intensive care unit (CAM-ICU) and/or the Nursing Delirium Screening Scale (NuDESC). Patients had frontal electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings (SedLine Root, Masimo, Corp) quantitatively analyzed. We used 60 seconds of artifact-free EEG (without burst suppression) extracted from the middle of the maintenance period to calculate the normalized power spectral density (PSD). Comparisons were made between those who did or did not receive ketamine and according to results from neurocognitive assessments. RESULTS: Ninety-eight patients (of a total of 155, enrolled and consented) had EEG of sufficient quality for analysis (42 women). Overall, we found a significant increase in the EEG power in the moderate frequency range (10-20 Hz) in patients that received ketamine. When the patients were divided by their preoperative cognitive status, this result in the ketamine group only held true for the cognitively normal patients. Patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline did not demonstrate a significant change in EEG characteristics based on ketamine administration, but impaired patients that received ketamine had a significantly higher rate of postoperative delirium (52% ketamine versus 20% no ketamine) (odds ratio [OR], 4.36; confidence interval [CI], 1.02-18.22; P = .048). In patients determined to be preoperatively cognitively normal, the incidence of postoperative delirium was not significantly associated with ketamine administration (19% ketamine versus 17% no ketamine) (OR, 1.10; CI, 0.30-4.04; P = .5833). CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine-related changes in EEG are observed in a heterogeneous group of patients receiving spine surgery. This result was driven primarily by the effect of ketamine on cognitively normal patients and not observed in patients that were cognitively impaired at baseline. Furthermore, patients who were cognitively impaired at baseline and who had received ketamine were more likely to develop postoperative delirium, suggesting that cognitive vulnerability might be predicted by the lack of a neurophysiologic response to ketamine."
"7529","1","Depression and Anxiety Subgroups Across Alcohol Use Disorder and Substance Use in a National Epidemiologic Study.^\nObjective: The high prevalence of alcohol/substance use among individuals with psychiatric disorders elucidates the import of investigations into associations between types and severity of psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. This study examined the likelihood of alcohol use disorder and substance use among individuals with varying depression and anxiety symptoms and severity thereof. Differences across sex were also examined. Methods: Using data from the National Epidemiological Survey on Alcohol and Related Conditions, a nationally representative sample from the United States (N = 43,093), separate logistic regressions estimated the odds of lifetime alcohol use disorder, depressant, stimulant, hallucinogen, and comorbid substance use across psychiatric symptom clusters controlling for age, sex, and ethnicity. Results: Symptom severity was a more important correlate of alcohol use disorder and substance use than symptom type. In particular, the odds ratio of lifetime use of depressants, stimulants, hallucinogens, or any combination of these types of substances were higher for individuals with either severe depression or severe depression and anxiety relative to a healthy control. Moreover, the odds of having a diagnosis of lifetime alcohol use disorder were higher for individuals with severe symptoms of depression, anxiety, and both depression and anxiety, relative to healthy individuals. Those with mild depression were more likely to engage in substance use than individuals with anxiety alone. Patterns of association among males and females were highly consistent. Conclusions: The findings highlight an enhanced risk of alcohol and substance use among individuals with severe depression and/or anxiety symptoms above what is seen among individuals with less severe symptomatology. In addition, this study shows a unique risk posed by the presence of depression on substance use. This study offers a framework for future studies to examine the causal mechanisms explaining the connection between psychiatric symptoms and alcohol/substance use. © 2020, © 2020 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."
"7130","1","Experience integrating ketamine into the healthcare system: outpatient and inpatient treatment of post-partum depression, suicidal ideation and comorbid chronic pain-mood disorders.^\nBackground: Ketamine is increasingly being used in clinical settings in an off‐label fashion for treatment of major depression and chronic pain. Recent studies showing improvement in suicidal ideation has further increased the interest in its clinical use because when it works, it does so within hours, possibly reducing the risk of suicidal behavior. However, many issues need to be addressed before widespread clinical use can be recommended and definitive controlled trials can be designed. This includes the need for: a) a better developed conceptual framework for the mechanisms underlying Ketamine's antidepressant and nocioceptive properties; b) a clinical algorithm guiding appropriate selection of patients (e.g., first episode vs. treatment resistant depressed patients; presence of suicidal ideation; or patients with co‐occurring chronic pain); c) the identification of dosing strategies or adjunct agents that can extend the therapeutic effect; d) optimization of Ketamine administration protocols (i.e., intramuscular vs. intravenous route of administration and bolus vs. infusion, maximally effective dose, and consequences of concurrent benzodiazepines administration); e) larger placebo‐controlled studies demonstrating the effectiveness of Ketamine in the treatment of suicidal ideation; f) knowledge regarding the psychiatric medications that patients can be taking prior to receiving the treatment; and g) identification of predictive biomarkers and/or illness subtypes more likely to benefit from Ketamine treatment. Methods: Clinical cases of Ketamine administration for depression, suicidal ideation, and pain at the UT Health Science Center in San Antonio are being reviewed for this presentation. Clinical chart data and available rating scales will be summarized. When used for treatment of depression, Ketamine is largely administered as in the previously published depression trials (0.5 mg/kg) in 40‐ minute IV infusion. For the treatment of chronic pain and in few cases of depression, much higher doses of Ketamine (up to 2 mg/ kg) are administered as IV bolus along with concurrent benzodiazepines (most often midazolam). Ketamine administration is largely conducted in outpatient settings under direct physician supervision by an anesthesiologist with constant monitoring of vital signs (heart rate, blood pressure, respiratory rate, temperature, and oxygen saturation). Full psychiatric evaluations were conducted before the treatment and psychiatric follow was done within 1‐3 days after Ketamine administration. For most depressed patients, mood ratings were collected using the HAMD‐17, HAMD‐7, QIDS‐SR16 and Bipolar Inventory of Symptoms Scale (BISS). Assessment of pain severity was based on ratings severity from 0=No pain to 10=Extreme pain. Results: In agreement with published literature a single Ketamine infusion rapidly alleviated depressive symptomatology (response) in more than half of our patients. The treatment is well tolerated without major side effects. In some patients with comorbid pain, pain also decreased. Most patients first noticed improvement in mood the day after infusion. Although in a patient with severe MDD and residual suicidal ideation after a suicide attempt of high lethality, a sustained clinical response (including resolution of suicidality) was noted as soon as 120 minutes after the infusion began. In one case of severe post‐partum depression, a single bolus infusion of Ketamine (with concurrent use of midazolam) led to a sustained complete remission of symptoms (leading to patient discontinuing her SSRI) that was maintained for 2 months (date of last follow up). Conclusions: A growing body of clinical and research data suggest Ketamine may have clinical utility in some cases of depression and chronic pain. Clinical trials are required to identify the conditions that would maximize Ketamine acute effectiveness, possibly sustain its benefit and ensure the safety of long‐term, regular use."
"3315","0","Recent advances in the neuropsychopharmacology of serotonergic hallucinogens.^\nSerotonergic hallucinogens, such as (+)-lysergic acid diethylamide, psilocybin, and mescaline, are somewhat enigmatic substances. Although these drugs are derived from multiple chemical families, they all produce remarkably similar effects in animals and humans, and they show cross-tolerance. This article reviews the evidence demonstrating the serotonin 5-HT2A receptor is the primary site of hallucinogen action. The 5-HT2A receptor is responsible for mediating the effects of hallucinogens in human subjects, as well as in animal behavioral paradigms such as drug discrimination, head twitch response, prepulse inhibition of startle, exploratory behavior, and interval timing. Many recent clinical trials have yielded important new findings regarding the psychopharmacology of these substances. Furthermore, the use of modern imaging and electrophysiological techniques is beginning to help unravel how hallucinogens work in the brain. Evidence is also emerging that hallucinogens may possess therapeutic efficacy."

Computer-assisted personal interviews at baseline and 6-, 12-, and 18-month follow-ups included well-tested measures of substance use and dependence. Changes in substance dependence symptoms and drug use frequencies were calculated using Cohen's d statistic. Mean age was 22; 40% were female; 58% were Hispanic, 17% White, and 21% Black. At 18-month follow-up assessment, participants reported significantly fewer days of cocaine (d= - .85 at 18. months), ecstasy (d= - .93), benzodiazepine (d= - .82), and prescription opioid (d= - .81) use, as well as reduced substance dependence symptoms (d= - .42).

"3383","0","The Effects of Alcohol and Cannabis Use on the Cortical Thickness of Cognitive Control and Salience Brain Networks in Emerging Adulthood: A Co-twin Control Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Impairments in inhibitory control and its underlying brain networks (control/salience areas) are associated with substance misuse. Research often assumes a causal substance exposure effect on brain structure. This assumption remains largely untested, and other factors (e.g., familial risk) may confound exposure effects. We leveraged a genetically informative sample of twins aged 24 years and a quasi-experimental co-twin control design to separate alcohol or cannabis exposure effects during emerging adulthood from familial risk on control/salience network cortical thickness. METHODS: In a population-based sample of 436 twins aged 24 years, dimensional measures of alcohol and cannabis use (e.g., frequency, density, quantity, intoxications) across emerging adulthood were assessed. Cortical thickness of control/salience network areas were assessed using magnetic resonance imaging and defined by a fine-grained cortical atlas. RESULTS: Greater alcohol, but not cannabis, misuse was associated with reduced thickness of prefrontal (e.g., dorso/ventrolateral, right frontal operculum) and frontal medial cortices, as well as temporal lobe, intraparietal sulcus, insula, parietal operculum, precuneus, and parietal medial areas. Effects were predominately (pre)frontal and right lateralized. Co-twin control analyses suggested that the effects likely reflect both the familial predisposition to misuse alcohol and, specifically for lateral prefrontal, frontal/parietal medial, and right frontal operculum, an alcohol exposure effect. CONCLUSIONS: This study provides novel evidence that alcohol-related reductions in cortical thickness of control/salience brain networks likely represent the effects of alcohol exposure and premorbid characteristics of the genetic predisposition to misuse alcohol. The dual effects of these two alcohol-related causal influences have important and complementary implications regarding public health and prevention efforts to curb youth drinking."

"5053","1","The synergistic effect of dual use of amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine on drug-induced psychotic symptoms in Chinese synthetic drug users.^\nThe use of amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and ketamine is of particular clinical concern because of its associated psychotic symptoms. In Chinese clinical practice, ATS and ketamine are commonly used simultaneously, but very few studies have reported the symptom profile of users who use both drugs. This study determined whether the combined use of ATS and ketamine is associated with more psychotic symptoms than either ATS or ketamine alone. According to drug use characteristics, 375 Chinese synthetic drug users were categorized into 2 pairs of comparison groups: ATS-only (n=125) vs. ATS-mainly (ATS most of the time and ketamine sometimes, n=150) and ketamine-only (n=38) vs. ketamine-mainly (ketamine most of the time and ATS sometimes, n=62). We used the Chinese Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) to assess these patients' psychotic symptoms. ATS-mainly group had more anxiety/ depression and anergia symptoms than ATS-only group (p < 0.001), and ketaminemainly group had more thinking-disorder, activity and hostility-suspicion symptoms than ketamine-only group (p≤0.001). These findings indicate that ATS may exacerbate the thinking-disorders, activity and hostility-suspicion symptoms of ketamine users, and ketamine may exacerbate anxiety/depression and anergia symptoms of ATS users."
"7290","1","Characteristics and behaviors of ketamine users in France in 2003.^\nThe increase in recreational use of ketamine in France led to the carrying out of a survey aimed at depicting the sociological profiles of French ketamine users, their addictive behaviors, and the characteristics relevant to the use of the substance. This survey is based upon the analysis of 250 questionnaires, 24 semi-directive interviews, and two focus groups. Data was collected between July 2002 and June 2003 among individuals who had used ketamine at least once since January 1, 2001. The respondents were mostly males with a polydrug addiction, aged about 24, with little post-secondary education and no steady job. Ketamine was generally the last substance experimented with throughout their lifetime, as of the age of 22. The article reviews the frequency of ketamine use observed in the population surveyed, as well as the routes of administration, the quantities used, the circumstances of use, the sought-after effects and those experienced, and the risks perceived by the users themselves. The data collected provides working facts to allow for the development and implementation of policies for preventing the use and abuse of ketamine among vulnerable populations."
"8710","1","How to account for hallucinations in the interpretation of the antidepressant effects of psychedelics: a translational framework.^\nRATIONALE: Recent trials with psychedelics in major depressive disorder and treatment-resistant depression showed remarkable improvements in depressive symptoms that can last for up to several months after even a single administration. The lack of an appropriate placebo control group-as patients are often able to discriminate the subjective effects of the drug-and an incomplete understanding of the role of the hallucinogenic and mystical experience, hampers the interpretation of these therapeutic effects. OBJECTIVES: To control for these factors, we developed a translational framework based on establishing pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic (PK/PD) relationships in rodents and humans for hallucinogenic (i.e., discriminative stimulus effects in rodents and humans; head twitch responses in rodents; questionnaires in humans) and therapeutic effects. For the latter, we selected the pattern separation and attentional set-shifting tasks as measures for cognitive flexibility because of their high translational value. We predict that these PK/PD analyses will lead to a more objective evaluation of improvements in patients compared to relying only on the currently used self-reported questionnaires. We hypothesize that-if the role of the hallucinogenic experience is not central in the antidepressant effects of psychedelics-the ED(50)'s for the therapeutic effects will be significantly lower than for the hallucinogenic and mystical effects. CONCLUSION: Our framework will help to inform future studies that aim at the elucidation of the mechanism(s) of action of psychedelics in depression, and the role of the acute subjective and/or hallucinogenic experience in their effects."
"1108","1","Long-term effects of ""ecstasy"" use on serotonin transporters of the brain investigated by PET.^\nAlterations of the serotonergic system due to ecstasy consumption have been extensively documented in recent literature. However, reversibility of these neurotoxic effects still remains unclear. To address this question, PET was performed using the serotonin transporter (SERT) ligand 11C-(+)- McN5652 in a total of 117 subjects subdivided into 4 groups: actual ecstasy users (n = 30), former ecstasy users (n = 29), drug-naive control subjects (n = 29), and subjects with abuse of psychoactive agents other than ecstasy (n = 29). Methods: About 500 MBq 11C-(+)-McN5652 were injected intravenously. Thirty-five scans were acquired according to a dynamic scan protocol of 90 min using a full-ring whole-body PET system. Transaxial slices were reconstructed using an iterative method. Individual brains were transformed to a template defined earlier. Distribution volume ratios (DVRs) were derived by application of a reference tissue approach for reversible binding. Gray matter of the cerebellum served as reference. SERT-rich brain regions - mesencephalon, putamen, caudate, and thalamus - were selected for the evaluation of SERT availability using volumes of interest predefined in the template. Results: Compared with drug-naive control subjects, the DVR in actual ecstasy users was significantly reduced in the mesencephalon (P = 0.004) and the thalamus (P = 0.044). The DVR in former ecstasy users was very close to the DVR in drug-naive control subjects in all brain regions. The DVR in polydrug users was slightly higher than that in the drug-naive control subjects in all SERT-rich regions (not statistically significant). Conclusion: Our findings further support the hypothesis of ecstasy-induced protracted alterations of the SERT. In addition, they might indicate reversibility of the availability of SERT as measured by PET. However, this does not imply full reversibility of the neurotoxic effects."
"1313","0","A brief history of oxytocin and its role in modulating psychostimulant effects.^\nOver the past century, the polypeptide oxytocin has played an important role in medicine with major highlights including the identification of its involvement in parturition and the milk let-down reflex. Oxytocin is now implicated in an extensive range of psychological phenomena including reward and memory processes and has been investigated as a treatment for several psychiatric disorders including addiction, anxiety, autism, and schizophrenia. In this review, we first provide an historical overview of oxytocin and describe key aspects of its physiological activity. We then outline some pharmacological limitations in this field of research before highlighting the role of oxytocin in a wide range of behavioral and neuronal processes. Finally, we review evidence for a modulatory role of oxytocin with regard to psychostimulant effects. Key findings suggest that oxytocin attenuates a broad number of cocaine and methamphetamine induced behaviors and associated neuronal activity in rodents. Evidence also outlines a role for oxytocin in the prosocial effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, Ecstasy) in both rodents and humans. Clinical trials should now investigate the effectiveness of oxytocin as a novel intervention for psychostimulant addiction and should aim to determine its specific role in the therapeutic properties of MDMA that are currently being investigated."
"1940","0","Neurocognitive performance following acute mephedrone administration, with and without alcohol.^\nRecreational use of mephedrone, alone and in combination with alcohol, has increased over the past years. Pharmacological properties of mephedrone share similarities with methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), but its effect on neurocognitive function has not been well established in humans. The present study assessed the effect of mephedrone alone and after co-administration with alcohol on neurocognitive function. It was hypothesised that mephedrone would improve psychomotor performance but impair memory performance, when administered alone. Neurocognitive performance was expected to be impaired following mephedrone when combined with alcohol. Eleven participants received single doses of 200 mg mephedrone or placebo combined with 0.8 g/kg alcohol or placebo. Neurocognitive performance was assessed at baseline (T(0)), at one hour (T(1)) and four hours after (T(2)) mephedrone administration, by means of the Divided Attention Task (DAT), Critical Tracking Task (CTT), and the Spatial Memory Test (SMT). Mephedrone intoxication impaired short-term spatial memory at T(1) and improved critical tracking performance at T(2) Mephedrone alone did not affect divided attention, but did show an interaction with alcohol on reaction time at T(2) Reaction time decreased when mephedrone was combined with alcohol as compared to alcohol alone. Alcohol intoxication impaired both short- and long-term spatial memory at T(1) and divided attention at T(1) and T(2) Critical tracking performance was not affected by alcohol intoxication. The current findings support the hypothesis that mephedrone improves psychomotor performance, impairs spatial memory and does not affect divided attention performance. Stimulatory effects of mephedrone were not sufficient to compensate for the impairing effects of alcohol on most performance parameters."
"2167","1","Psilocybin therapy for treatment resistant depression: prediction of clinical outcome by natural language processing.^\nRATIONALE: Therapeutic administration of psychedelics has shown significant potential in historical accounts and recent clinical trials in the treatment of depression and other mood disorders. A recent randomized double-blind phase-IIb study demonstrated the safety and efficacy of COMP360, COMPASS Pathways' proprietary synthetic formulation of psilocybin, in participants with treatment-resistant depression. OBJECTIVE: While the phase-IIb results are promising, the treatment works for a portion of the population and early prediction of outcome is a key objective as it would allow early identification of those likely to require alternative treatment. METHODS: Transcripts were made from audio recordings of the psychological support session between participant and therapist 1 day post COMP360 administration. A zero-shot machine learning classifier based on the BART large language model was used to compute two-dimensional sentiment (valence and arousal) for the participant and therapist from the transcript. These scores, combined with the Emotional Breakthrough Index (EBI) and treatment arm were used to predict treatment outcome as measured by MADRS scores. (Code and data are available at https://github.com/compasspathways/Sentiment2D .) RESULTS: Two multinomial logistic regression models were fit to predict responder status at week 3 and through week 12. Cross-validation of these models resulted in 85% and 88% accuracy and AUC values of 88% and 85%. CONCLUSIONS: A machine learning algorithm using NLP and EBI accurately predicts long-term patient response, allowing rapid prognostication of personalized response to psilocybin treatment and insight into therapeutic model optimization. Further research is required to understand if language data from earlier stages in the therapeutic process hold similar predictive power."

McGirr et al. assessed ketamine adjunction in electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), which is frequently used in pharmacoresistant major depressive disorder. Because ketamine demonstrated good efficacy in depression, some studies assessed the potentiation of ECT by using ketamine as the anesthetic agent. In their meta-analysis, the authors included 5 randomized controlled trials comparing the antidepressive effects of ketamine + ECT (K + ECT) versus another anesthetic agent + ECT (AAA + ECT).9–12 No significant difference in remission or response rates, or in depressive symptoms was observed with or without ketamine adjunction in ECT. However, results from many studies argued for a possible ketamineinduced improvement of depressive symptoms during the very first week of treatment. Thus, a time-course of ketamine effects in ECT may provide relevant information in addition to the data supplied in the meta-analysis. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2017 APA, all rights reserved)"

Method: Data was collected from 1064 people who were living in NC using multiple stepped stratified random sampling method between April–May 2018. Socio-demographic information form, Model Europe Survey and Acculturation Attitudes Scale were used as study instruments. 2018 data were compared with 2003, 2008, 2013, 2015 and 2017 studies in which the same survey and method were used. Results: Five hundred and forty five participants were male and 519 female. Also, 33.6% of the participants were between the ages of 18–29, 58% of participants were born in Cyprus, 38.2% were university graduate or above and 48.2% of the participants were living with their spouses. According to the study, the prevalence of cigarette usage at least once in a lifetime was 64.9%, alcohol 74.5%, other psychoactive substance (OPS) 11.4% and illicit substance (IS) 9.0%. Being under 25 years of age, Turkey-born, not religious, using alcohol and cigarettes and experiencing drunkenness constituted the risk factors of IS users. Marginalization scores were lower both for drug users born in Turkey and NC. Discussion: It was observed that both OPS and IS usage have increased in the last 15 years. Cannabis, synthetic cannabinoid and ecstasy are more widely used. It was also observed that OPS is more used among those who cannot create a marginal response to acculturation stress. In prevention programs and treatments, sociocultural characteristics should be considered. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"
"3799","1","A comparison of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to non-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nRATIONALE: Novel, evidence-based treatments are required for treatment-resistant post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has beneficially augmented psychotherapy in several small clinical trials. OBJECTIVE: To review the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in treatment-resistant PTSD. METHODS: Systematic searches of four databases were conducted from inception to February 2020. A meta-analysis was performed on trials which were double-blinded, randomised, and compared MDMA-assisted psychotherapy to psychotherapy and placebo. The primary outcomes were the differences in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale (CAPS-IV) score and Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI). Secondary outcome measures included neurocognitive and physical adverse effects, at the time, and within 7 days of intervention. RESULTS: Four randomised controlled trials (RCTs) met inclusion criteria. When compared to active placebo, intervention groups taking 75 mg (MD -46.90; 95% (confidence intervals) CI -58.78, -35.02), 125 mg (MD -20.98; 95% CI -34.35, -7.61) but not 100 mg (MD -12.90; 95% CI -36.09, 10.29) of MDMA with psychotherapy, had significant decreases in CAPS-IV scores, as did the inactive placebo arm (MD -33.20; 95% CI -40.53, -25.87). A significant decrease in BDI when compared to active placebo (MD -10.80; 95% CI -20.39, -1.21) was only observed at 75 mg. Compared to placebo, participants reported significantly more episodes of low mood, nausea and jaw-clenching during sessions and lack of appetite after 7 days. CONCLUSION: These results demonstrate potential therapeutic benefit with minimal physical and neurocognitive risk for the use of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in TR-PTSD, despite little effect on Beck's Depression Inventory. Better powered RCTs are required to investigate further. INTERNATIONAL PROSPECTIVE REGISTER OF SYSTEMATIC REVIEWS: CRD42019109132 available online at www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero."

"2675","1","Effectiveness and safety of perioperative ketamine on postoperative pain after elective total hip arthroplasty under spinal anesthesia: preliminary results.^\nBackground and aims: Aim of this study is evaluate the effectiveness and safety of perioperative intravenous infusion of ketamine in patients scheduled for elective unilateral Total Hip Arthroplasty (THA) under spinal anesthesia. Methods: Midazolam 0.02 mg/kg was administered to all patients as premedication. Patients were randomly allocated in one of the following groups: Ketamine group and Control group. All patients received spinal anesthesia. Both groups received systemic i.v. analgesia with morphine 0.15 mg/kg plus ketoprophene 300 mg by elastomeric infusion pump at the rate of 2 ml/h for 24 h. The planned rescue analgesia was i.v. boluses of 2 mg of Morphine in order to obtain a VAS score ≤3. All patients received paracetamol every 6 h and, after systemic morphine discontinuation, oxycodone 5 mg SR 1 tablet every 12 h. In the Ketamine group a bolus of 0.15 mg/kg of ketamine was given to the patients before the start of operation then an infusion of 0.2 mg/kg/h was maintained until the end of the operation. In all patients the level of sedation and any appearance of unpleasant psychotomimetic manifestations were recorded using Ramsay Sedation Scale during the surgical procedure. Postoperative pain score was evaluated using VAS scale at rest and during mobilization at 2‐4‐8‐12‐24‐48‐72 h after surgery. Rescue morphine requirement as well as incidences of adverse events were recorded at the same postoperative intervals. The length of hospital stay (LOS) and patient satisfaction were investigated in both groups. Results: Seventeen eligible patients completed the study protocol from April to June 2011. A significant reduction in post‐operative pain score at rest and during patient mobilization, was observed in Ketamine group (P < 0.05), especially after 72 h (P < 0.01). No patients experienced psychotomimetic adverse effects (Ramsay Sedation Scale 2). Opioid requirement was significantly lower in the ketamine group than in the control group (P < 0.05). LOS was significantly shorter in Ketamine group (P < 0.01). Conclusions: Preliminary results showed that, in the multimodal analgesic regime, the perioperative administration of i.v. sub‐anesthetic doses of ketamine provides opioid‐sparing effects, improves the quality of postoperative analgesia and accelerates patient recovery after THA surgery."
"717","1","Effects of MDMA on sociability and neural response to social threat and social reward.^\nRATIONALE: +/-3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy"") reportedly produces unique subjective effects, including increased sociability, feelings of closeness with others, and reduced interpersonal defensiveness. Despite their apparent importance in recreational and potential psychotherapeutic use of MDMA, the defining characteristics and neurobiological mechanisms of these interpersonal effects are poorly understood. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We investigated acute effects of MDMA on self-reported sociability and neuronal activation in response to socially threatening (angry and fearful faces) and socially rewarding (happy faces) stimuli. Assessment of social threat response focused on amygdala activation, whereas assessment of social reward focused on ventral striatum activation. Healthy volunteers (N = 9) reporting past ecstasy use completed three experimental sessions, receiving MDMA (0.75 and 1.5 mg/kg) and placebo (PBO) under double-blind conditions. During peak drug effects, participants underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging while viewing standardized images depicting emotional facial expressions including angry, fearful, happy, and neutral expressions. They also completed standardized self-report measures of sociability. RESULTS: MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) increased self-reported sociability compared to MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) and PBO. MDMA (1.5 mg/kg) attenuated left amygdala response to angry facial expressions compared to PBO, but MDMA did not affect amygdala reactivity to fearful expressions. MDMA (0.75 mg/kg) enhanced ventral striatum response to happy expressions relative to PBO. CONCLUSIONS: These data present the first evidence that MDMA may increase sociability in humans both by diminishing responses to threatening stimuli and enhancing responses to rewarding social signals."
"6257","0","The Effect of a Four Week Intensified Pharmacological Treatment for Major Depressive Disorder Compared to Treatment as Usual in Subjects Who Had a First-time Treatment Failure on Their First-line Treatment.^\nRationale Over 28 million people suffer from current depressive disorder in the European Union. Major depressive disorder (MDD) is one of the most common psychiatric illnesses. The symptoms cause clinically significant distress or impairment in social, occupational, and other important areas of functioning. To treat MDD, there are several antidepressants available and prescribing medication is a process of trial‐and‐error. Guidelines do not explicitly advise on the order in which antidepressant medication should be prescribed. The choice of antidepressant should be tailored to the patient, while involving the patient in the decision‐making process. In general, the choice for the first‐ and second‐line treatment will be a second‐generation antidepressant. Recently, esketamine nasal spray (intranasal (IN) administration) was approved for patients with treatment‐resistant MDD (TRD). A patient is diagnosed with TRD when having used two antidepressants in sufficient duration and adequate dose without sufficient effect. TRD is associated with a negative impact on quality of life, higher risk for hospitalisations and suicide, comorbidities, poorer social and occupational functioning and a high carer burden. The efficacy of intranasal use of esketamine has been demonstrated in MDD subjects with treatment‐resistant symptoms but also in subjects with non‐treatment resistant depression, and is approved by the FDA and EMA as a third‐line treatment. Besides the registered esketamine nasal spray, which is not available in all countries to all patients because of the high costs, off‐label utilization of (es)ketamine infusions (IV) is growing extensively over time to treat TRD. Research conducted so far indicates an unequivocal initial substantial response to (es)ketamine IV in MDD populations, regardless of whether or not patients suffer from treatment resistant MDD. However, until now, there has not been a study investigating this in a sufficiently large population. This may be a unique opportunity to potentially prevent patients progressing into a treatment resistant illness stage. The potential implications of the results of the current study are the prevention of unnecessary trials of ineffective treatments, reducing subject burden substantially, as well as a reduction of healthcare and societal costs. Objective The primary objective is to compare the treatment response, expressed as mean change in symptom severity as measured through the Montgomery‐Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) under an early‐intensified pharmacological treatment to that under treatment as usual, in subjects who had a first‐time treatment failure on their first‐line treatment. Main trial endpoints Change in symptom severity total score from baseline (visit 2) to end of treatment (visit 4). This is measured using MADRS. Secondary trial endpoints 1. Comparison of the proportion of participants (EIPT vs. TAU) that is in symptomatic remission at visit 4. Remission is defined as a MADRS score ≤ 12. 2. To compare changes in the severity and improvement sub‐scores of the Clinical Global Impression Scale (CGI 1) between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 3. To compare changes in the levels of depression and anxiety as assessed with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS 2) between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 4. To compare changes in cognitive performance as measured through the Trail Making Test 3, Digit Symbol Substitution Test 4, Rey Auditory Verbal Learning Test 5 as well as the Perceived Deficits Questionnaire 6 between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 5. To compare changes in quality of life and functioning measures (Q‐LES‐Q‐SF 7, LAPS 8, QLS‐100 9 and SDS 10 between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 6. To compare presence of side effects as measured thro gh General Assessment of Side Effects Scale (GASE) and reported spontaneously between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 7. To compare use of concomitant medication between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). 8. To compare premature discontinuation (timing and reason) between the two treatment arms (EIPT/TAU) over the six week treatment period (visit 2 versus visit 4). Trial design The clinical study is an international, multicenter controlled, randomised, open label trial (with blinded raters), with a treatment duration of four weeks. Trial population The aim is to recruit 418 subjects with major depressive disorder, without psychotic features. Male and female subjects, in‐ and out‐patients, within the age range of 18 to 70 years old are eligible for participation. The main exclusion criteria are defined to protect the wellbeing of subjects, e.g. being pregnant or breastfeeding, subjects with previous failure on (es)ketamine, meeting any contraindications, or participants with a known intolerance to (es)ketamine. Interventions Subjects are randomised to treatment as usual (second‐line treatment) or to the early‐intensified pharmacological treatment (third‐line treatment). Treatment per can be found in the table below: Table 1. Overview of treatment randomisation per study sample. MDD sample Treatment as Usual (TAU) Switch to second‐line antidepressant Early‐Intensified Pharmacological Treatment (EIPT) Oral antidepressant plus esketamine nasal spray or esketamine IV or ketamine IV Ethical considerations relating to the clinical trial including the expected benefit to the individual subject or group of subjects represented by the trial subjects as well as the nature and extent of burden and risks In the current study, clinical practice is mimicked as much as possible to maximize generalizability and for feasibility purposes. To this end, Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) are followed with regards to contraindications (implemented as exclusion criterion), safety measures and allowed combinations with other medications. Site visits and assessments are kept to a minimum to keep subject burden at an acceptable level, while meeting the objectives of the study. Blood samples for biomarker analyses are only collected when subjects provide consent; safety measures are performed as part of clinical routine. Use of both EIPT and TAU medications implies that there is a risk of side effects. For TAU, these side effects are well‐known, and would be no different from regular clinical practice. For EIPT, there are acute psychotropic effects of (es)ketamine which are considered side effects for this study, such as anxiety, delusional thoughts, dissociation and hallucinations (see IMPDs). In addition, increased blood pressure and heart rate, as well as dizziness and nausea are reported. These acute effect are transient and after 2 hours completely dissipated. Therefore, an observation period of 2 hours after every administration is implemented to monitor this closely. The potential side effects of all treatments are well‐known and will be monitored during the study with a standardized side‐effect scale (GASE), spontaneous reporting and the local standard procedure regarding other measures such as laboratory tests, physical examinations, ECGs. The results will be captured (as data) and reviewed for tolerability. Most of the tests that will be done as part of standard clinical care (lab tests, ECG, physical examination) for EIPT are also part of TAU. A benefit of the study is that while ensuring that the tolerability and additional burden remains acceptable, we expect that the larger effect in reducing symptom severity will justify the increase in burden relative to the TAU group. When participants are treated with the intense treatment in earlier stage of the illness (less trial and error before moving on to this treatment option), this is expected to result in a reduced burden of disease for subjects, expressed as less relapses, lower all‐cause mortality, hospitalisations and job losses and improved quality of life, in addition to lower societal and healthcare costs as well as preventing patients from turning into a treatment‐resistant treatment phase. Last, an advantage of participation could be that subjects will be more thoroughly followed and examined, and that therefore effects and side effects are measured and managed better. Rationale Schizophrenia (SZ) affects approximately 4.5 million people across the European Union (EU) and is associated with annual healthcare and societal costs of 29 billion Euros. The impact on the daily life of patients is huge, ranging from frequent relapses and hospitalisations, the inability to maintain a job or continue schooling, to a low quality of life, impaired cognitive functioning, suicidal ideation and an increase morbidity rate, next to the large burden for carers. When diagnosed with schizophrenia or related disorder, patients are commonly prescribed antipsychotics. One‐third of the schizophrenia patients are regarded treatment‐resistant (TR), meaning that at least two antipsychotic trials have failed. Typically, clozapine is prescribed for TR patients, which is effective for approximately 40% of patients. Clozapine is among the most effective treatments, with the lowest all‐cause mortality. Although it is among the most effective antipsychotics, it is generally not used earlier in the illness course due to a small risk of severe neutropenia/agranulocytosis, which is why patients treated with clozapine are intensely monitored. However, this small risk outweighs the burden of not receiving an effective treatment. Since clozapine is among the most effective treatments, this leads to the research question whether earlier initiation of third‐line treatment ('early intensified' pharmacological treatment; EIPT) would be more beneficial than the current second‐line treatments (treatment as usual; TAU). If this is indeed the case, this could lead to the prevention of unnecessary trials of ineffective treatments, hospitalisations, and recommendations for adaptations of worldwide guidelines as well as a reduction of healthcare and societal costs The INTENSIFY‐Schizophrenia trial is part of the larger Horizon 2021 project Psych‐STRATA, with the central goal of paving the way for a shift towards a treatment decision‐making process tailored for the individual at risk for treatment resistance. To that end, the investigators aim to establish evidence‐based criteria to make decisions of early intense treatment in individuals at risk for treatment resistance across the major psychiatric disorders of schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and major depression. The current protocol focuses on the sample of schizophrenia patients. Objective The primary objective is to compare the treatment response, expressed as mean change in symptom severity as measured through the Positive And Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS) under an early‐intensified pharmacological treatment to that under treatment as usual, in subjects who had a first‐time treatment failure on their first‐line treatment for schizophrenia, schizoaffective or schizophreniform disorder. Main trial endpoints Mean change in symptom severity total score from baseline (visit 2) to end of treatment (visit 4) between the two treatment arms (EIPT vs. TAU). This is measured using PANSS. Secondary trial objectives Comparison of the proportion of participants (EIPT vs. TAU) that is in symptomatic remission at visit 4. Remission is defined as meeting the PANSS modified Andreasen criteria (Low scores (≤3) P1. Delusions; P3. Hallucinatory behavior; P2. Conceptual disorganization; N1. Blunted affect; N4. Passive/apathetic social withdrawal; N6. Lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation; G5. Mannerisms/posturing; G9. Unusual thought content.

Trial design The clinical study is an international, multicenter controlled, randomised, open label trial (with blinded raters), with a treatment duration of six weeks. Trial population The aim is to recruit 418 subjects with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder or schizophreniform disorder. Male and female subjects, in‐ and out‐patients, within the age range of 18 to 70 years old are eligible for participation. The main exclusion criteria are defined to protect the wellbeing of subjects, e.g. being pregnant or breastfeeding, subjects with previous failure on clozapine, meeting any contraindications, or participants with a known intolerance to clozapine. Interventions Subjects are randomised to treatment as usual (second‐line treatment) or to the early‐intensified pharmacological treatment (third‐line treatment; clozapine). Ethical considerations relating to the clinical trial including the expected benefit to the individual subject or group of subjects represented by the trial subjects as well as the nature and extent of burden and risks All medications studied in the current trial are widely used (alone or in combination) in clinical practice and side effect profiles are well established. In the current study, clinical practice is mimicked as much as possible to maximize generalizability and for feasibility purposes. To this end, Summaries of Product Characteristics (SmPCs) are followed with regards to contraindications (implemented as exclusion criterion), safety measures and prohibited comedications. Site visits and assessments are kept to a minimum to keep subject burden at an acceptable level, while meeting the objectives of the study. Blood samples for biomarker analyses are only collected when subjects provide consent; safety measures are performed as part of clinical routine. Overall, the risks are similar to daily clinical practice; the only difference relative to clinical practice is the application of early‐intensified pharmacological treatment earlier in the illness. Still, these intense treatment options are also commonly prescribed by clinicians. There are no indications in existing literature or clinical practice that the earlier introduction of these medications poses a safety risk when used in an earlier illness phase than indicated in the SmPC. A benefit of the study is that if it indeed turns out that the clozapine is associated with more symptom improvement compared to treatment as usual, future patients have to go through less trial and error, which results in a reduced burden (higher quality of life, less unemployment, less hospital sations) for patients and carers as well as lower societal and healthcare costs. IMPORTANT: the study was submitted to the European authorities before (see NCT05603104) and they requested to split this study into 3 studies (1 for each diagnostic category). We have done this and created 3 new ClinicalTrials.gov studies as well, from which this is one for major depressive disorder. Once we have received the NCT numbers for SZ and BD, we will add them here. The site in the UK (London) followed the advice and will submit 3 separate protocols and are therefore included in the current record. However, Israel already submitted this as one protocol. Therefore, we keep the old clinicaltrials.gov number for Israel (NCT05603104)."
"3673","1","Systematized Review of Psychotherapeutic Components of Psilocybin-Assisted Psychotherapy.^\nObjective: This systematized review sought to fill a gap in psilocybin research by investigating the structure and format of psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), with a focus on the counseling components of the treatment. Methods: A systematized review of PAP was conducted by using the PubMed and PsycInfo databases to search for peer-reviewed studies of human clinical trials, published within the past 25 years, in which psilocybin was administered with psychological support in a clinical setting. Results: Eleven articles matched the criteria necessary for inclusion in this review. PAP was found to consist of three stages: pretreatment sessions to prepare participants for psilocybin, treatment sessions in which psilocybin was administered, and posttreatment sessions to integrate the experience with daily life. Conventional psychotherapy was primarily seen in the pre- and posttreatment sessions. Psychotherapies included in PAP differed among studies, but most often included music therapy and a nondirective supportive approach to treatment. Conclusions: This systematized review found important commonalities among clinical trials of PAP published within the past 25 years and revealed key differences among studies in psychotherapy's incorporation into PAP. Additional research is needed to identify the unique effect of psychotherapy in PAP."
"5048","1","Repeated intravenous infusions of ketamine: Neurocognition in patients with anxious and nonanxious treatment-resistant depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent studies have suggested that neurocognition is changed after repeated infusions of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). The objective of this study was to investigate whether differences existed in the neurocognitive effect of six ketamine infusions in patients with anxious and nonanxious TRD and to determine the association between baseline neurocognition and changes in symptoms after the infusions. METHOD: Patients with anxious (n = 30) and nonanxious TRD (n = 20) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days. Speed of processing (SOP), working memory (WM), verbal learning and memory (VBM), visual learning and memory (VSM) and the severity of depressive and anxious symptoms were assessed at baseline, one day after the last infusion (day 13) and two weeks after the completion of the serial infusions (day 26). A linear mixed model was used to determine whether the neurocognitive changes differed between the two groups. Pearson correlation analysis was used to determine the relationship between baseline neurocognition and the changes in the symptomatic scores. RESULTS: Patients with anxious TRD had significant increases in SOP on day 13 and day 26 (both p < 0.001), and in VBM on day 13 (p = 0.028). However, no significant increase in any neurocognitive domain was found in patients with nonanxious TRD. Faster SOP at baseline was associated with greater improvement of anxious symptoms in patients with anxious TRD, and better VSM at baseline was associated with greater improvement of depressive symptoms in patients with nonanxious TRD. LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: After six ketamine infusions, neurocognitive improvement was observed in patients with anxious TRD but not in patients with nonanxious TRD."
"8910","1","Opposite effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on sensorimotor gating in rats versus healthy humans.^\nRATIONALE: Prepulse inhibition of acoustic startle refers to the reduction in the startle response when the startling stimulus is preceded by a weak prepulse stimulus. This phenomenon provides an operational measure of sensorimotor gating that has been found to be reduced in patients with schizophrenia and rats treated with serotonin agonists or serotonin releasers. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we compared the effects of a serotonin releaser, MDMA, on prepulse inhibition in laboratory rats and healthy human volunteers. In particular, we investigated whether MDMA disrupts PPI in humans as observed in animal studies. METHODS: Rats were tested after placebo and MDMA in a counterbalanced order at an interval of 1 week, with separate groups of rats being used for each dose of MDMA (1.7, 5.4 and 17.0 mg/kg). On each test day, rats were first tested after no injections and retested 2 h later, 10 min after a subcutaneous injection of placebo or MDMA. For the human study, a placebo-controlled within-subject design and double-blind procedures were used. Subjects were examined twice at a 2 to 4 week interval after either placebo or drug administration (order being counterbalanced). On each test day, subjects underwent baseline testing including psychological and PPI measures. Ninety minutes later, subjects received placebo or MDMA (1.7 mg/kg PO) and were retested after 75 min during the peak of behavioral effects of MDMA. RESULTS: As expected, MDMA decreased prepulse inhibition in a dose-related fashion in rats. In contrast, a typical recreational dose of MDMA (1.7 mg/kg, orally) increased prepulse inhibition in subjects experiencing robust psychological effects. CONCLUSIONS: This surprising disparity between the effects of the drug in rats and humans may reflect a species-specific difference in the mechanism of action of MDMA or in the behavioral expression of a similar pharmacological effect, or both."
"3451","1","Neurocognitive performance under combined regimens of ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-fentanyl in healthy adults: A randomised trial.^\nAnalgesic doses of ketamine affects neurocognition; however, deficits under co-administration regimens are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of ketamine, alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or fentanyl on neurocognition. Using a randomised, within-subjects gender stratified design, 39 participants (mean age = 28.4, SD ± 5.8) received a ketamine bolus of 0.3 mg/kg followed by 0.15 mg/kg/h infusion of ketamine (3 h duration). At 1.5 h post-ketamine infusion commencement, participants received either: i) 0.7 μg/kg/h infusion of dexmedetomidine (n = 19) (KET/DEX) or (ii) three 25 μg fentanyl injections over 1.5 h (n = 20) (KET/FENT). Reaction and Movement time (RTI, Simple and 5Choice), Visuospatial Working Memory (SWM) and Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Whole blood drug concentrations were determined during ketamine-only infusion, at co-administration (KET/DEX or KET/FENT) and at 2-h post-treatment. Ketamine-only administration impaired psychomotor response speed (Simple and 5Choice) and impaired memory (all p < .001), however did not alter executive function abilities. Independent of sedation, co-administration of dexmedetomidine produced synergistic performance and memory deficits which persisted at post-treatment (KET/DEX) (all p < .001), and were comparatively greater than for KET/FENT (all p < .05). Ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine concentrations were modestly associated with reduced psychomotor speed and accuracy (all p < .05), and an inverse relationship was found between blood concentrations of ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine and performance on memory tasks. Co-administration of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not with fentanyl exerts synergistic effects on psychomotor performance and memory without executive dysfunction. Assessment of these effects in clinical groups is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)"
"7417","0","Effect of acute brain tyrosine depletion on MDMA-induced changes in brain 5-HT.^\nThe mechanism by which 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, serotonin) neurotoxicity has been suggested to involve an acute release of tyrosine and its non-enzymatic conversion to dopamine. To determine whether brain tyrosine availability is important in MDMA-induced neurotoxicity, brain tyrosine was acutely depleted with a tyrosine-free amino acid mixture (1 g/kg intraperitoneal; twice 1 h apart) which was administered prior to an injection of MDMA (12.5 mg/kg intraperitoneal). A small increase in both the hippocampal and striatal tyrosine concentration occurred in control rats treated with MDMA. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture significantly decreased tyrosine levels by more than 50% in both brain regions 2 h after injection of either MDMA or saline. MDMA significantly reduced brain 5-HT content 2 h later, but this was of a similar magnitude in control and tyrosine-depleted groups. The long-term neurotoxic 5-HT loss in the hippocampus induced two weeks after MDMA administration was unaltered by the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture. Striatal dopamine content was unaffected by acute MDMA in all groups, while the tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given with MDMA significantly decreased striatal dopamine content 2 weeks later. The tyrosine-free amino acid mixture given alone had no affect on rectal body temperature but attenuated the duration of MDMA-induced hyperthermia. The results confirmed the ability of systemic MDMA to acutely increase brain tyrosine content, but also indicated that a marked acute reduction of brain tyrosine does not directly affect either immediate 5-HT release (as measured by tissue depletion) or long-term hippocampal serotonergic neurotoxicity produced by MDMA."
"9014","0","Sodium nitroprusside treatment for psychotic symptoms and cognitive deficits of schizophrenia: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.^\nSchizophrenia presents with a broad range of negative, positive, and cognitive symptoms, and comprehensive treatment is still a challenge. Sodium nitroprusside (SNP) has been reported to rapidly reduce psychotic symptoms and improve cognitive functions in patients with schizophrenia, providing a new possible direction for treatment. In this study, we tested whether SNP can improve psychotic symptoms and cognitive function in schizophrenia patients with longer disease history. This was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial conducted between May 2016 and April 2017. Forty-two schizophrenia patients aged 18-45 years were recruited from Henan Province Mental Hospital. Baseline psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and baseline cognitive functions were measured using the Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale. Patients received two SNP or placebo infusions (0.5 mu g/kg per min for 4 h) at a one-week interval. We reassessed psychiatric symptoms and cognitive functions using the same tests shortly after the first and second infusions and 4 weeks after the second infusion. We did not find any significant effect of SNP over placebo on psychotic symptoms or cognitive functions, although SNP was relatively well tolerated with a good safety profile."
"1953","1","Bidirectional relations between MDMA and social context: crosstalk between drug response and social interaction.^\nMany drugs of abuse are used in social settings, i.e., in the presence of others. Yet, little is known about the effects of drugs in social contexts, including how they affect social interactions, or conversely, how social conditions affect responses to drugs. Ecstasy, or methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), in particular, is known for its prosocial effects, and it is typically used in groups. MDMA is thought to facilitate feelings of social connectedness. However, most controlled studies of the psychopharmacology of this and other abused drugs is that the effects of drugs are typically studied in a socially isolated setting, rather than in a social context. Thus, the full spectrum of drug effects may not be detected. To address this gap, we have conducted controlled, double blind laboratory studies to examine the effects of MDMA on measures of social function, including the ability to detect emotions in others, reactivity to positive and negative social images, and sensitivity to social rejection. We have also studied the effects of social context on responses to the drug, by testing participants in the presence of other subjects, including those who did or did not also receive the drug. Taken together, we have established that MDMA dampens reactivity to negative emotional expressions in others, that it reduces feelings of social rejection, and that its effects are enhanced in the presence of others. This line of research will help to understand the basis of recreational use of MDMA, as well as its potential therapeutic use."
"5047","1","Baseline insomnia as a predictor of antidepressant efficacy to repeated intravenous ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression: A preliminary study.^\nOBJECTIVE: Ketamine has been demonstrated to have robust and rapid antidepressant effects, and few studies have focused on the relationship between insomnia and the efficacy of ketamine. The objective of this study was to examine whether baseline insomnia predicted the antidepressant efficacy of repeated intravenous ketamine infusions for unipolar and bipolar depression. METHOD: Patients with high insomnia (n = 64) or low insomnia (n = 68) received six intravenous infusions of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min) over 12 days (Monday-Wednesday-Friday). The Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) without sleep item was used to assess depressive symptoms. Response was defined as a MADRS total score ≥ 50%, and remission was defined as a MADRS total score ≤ 10. RESULT: There were no differences in response or remission rates between patients with high and low insomnia. However, the logistic regression model showed that high insomnia predicted an increased likelihood of response and remission. Cox proportional hazards models showed a reduced latency to respond and remit in patients with high insomnia. A linear mixed model showed that the high insomnia subgroup had greater improvement than the low insomnia subgroup (all p < 0.05). LIMITATION: The major limitation of this study is the open-label design. CONCLUSION: When given six ketamine infusions, patients with high insomnia were more likely to respond and remit than those with low insomnia. Patients with high insomnia showed not only a shorter latency to respond and remit, but also greater improvement than those with low insomnia."
"6470","1","Distinct trajectories of antidepressant response to intravenous ketamine.^\nBACKGROUND: The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist ketamine is potentially effective in treatment resistant depression. However, its antidepressant efficacy is highly variable, and there is little information about predictors of response. METHODS: We employed growth mixture modeling (GMM) analysis to examine specific response trajectories to intravenous (IV) ketamine (three infusions; mean dose 0.63 mg/kg, SD 0.28, range 0.30 - 2.98 mg/kg over 40 min) in 328 depressed adult outpatients referred to a community clinic. The Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology-Self-Report (QIDS-SR) assessed depression severity at baseline and before each infusion, up to three infusions for four total observations. RESULTS: GMM revealed three QIDS-SR response trajectories. There were two groups of severely depressed patients, with contrasting responses to ketamine. One group (n=135, baseline QIDS-SR=18.8) had a robust antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=7.3); the other group (n=97, QIDS-SR=19.8) was less responsive (final QIDS-SR=15.6). A third group (n=96) was less severely depressed at baseline (QIDS-SR=11.7), with intermediate antidepressant response (final QIDS-SR=6.6). Comparisons of demographic and clinical characteristics between groups with severe baseline depression revealed higher childhood physical abuse in the group with robust ketamine response (p=0.01). LIMITATIONS: This was a retrospective analysis on a naturalistic sample. Patients were unblinded and more heterogenous than those included in most controlled clinical trial samples. Information pertaining to traumatic events occurring after childhood and pre-existing or concurrent medical conditions that may have affected outcomes was not available. CONCLUSIONS: Overall, ketamine's effect in patients with severe baseline depression and history of childhood maltreatment may be consistent with ketamine-induced blockade of behavioral sensitization."
"7488","1","Ayahuasca, a potentially rapid acting antidepressant: focus on safety and tolerability.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a psychedelic brew originally used by Amazonian indigenous groups and in religious rituals. Pre-clinical and observational studies have demonstrated its possible potential as an antidepressant, and open- and placebo-controlled clinical trials corroborated these results. For it to become an approved treatment for depression, its safety and tolerability need to be assessed and documented. AREAS COVERED: We have gathered data regarding the occurrence of adverse events (AEs) in all reported randomized, placebo-controlled trials with healthy and clinical populations involving ayahuasca administration (n = 108 ayahuasca administrations). We systematically categorized these results, recorded their prevalence, and discussed the possible mechanisms related to their emergence. EXPERT OPINION: There were no reports of serious AEs, indicating a relative safety of ayahuasca administration in controlled settings. Most common AEs included nausea, vomiting, headaches, and transient increases in cardiovascular measurements. Ayahuasca research is still in its infancy, especially concerning the absence of large and robust clinical trials to verify its antidepressant effects. Dose standardization, legal prohibition of the possession of its alkaloids and how traditional communities will be compensated if ayahuasca becomes an approved medicine are the biggest obstacles to overcome for its future use in the therapeutic context."
"4357","1","Plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA or intranasal oxytocin in humans.^\nMDMA (±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, 'ecstasy') is reportedly used recreationally because it increases feelings of sociability and interpersonal closeness. Prior work suggests that the pro-social effects of MDMA may be mediated by release of oxytocin. A direct examination of plasma levels of oxytocin after acute doses of oxytocin and MDMA, in the same individuals, would provide further evidence for the idea that MDMA produces its pro-social effects by increasing oxytocin. Fourteen healthy MDMA users participated in a 4-session, double-blind study in which they received oral MDMA (0.75 and 1.5mg/kg), intranasal oxytocin (20IU or 40IU), and placebo. Plasma oxytocin concentrations, as well as cardiovascular and subjective effects were assessed before and at several time points after drug administration. MDMA (1.5mg/kg only) increased plasma oxytocin levels to a mean peak of 83.7pg/ml at approximately 90-120min, compared to 18.6pg/ml after placebo. Intranasal oxytocin (40IU, but not 20IU) increased plasma oxytocin levels to 48.0pg/ml, 30-60min after nasal spray administration. MDMA dose-dependently increased heart rate, blood pressure, feelings of euphoria (e.g., 'High' and 'Like Drug'), and feelings of sociability, whereas oxytocin had no cardiovascular or subjective effects. The subjective and cardiovascular responses to MDMA were not related to plasma oxytocin levels, although the N was small for this analysis. Future studies examining the effects of oxytocin antagonists on responses to MDMA will help to determine the mechanism by which MDMA produces pro-social effects."
"3238","1","19.3 Psilocybin-Assisted Therapy for MDD: current Evidence and Clinical Considerations.^\nObjectives: Psilocybin‐assisted therapy is currently being investigated for its therapeutic potential in the treatment of MDD in adults. This talk will review the typical therapeutic approach, along with some of the major findings in this area to date, with a focus on the results from a prospective long‐term follow‐up study of patients with moderate to severe depression who received 2 doses of psilocybin in a supported setting. Methods: This randomized, waiting‐list controlled study enrolled 27 patients aged 21 to 75 years with moderate to severe unipolar depression (GRID‐HAMD ≥17). Participants were randomized to an immediate or delayed (8 weeks) treatment condition in which they received 2 doses of psilocybin with supportive psychotherapy. Twenty‐four participants completed both psilocybin sessions and were followed through 12 months following their second dose. Results: All 24 participants attended all follow‐up visits through the 12‐month timepoint. Large decreases from baseline in GRID Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (GRID‐HAMD) scores were observed at 1‐, 3‐, 6‐, and 12‐month follow‐up (Cohen d = 2.3, 2.0, 2.6, and 2.4, respectively). Treatment response (≥50% reduction in GRID‐HAMD score from baseline) and remission were 75% and 58%, respectively, at 12 months. There were no serious adverse events judged to be related to psilocybin in the long‐term follow‐up period, and no participants reported psilocybin use outside of the context of the study. Participant ratings of personal meaning, spiritual experience, and mystical experience after the sessions predicted increased well‐being at 12 months but did not predict improvement in depression. One‐third of the participants began treatment with an antidepressant medication during the follow‐up period. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate that the substantial antidepressant effects of psilocybin‐assisted therapy may be durable at least through 12 months following acute intervention in some patients. Contextual factors and psychotherapy likely play a substantial role in the safety and efficacy of the treatment and will require careful consideration if this intervention is studied in younger patient populations.

"8240","1","MDMA-assisted psychotherapy; Inclusion of transgender and gender diverse people in the frontiers of PTSD treatment trials.^\nINTRODUCTION: Transgender and gender diverse (TGD) people experience stigma, discrimination, trauma, and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) at higher rates compared to the general population; however, TGD people have been underrepresented in PTSD research. Clinical trials of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy demonstrate promising safety and efficacy for the treatment of PTSD. Issues related to equitable access, power imbalances in the therapeutic relationship, and vulnerable states of consciousness occasioned by MDMA are magnified when working with people affected by structural vulnerabilities and health disparities, and community engagement in research planning and implementation is essential. To inform the inclusion and safety of TGD people in future MDMA-assisted psychotherapy research, the aims of the current study were to: characterize TGD experiences with trauma-related mental health care, assess openness of TGD people to participate in experimental PTSD research, and to gather specific feedback on protocol design for conducting MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with TGD people. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We conducted three virtual focus group discussions (FGDs) with 5-6 participants each (N = 17). Eligible TGD participants had a history of receiving trauma-related mental health care. Each FGD was facilitated by two licensed clinicians who identified as TGD. Qualitative data analysis was conducted via an iterative process of identification of recurrent patterns and themes. RESULTS: We have identified several key issues TGD people face when seeking and engaging in trauma-related mental health care, including barriers to receiving adequate gender-affirming and trauma-informed mental health care and frustration with providers lacking cultural humility. Suggested amendments to MDMA-assisted psychotherapy protocols include: routine collection of trans-inclusive gender identity data, implementing an explicit gender-affirming treatment approach, ensuring a culturally safe setting, and diversifying co-therapy dyads. DISCUSSION: The inclusion of TGD voices in early conversations about emerging experimental PTSD interventions promotes equitable access, in the context of health and healthcare disparities, and helps researchers understand the needs of the community and tailor research to meet those needs. Through an ongoing conversation with the TGD community, we aim to incorporate a gender-affirming approach into existing research protocols and inform future applications of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy in addressing the effects of minority stress and boosting resilience."

"2134","0","A Critical Evaluation of Reports Associating Ayahuasca with Life-Threatening Adverse Reactions.^\nAyahuasca is a botanical hallucinogenic preparation traditionally consumed by Northwestern Amazonian indigenous groups. Scientific evidence suggests good tolerability after acute administration of ayahuasca and also after years or even decades of its ritual consumption. Nevertheless, some scientific and media reports associate ayahuasca or some of its alkaloids with severe intoxications. The purpose of the present text is to do a critical evaluation of these reports. The evaluation of the cases highlights the fact that some lack accurate forensic/toxicological information, while others are not directly relevant to traditional ayahuasca preparations. These limitations reduce the possibility of an accurate risk assessment, which could indicate potential contraindications and susceptibilities for ayahuasca consumption. Nevertheless, even with these limitations, the cases suggest that previous cardiac and hepatic pathologies and current use of serotonergic drugs/medications are contraindications to ayahuasca use, and that caution should be taken when using different botanical species and extracted/synthetic alkaloids to prepare ayahuasca analogues. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC."
"7338","1","Psilocybin-induced changes in cerebral blood flow are associated with acute and baseline inter-individual differences.^\nResearch into the use of psilocybin for the treatment of psychiatric disorders is a growing field. Nevertheless, robust brain-behavior relationships linking psilocybin-induced brain changes to subjective drug-induced effects have not been established. Furthermore, it is unclear if the acute neural effects are dependent on individual heterogeneity in baseline characteristics. To address this, we assessed the effects of three oral doses of psilocybin vs. placebo on cerebral blood flow (CBF) using arterial spin labeling in healthy participants (N = 70; n = 31, 0.16 mg/kg; n = 10, 0.2 mg/kg; n = 29, 0.215 mg/kg). First, we quantified psilocybin-induced changes in relative and absolute CBF. Second, in an exploratory analysis, we assessed whether individual baseline characteristics and subjective psychedelic experience are associated with changes in CBF. Psychological and neurobiological baseline characteristics correlated with the psilocybin-induced reduction in relative CBF and the psilocybin-induced subjective experience. Furthermore, the psilocybin-induced subjective experience was associated with acute changes in relative and absolute CBF. The results demonstrated that inter-individual heterogeneity in the neural response to psilocybin is associated with baseline characteristics and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the psychedelic-induced altered state. Overall, these findings help guide the search for biomarkers, paving the way for a personalized medicine approach within the framework of psychedelic-assisted therapy."
"496","1","Efficacy and safety of ketamine in patients with complex regional pain syndrome: A systematic review.^\nDespite being a recognized clinical entity for over 140 years, complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS) remains a difficult-to-treat condition. While there have been multiple therapies explored in the treatment of CRPS, NMDA antagonists such as ketamine continue to hold significant interest because of their potential ability to alter the central sensitization noted in chronic pain states. The objective of this review is to identify published literature for evidence of the efficacy and safety of ketamine in the treatment of CRPS. PubMed and the Cochrane Controlled Trials Register were searched (final search 26 May 2011) using the MeSH terms ‘ketamine’, ‘complex regional pain syndrome’, ‘analgesia’ and ‘pain’ in the English literature. The manuscript bibliographies were then reviewed to identify additional relevant papers. Observational trials were evaluated using the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality criteria; randomized trials were evaluated using the methodological assessment of randomized clinical trials. The search methodology yielded three randomized, placebo-controlled trials, seven observational studies and nine case studies/reports. In aggregate, the data available reveal ketamine as a promising treatment for CRPS. The optimum dose, route and timing of administration remain to be determined. Randomized controlled trials are needed to establish the efficacy and safety of ketamine and to determine its long-term benefit in CRPS. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)"

"7263","1","Ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy for depressive disorder: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is one of the most effective treatments for depressive disorder. Sub-anesthetic dose of ketamine exerts a rapid and robust antidepressive effect. However, it is still unclear whether ketamine usage in ECT is efficacious as an antidepressant. We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis on the effects of ketamine in ECT among patients with depressive disorder. MEDLINE, EMBASE, the CENTRAL and PsycINFO for randomized controlled trials were searched to assess the effects of ketamine used in ECT until 31 Mar 2018 (PROSPERO: CRD42018081024). Sixteen studies including 928 patients were enrolled. At the end of ECT, no significant standardized mean difference (SMD) was observed in favor of the ketamine group. Depressive scores were lower in the ketamine group after 1st ECT and 3rd to 6th ECTs. The depressive scores were lower after 2nd, 3rd, 4th and 6th ECTs when the ketamine was used as an add-on anesthetic, while the depressive scores were lower after 1st ECT when ketamine alone was used. Ketamine in ECT showed no better response and remission rate, while increased adverse events, especially related to cardiovascular and psychiatric systems, during the whole ECT course. In conclusion, although ketamine used in ECT cannot reduce the depressive symptoms at the end of treatment, it could accelerate the antidepressive effect in depressive patients receiving ECT, especially in those who used ketamine as an add-on anesthetic. However, ketamine cautiously needs to be administered in ECT due to the possibility of increased risk of side effects."

Three self-rating questionnaires were completed when drug-free: the SCL-90 (an outpatient psychiatric symptom checklist), the impulsiveness venturesomeness and empathy (IVE) scale; and the uplifts, hassles, stresses and cognitive failures questionnaire. Heavy Ecstasy users reported significantly higher scores than controls on the following SCL-90 factors: paranoid ideation, psychoticism, somatisation, obsessionality, anxiety, hostility, phobic anxiety, altered appetite and restless sleep, together with greater IVE impulsiveness. Light ecstasy users generally produced intermediate scores, with significantly higher scores than controls on two factors and significantly lower scores than heavy ecstasy users on another two. Previous reports have described various psychiatric and psychobiological disorders in recreational ecstasy users, but it is not known how typical they are, being mainly based on individual case studies. This is the first study to describe psychological problems in a non clinical sample of young recreational ecstasy users. However, our ecstasy users were polydrug users, with both groups showing significantly greater usage of amphetamine, LSD and cocaine, than the controls. These other illicit drugs probably contributed to their adverse psychobiological profiles, while there is also the possibility of pre-existing differences between ecstasy users and non users. However, since repeated MDMA can cause serotonergic neurotoxicity in laboratory animals and man, these problems may reflect reduced serotonin activity induced by regular ecstasy use.

"4564","1","Ketamine-assisted psychotherapy (KPT) of alcoholism.^\nKetamine is a drug for general anesthesia, but in subanesthetic doses it induces profound psychedelic experiences and hallucinations. This property of ketamine was exploited in our use of ketamine-assisted psychotherapy for alcoholism. The results of the clinical trial testify to a considerable increase in the efficacy of alcoholism treatment owing to ketamine psychedelic therapy (KPT): a total abstinence for more than one year was observed in 73 out of 111 (65.8%) alcoholic patients of the KPT group, compared to 24% (24 out of 100 patients) of the conventional treatment control group (p < 0.01). The studies of the underlying psychological mechanisms of KPT have demonstrated that the ketamine-assisted psychedelic therapy of alcoholic patients induces a harmonization of the MMPI personality profile, positive transformation of non-verbalized (mostly unrealized) self-concept and emotional attitudes to various aspects of self and to other people, positive changes of life values and purposes, important insights into the meaning of life and a rise in the level of spiritual development. These psychological changes favored sober life. The data of biochemical investigations showed that the pharmacological action of KPT affects both monoaminergic and opiodergic neurotransmitter metabolism i.e., those neurochemical systems which are involved in the pathogenesis of alcohol dependence. The data of EEG computer-assisted analysis have shown that ketamine increases theta-activity in brain cortical regions of alcoholic patients. This is evidence of the reinforcement of limbic-cortex interaction during the KPT session."
"3642","0","Modulation of human GABAA receptor function: A novel mode of action of drugs of abuse.^\nDrugs of abuse are known to mainly affect the dopaminergic and serotonergic system, although behavioral studies indicated that the GABA-ergic system also plays a role. We therefore investigated the acute effects of several commonly used drugs of abuse (methamphetamine, amphetamine, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP)) on the function of the human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor (hGABAA-R), expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique. Although none of the tested drugs acted as full agonist on the hGABAA-R, some drugs induced differential modulation of hGABAA-R function, depending on the degree of receptor occupancy. Methamphetamine did not affect the GABA-evoked current at high receptor occupancy, but induced a minor inhibition at low receptor occupancy. Its metabolite amphetamine slightly potentiated the GABA-evoked current. MDMA and its metabolite MDA both inhibited the current at low receptor occupancy. However, MDMA did not affect the current at high occupancy, whereas MDA induced a potentiation. mCPP induced a strong inhibition (max ∼80%) at low receptor occupancy, but ∼25% potentiation at high receptor occupancy. Competitive binding to one of the GABA-binding sites could explain the drug-induced inhibitions observed at low receptor occupancy, whereas an additional interaction with a positive allosteric binding site may play a role in the observed potentiations at high receptor occupancy. This is the first study to identify direct modulation of hGABAA-Rs as a novel mode of action for several drugs of abuse.

This study aimed to investigate the perspectives of people with eating disorders on the use of complementary therapies and psychedelic research and treatment. Two hundred participants with eating disorders took part in this web survey study. The majority of participants (70%) had used a complementary treatment to manage their eating disorder. Participants believed that psychedelic research was worthwhile in the context of a moderate level of concern. The most popular solutions to meet these concerns included providing education around psychedelics and their effects and use in psychiatry and experiencing endorsement from professionals in the area. Moreover, participant responses emphasized the need for a safe, monitored environment and the patient-therapist rapport in the context of psychedelic treatment. The findings are explored concerning future trials of psychedelics as a treatment for eating disorders."
"443","0","MDMA for the Treatment of Negative Symptoms in Schizophrenia.^\nThe profound economic burden of schizophrenia is due, in part, to the negative symptoms of the disease, which can severely limit daily functioning. There is much debate in the field regarding their measurement and classification and there are no FDA-approved treatments for negative symptoms despite an abundance of research. 3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) is a schedule I substance that has emerged as a novel therapeutic given its ability to enhance social interactions, generate empathy, and induce a state of metaplasticity in the brain. This review provides a rationale for the use of MDMA in the treatment of negative symptoms by reviewing the literature on negative symptoms, their treatment, MDMA, and MDMA-assisted therapy. It reviews recent evidence that supports the safe and potentially effective use of MDMA to treat negative symptoms and concludes with considerations regarding safety and possible mechanisms of action."
"8402","0","Diminished reward responsiveness is associated with lower reward network GluCEST: an ultra-high field glutamate imaging study.^\nLow reward responsiveness (RR) is associated with poor psychological well-being, psychiatric disorder risk, and psychotropic treatment resistance. Functional MRI studies have reported decreased activity within the brain’s reward network in individuals with RR deficits, however the neurochemistry underlying network hypofunction in those with low RR remains unclear. This study employed ultra-high field glutamate chemical exchange saturation transfer (GluCEST) imaging to investigate the hypothesis that glutamatergic deficits within the reward network contribute to low RR. GluCEST images were acquired at 7.0 T from 45 participants (ages 15–29, 30 females) including 15 healthy individuals, 11 with depression, and 19 with psychosis spectrum symptoms. The GluCEST contrast, a measure sensitive to local glutamate concentration, was quantified in a meta-analytically defined reward network comprised of cortical, subcortical, and brainstem regions. Associations between brain GluCEST contrast and Behavioral Activation System Scale RR scores were assessed using multiple linear regressions. Analyses revealed that reward network GluCEST contrast was positively and selectively associated with RR, but not other clinical features. Follow-up investigations identified that this association was driven by the subcortical reward network and network areas that encode the salience of valenced stimuli. We observed no association between RR and the GluCEST contrast within non-reward cortex. This study thus provides new evidence that reward network glutamate levels contribute to individual differences in RR. Decreased reward network excitatory neurotransmission or metabolism may be mechanisms driving reward network hypofunction and RR deficits. These findings provide a framework for understanding the efficacy of glutamate-modulating psychotropics such as ketamine for treating anhedonia."
"4210","0","Substance use and suicide outcomes among self-injured trauma patients.^\nBackground: Research indicates alcohol (AUD) or substance (SUD) use disorders and acute alcohol or drug use serve as risk factors for suicidal behaviors and death both distally and proximally to a suicidal event. However, limited research has investigated these relationships among medically serious suicide attempters at the time of injury without relying on cohorts of substance users only or by examining suicide decedent characteristics. Methods: Data were collected from the National Trauma Data Bank (NTDB) for 2017. The sample comprised patients who engaged in suicidal and self-injurious acts that were medically serious enough to require trauma admission and were tested for alcohol (N = 9,196) or drug (N = 8,121) exposure upon admission. Logistic regression determined relationships between acute alcohol/substance use, presence of AUDs and SUDs and suicide mortality risk, while linear regression evaluated substance conditions and injury severity and length of stay (LOS). Results: AUDs (OR = 0.59[0.42−0.83]) and SUDs (OR = 0.66[0.48−0.90]) had reduced odds of death but increased LOS (β = 1.7, p < .001; β = 0.82, p = .024). Blood alcohol concentration (BAC) was positively associated with reduced odds of death (OR = 0.20[0.06−0.61]), injury severity (β = −5.3, p < .001), and LOS (β = −7.5, p < .001). Presence of cocaine (β = −0.80, p = .044) and opioids (β = −1.4, p < .001) were associated lower injury severity, while MDMA (β = 3.6, p = .016) and methamphetamine (β = 1.5, p = .025) were associated with increased injury severity. Conclusions: While higher BAC may be associated with lower odds of mortality during a single high-risk suicide event, substance users may be at increased risk for worse outcomes over time. Targeted interventions should be considered to interrupt and develop healthy alternatives for survivors with substance use conditions."

(see record [rid]2020-91544-073[/rid]). The authors assessed the comparative efficacy and tolerability of racemic and esketamine for the treatment of unipolar and bipolar major depression using 24 randomized controlled trials. We appreciate their insightful conclusions, however, there are some controversial details need to be explained or fixed. First, in the 'Search Strategy' section, the authors claimed that they included trials examining the use of ketamine in adults (aged 18 years or older), however, their search strategy might be not full-scale. For example. 'depressive disorder' and 'melancholia' should also be added in the search strategy. Second, in the 'Study selection' section, two studies, conducted by Grunebaum in 2017 (Grunebaum et al., 2017) and 2018 (Grunebaum et al., 2018) respectively, are likely to contain repeated data. Third, the number of patients included in the selected studies was different. There were only 9 patients in Berman et al.'s (2000) and Diazgranados et al.'s (2010) studies, while Fedgchin et al. (2019) recruited 445 patients. It is highly recommended to analyze these data in different subgroups, rather than use only one group, which can greatly increase the influence of small sample research, and those small sample researches are generally not reliable. Fourth, only funnel plot was applied in this study when assessing publication bias, however, funnel plot was not an accurate tool to evaluate this, Begg's test and Egger's test are usually applied on this occasion.

"3362","1","'Weddings, parties, anything...', a qualitative analysis of ecstasy use in Perth, Western Australia.^\nThis study investigates the patterns of use, the meanings associated with use, the perception of risk and the strategies adopted to reduce these risks for a sample of ecstasy users in Perth, Western Australia. The sample was purposively chosen to represent the heterogeneous nature of ecstasy users in Perth. Data were collected from 31 ecstasy users and 157 h of participant observation in a variety of settings. The study found that users exhibited a reasonable degree of control over their consumption, incorporating a series of risk reduction strategies. Application of these strategies was inconsistent, with a large percentage of the sample indulging in occasional binges, spontaneous purchases, polydrug use and purchasing from unknown individuals in clubs/pubs. As users became more experienced, they tended to become less concerned about the risks associated with use and exhibited greater risk taking behaviour. Understanding the beliefs and events that influence the adoption (or non-adoption) of harm reduction strategies and the heterogeneous nature of ecstasy users is important for future health promotion interventions and policy. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V."
"7062","1","The effect of 5-HT2A/1A agonist treatment on social cognition, empathy, and social decision making.^\nSocial cognition is a crucial factor influencing development, progress, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. However, social cognition skills are insufficiently targeted by current treatment approaches. In particular, patients suffering from depression show an increased negative reaction to social exclusion and deficits in empathy. The 5HT‐1A/2A receptor agonist psilocybin has previously been shown to reduce the neural response to negative emotional stimuli. However, it is not known if this extends to negative social interaction and whether 5HT‐1A/2A receptor stimulation induces changes in empathy. Given the clear need for improved treatment of sociocognitive functioning in psychiatric disorders, it is important to better understand the neuronal and neuromodulatory substrates of social cognition. In a double‐blind, randomized, cross‐over design we therefore investigated the neural response to ostracism after the acute administration of psilocybin (0.215mg/kg) and placebo in healthy volunteers using fMRI. Furthermore, we assessed cognitive and emotional empathy using the Multifaceted Empathy Test. The neural response to social exclusion in the ACC ‐ a brain region associated with 'social pain'‐ was reduced after psilocybin administration compared to placebo. Furthermore, emotional empathy was enhanced after treatment with psilocybin while no significant differences were found in cognitive empathy. These results show that the 5HT‐1A/2A receptor subtypes play an important role in the modulation of socio‐cognitive functioning and therefore may be relevant for the treatment of social cognition deficits in psychiatric disorders. In particular, they may be important for the normalization of empathy deficits and increased negative reaction to social exclusion in depressed patients."
"8180","1","Relationship of ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects in unipolar depression.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine and other NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) antagonists produce fast-acting antidepressant-like effects, although the underlying mechanism is unclear. Furthermore, high affinity NMDA antagonists such as ketamine are associated with psychotomimetic effects. To date the link between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of ketamine has not been explored. We examined the relationship between the antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects of a single ketamine infusion in subjects diagnosed with major depressive disorder. METHODS: In a double-blind, cross-over, placebo-controlled, two weeks clinical trial we studied the effects of ketamine (0.54 mg/kg within 30 min) in a group of 27 hospitalized depressive patients. RESULTS: Higher intensity of psychotomimetic symptoms, measured using BPRS, during ketamine administration correlated with alleviation in mood ratings during the following week with maximum on day seven. Ketamine was superior to placebo in all visits (day 1, 4, and 7) assessed by MADRS with effect size (Cohen´s d) of 0.62, 0.57, and 0.44 respectively. There was no significant correlation between ketamine and nor-ketamine plasma levels and MADRS score change at any study time point. CONCLUSION: The substantial relationship between ketamine's antidepressant and psychotomimetic effects was found. This relationship could be mediated by the initial steps of ketamine's action, trough NMDA receptors, shared by both ketamine's clinical effects."

Forty-eight subjects (30 males, mean age 23 years), self-nominating regular clubbers provided 'in the field' pre- and post-clubbing biological samples and associated information. Of the 39 subjects who provided a post-clubbing urine sample, 21 were positive for MDMA. Plasma cortisol concentrations increased in subjects (n=48) tested for cortisol, with changes being significantly greater in the MDMA-positive group (736.9±83.2 vs. 350.9±34.5mmol/l, p=0.001). We found a positive association between the low activity COMT genotype (Met/Met) and MDMA-induced change in cortisol and also between this and change in cortisol in the whole sample (p=0.039, Bonferroni corrected). For CYP2D6, there was an association between genotype and change in cortisol, confined to subjects with MDMA-positive urine post-clubbing (p=0.003, Bonferroni corrected). There was no association with 5-HTTLPR genotype. These associations suggest that chronic use of MDMA may lead to HPA axis dysregulation and that the magnitude of this may be moderated by genetic polymorphism, and warrant further investigation in a larger sample of those who consume the drug on a regular basis. © 2012 British Association for Psychopharmacology."
"5088","1","Use of repeated intravenous ketamine therapy in treatment-resistant bipolar depression with suicidal behaviour: a case report from Spain.^\nThe rapidly-acting antidepressant properties of ketamine are a trend topic in psychiatry. Despite its robust effects, these are ephemeral and can lead to certain adverse events. For this reason, there is still a general concern around the off-label use of ketamine in clinical practice settings. Nonetheless, for refractory depression, it should be an indication to consider. We report the case of a female patient admitted for several months due to a treatment-resistant depressive bipolar episode with chronic suicidal behaviour. After repeated intravenous ketamine infusions without remarkable side effects, the patient experienced a complete clinical recovery during the 4 weeks following hospital discharge. Unfortunately, depressive symptoms reappeared in the 5th week, and the patient was finally readmitted to hospital as a result of a suicide attempt."
"3111","1","Ketamine as a mental health treatment: Are acute psychoactive effects associated with outcomes? A systematic review.^\nEsketamine was recently licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and European Drug Agency (EDA) for use in treatment resistant depression (TRD), and further research indicates ketamine as a possible treatment in other mental health conditions. While the underlying mechanisms remain unclear, it has been hypothesised that ketamine's acute psychoactive effects may be associated with psychiatric treatment efficacy. We systematically reviewed the evidence for this association. The databases Medline, Embase and Psychlnfo were searched up to June 2019. Studies were included if they enrolled adults with a psychiatric diagnosis, assessed acute psychoactive effects using a quantitative measure, and reported on the relationship between acute effects and treatment outcome. We included 21 studies, involving 891 patients. Seventeen studies assessed patients with depression (TRD [k = 14]), three assessed substance use disorders, and one assessed social anxiety disorder. Overall, 41 associations were assessed, of which 26 % were significant. The studies reviewed displayed great variability in terms of methodology and quality of reporting. The most commonly assessed effect was dissociation, measured by the CADSS. Our results suggest that the CADSS total is not consistently associated with antidepressant outcomes. Apart from this, the current literature is too limited to draw definite conclusions on the presence of an association between acute psychoactive effects and mental health outcomes. The field would benefit from consistently employing a priori hypotheses, more transparent reporting and sufficiently powered statistical analyses. Furthermore, the use of a broader range of assessments tools of acute psychoactive effects during ketamine administration would be beneficial."
"7657","0","Psychedelic medicines for mood disorders: current evidence and clinical considerations.^\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: Despite advances in treatment modalities for mood disorders over recent decades, further therapeutic options are still required. Increased research is occurring, with the pursuit of psychedelic-based pharmacotherapies for a range of mood disorders and other conditions. RECENT FINDINGS: Serotonergic psychedelics have been found to modulate brain networks underlying various psychiatric disorders, as well promoting neurogenesis and neuroplasticity. Randomized placebo-controlled trials have found psilocybin with psychological support effective at treating depression, including treatment-resistant depression; with emergent research also signalling N,N-dimethyltryptamine/ayahuasca also as a potential option for the treatment of depression. Lysergic acid diethylamide has been found to have anxiolytic effects, whereas 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) has been used effectively to treat post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), with Phase III clinical trial evidence. Microdosing of psychedelics is a growing phenomenon that has shown benefits in some preclinical data; however, a recent self-directed controlled trial reported no evidence of improved mood. SUMMARY: Current research with medicinal psychedelics, usually as an adjunct to psychotherapy, has shown encouraging results in treating mood disorders. However, there are challenges regarding blinding and sample sizes remain small, and there have been no definitive Phase III studies (aside from MDMA for PTSD). Further work exploring novel formulations, interface with pharmacogenomics and the microbiome, and inflammatory pathways can be advised."
"916","0","Therapeutic Applications of Classic Hallucinogens.^\nThis chapter reviews what is known about the therapeutic uses of the serotonergic or classic hallucinogens, i.e., psychoactive drugs such as LSD and psilocybin that exert their effects primarily through agonist activity at serotonin 2A (5HT2A) receptors. Following a review of the history of human use and scientific study of these drugs, the data from clinical research are summarized, including extensive work on the use of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of alcoholism and other addictions, studies of the use of LSD and psilocybin to relieve distress concerning death, particularly in patients with advanced or terminal cancer, and more limited data concerning the use of classic hallucinogens to treat mood and anxiety disorders. A survey of possible mechanisms of clinically relevant effects is provided. The well-established safety of classic hallucinogens is reviewed. To provide a clinical perspective, case summaries are provided of two individuals who received treatment in recent controlled trials of psilocybin: one being treated for alcoholism, the other suffering from anxiety and depression related to fear of death due to a cancer diagnosis. Although promising early phase research conducted from the 1950s through the early 1970s was discontinued before firm conclusions could be reached concerning the efficacy of any of the classic hallucinogens for any clinical condition, the research that was conducted in that era strongly suggests that classic hallucinogens have clinically relevant effects, particularly in the case of LSD treatment of alcoholism. In the past decade, clinical trials have resumed investigating the effects of classic hallucinogens in the treatment of existential distress in the face of cancer, and in the treatment of addictions including alcoholism and nicotine addiction. The studies that have been completed to date are not sufficient to establish efficacy, but the outcomes have been very encouraging, and larger trials, up to and including phase 3, are now underway or being planned. Although research has elucidated many of the acute neurobiological and psychological effects of classic hallucinogens on humans, animals, and in vitro systems, the mechanisms of clinically relevant persisting effects remain poorly understood."
"4819","0","Ketamine/midazolam versus etomidate/fentanyl: procedural sedation for pediatric orthopedic reductions.^\nBACKGROUND: Orthopedic reductions are commonly performed procedures requiring sedation in the pediatric emergency department (PED). Ketamine is a widely used agent for pediatric procedural sedation, but its use may present difficulties in select populations, such as those with psychiatric diagnoses. In such a case, alternative agents that are safe and effective are needed. Etomidate is a commonly used induction agent for rapid-sequence intubation in the PED. Several retrospective and few prospective studies support etomidate's safety and efficacy in pediatric procedural sedation. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to compare etomidate/fentanyl (E/F) with ketamine/midazolam (K/M) for procedural sedation during orthopedic reductions in the PED. METHODS: Prospective, partially blinded, randomized controlled study comparing intravenously administered K/M with intravenously administered E/F. A convenience sample of patients, aged 5 to 18 years, presenting to an urban PED with fracture requiring reduction was enrolled. Outcome measures included guardian and staff completion of visual analog scale and Likert scales for observed pain and satisfaction, blinded OSBD-r (Observational Scale of Behavioral Distress-Revised) scoring of digital recordings of reductions, and sedation and recovery times. Descriptive tracking of adverse effects, adverse events, and interventions were recorded at the sedation. RESULTS: Twenty-three patients were enrolled, 11 in the K/M group and 12 in the E/F group. The K/M group had significantly lower mean OSBD-r scores compared with the E/F group (0.08 vs 0.89, P = 0.001). Parents rated lower visual analog scale scores with K/M than with E/F (13.7 vs 50.5, P = 0.003) and favored K/M on a 5-point satisfaction scale (P = 0.004). The E/F group had significantly shorter total sedation times (49.6 vs 77.6 minutes, P = 0.003) and recovery times (24.7 vs 61.4 minutes, P = 0.000). There were no significant differences with respect to procedural amnesia and orthopedic practitioner satisfaction. Adverse effects noted in the K/M group included dysphoric emergence reaction and vomiting. Vomiting, injection-site pain, myoclonus, airway readjustment, and supplemental oxygen use were observed in the E/F group. CONCLUSIONS: This is a small study that strongly suggests that, for pediatric orthopedic reductions, K/M is more effective at reducing observed distress than E/F, although both provide equal procedural amnesia. With its significantly shorter sedation and recovery times, E/F may be more applicable for procedural sedation for shorter, simpler procedures in the PED."

"9089","1","Bibliometric Analysis of Academic Journal Articles Reporting Results of Psychedelic Clinical Studies.^\nFollowing a decades long period of investigational dormancy, there is renewed interest in employing psychedelics as psychiatric treatments. The academic journals, institutions, and countries that have helped sustain clinical psychedelic research and the evolution of the literature on clinical studies of psychedelics have only recently begun to be investigated. To expand upon this work, we conducted a bibliometric analysis of clinical studies of 5-methoxy-N, N-dimethyltryptamine (5-MeO-DMT), ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine (DMT), lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), ibogaine, mescaline, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), and psilocybin published from 1965-2021. Our search revealed 394 relevant articles. After a lull from the 1970s-1990s, publications in this area have resurged. Studies most frequently focused on MDMA (49%), LSD (19%), psilocybin (18%), and ayahuasca (7%). A subanalysis of studies from 1965 to 2009 (""Older cohort"") compared to 2010-2021 (""Recent cohort"") revealed that the Recent cohort had a higher proportion of studies investigating psychedelics' therapeutic applications and a lower proportion of studies investigating the effects of psychedelics on people using them in non-research settings. Compared to the Older cohort, psilocybin studies increased proportionally in the Recent cohort, while DMT and mescaline studies decreased. Network analyses of inter-country collaborations suggested that psychedelic researchers in the United Kingdom have the most diverse international collaborations."
"5131","1","A randomized comparison of nitrous oxide plus hematoma block versus ketamine plus midazolam for emergency department forearm fracture reduction in children.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine provides effective and relatively safe sedation analgesia for reduction of fractures in children in the emergency department. However, prolonged recovery and adverse effects suggest the opportunity to develop alternative strategies. We compared the efficacy and adverse effects of ketamine/midazolam to those of nitrous oxide/hematoma block for analgesia and anxiolysis during forearm fracture reduction in children. METHODS: Children 5 to 17 years of age were randomly assigned to receive intravenous ketamine (1 mg/kg)/midazolam (0.1 mg/kg; max: 2.5 mg) or 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen and a hematoma block (2.5 mg/kg of 1% buffered lidocaine). All of the children received oral oxycodone 0.2 mg/kg (max: 15 mg) at triage > or = 45 minutes before reduction. Videotapes were obtained before (baseline), during (procedure), and after (recovery) reduction and scored using the Procedure Behavioral Checklist by an observer blinded to study purpose. The primary outcome measure was the mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist score from baseline to procedure, with greater change indicating greater procedure distress. Other outcome measures of efficacy included recovery times and visual analog scale scores to assess patient distress, parent report of child distress, and orthopedic surgeon satisfaction with sedation. Adverse effects were assessed during the emergency visit and by telephone 1 day after reduction. Data were analyzed using repeated measures, that is, analysis of variance, chi2, and t tests. RESULTS: There were 102 children (mean age: 9.0 +/- 3.0 years) who were randomly assigned. There was no difference in age, race, gender, and baseline Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores between ketamine/midazolam (55 subjects) and nitrous oxide/hematoma block (47 subjects). Mean changes in Procedure Behavioral Checklist scores were very small for both groups. The mean change in Procedure Behavioral Checklist was less for nitrous oxide/hematoma block, and patients and parents reported less pain during fracture reduction with nitrous oxide/hematoma block. Recovery times were markedly shorter for nitrous oxide/hematoma block compared with ketamine/midazolam. Orthopedic surgeons were similarly satisfied with the 2 regimens. Of the ketamine/midazolam subjects, 11% had O2 saturations < 94%. Other adverse effects occurred in both groups, but more often in ketamine/midazolam both during the emergency visit and at 1-day follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: In children who had received oral oxycodone, both nitrous oxide/hematoma block and ketamine/midazolam resulted in minimal increases in distress during forearm fracture reduction at the doses studied. The nitrous oxide/hematoma block regimen had fewer adverse effects and significantly less recovery time."
"9248","0","Effect of Psilocybin and Ketamine on Brain Neurotransmitters, Glutamate Receptors, DNA and Rat Behavior.^\nClinical studies provide evidence that ketamine and psilocybin could be used as fast-acting antidepressants, though their mechanisms and toxicity are still not fully understood. To address this issue, we have examined the effect of a single administration of ketamine and psilocybin on the extracellular levels of neurotransmitters in the rat frontal cortex and reticular nucleus of the thalamus using microdialysis. The genotoxic effect and density of glutamate receptor proteins was measured with comet assay and Western blot, respectively. An open field test, light-dark box test and forced swim test were conducted to examine rat behavior 24 h after drug administration. Ketamine (10 mg/kg) and psilocybin (2 and 10 mg/kg) increased dopamine, serotonin, glutamate and GABA extracellular levels in the frontal cortex, while psilocybin also increased GABA in the reticular nucleus of the thalamus. Oxidative DNA damage due to psilocybin was observed in the frontal cortex and from both drugs in the hippocampus. NR2A subunit levels were increased after psilocybin (10 mg/kg). Behavioral tests showed no antidepressant or anxiolytic effects, and only ketamine suppressed rat locomotor activity. The observed changes in neurotransmission might lead to genotoxicity and increased NR2A levels, while not markedly affecting animal behavior."
"9484","1","Replication of ketamine's antidepressant efficacy in bipolar depression: a randomized controlled add-on trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Currently, no pharmacological treatments for bipolar depression exist that exert rapid (within hours) antidepressant or antisuicidal effects. We previously reported that intravenous administration of the N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist ketamine produced rapid antidepressant effects in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression. The present study sought to replicate this finding in an independent sample. METHODS: In this double-blind, randomized, crossover, placebo-controlled study, 15 subjects with DSM-IV bipolar I or II depression maintained on therapeutic levels of lithium or valproate received a single intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 test days 2 weeks apart. The primary outcome measure was the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale, which was used to rate overall depressive symptoms at baseline; at 40, 80, 110, and 230 minutes postinfusion; and on days 1, 2, 3, 7, 10, and 14 postinfusion. RESULTS: Within 40 minutes, depressive symptoms, as well as suicidal ideation, significantly improved in subjects receiving ketamine compared with placebo (d = .89, 95% confidence interval = .61-1.16, and .98, 95% confidence interval = .64-1.33, respectively); this improvement remained significant through day 3. Seventy-nine percent of subjects responded to ketamine and 0% responded to placebo at some point during the trial. The most common side effect was dissociative symptoms, which occurred only at the 40-minute time point. CONCLUSIONS: This study replicated our previous finding that patients with bipolar depression who received a single ketamine infusion experienced a rapid and robust antidepressant response. In addition, we found that ketamine rapidly improved suicidal ideation in these patients."
"8293","1","Who is becoming hallucinogen dependent soon after hallucinogen use starts?.^\nThis study, based upon epidemiological survey data from the United States (U.S.) National Household Surveys on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) from 2000 to 2001, presents new estimates for the risk of developing a hallucinogen dependence syndrome within 24 months after first use of any hallucinogen (median elapsed time approximately 12 months). Subgroup variations in risk of becoming hallucinogen dependent also are explored. Estimates are derived from the NHSDA representative samples of non-institutionalized U.S. residents ages 12 and older (n=114,241). A total of 2035 respondents had used hallucinogens for the first time within 24 months prior to assessment. An estimated 2-3% of these recent-onset hallucinogen users had become dependent on hallucinogens, according to the NHSDA DSM-IV computerized diagnostic algorithm. Controlling for sociodemographic and other drug use covariates, very early first use of hallucinogens (age 10-11 years) is associated with increased risk of hallucinogen dependence (p<0.01). Excess risk of developing hallucinogen dependence was found in association with recent-onset use of mescaline; excess risk also was found for recent-onset users of ecstasy and of PCP. This study's evidence is consistent with prior evidence on a tangible but quite infrequent dependence syndrome soon after the start of hallucinogen use; it offers leads that can be confirmed or disconfirmed in future investigations."
"2988","1","Low doses of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) increase reward-related brain activity.^\nRenewed interest in classic psychedelics as treatments for psychiatric disorders warrants a deeper understanding of their neural mechanisms. Single, high doses of psychedelic drugs have shown promise in treating depressive disorders, perhaps by reversing deficits in reward processing in the brain. In addition, there are anecdotal reports that repeated ingestion of low doses of LSD, or ""microdosing"", improve mood, cognition, and feelings of wellbeing. However, the effects of low doses of classic psychedelics on reward processing have not been studied. The current study examined the effects of two single, low doses of LSD compared to placebo on measures of reward processing. Eighteen healthy adults completed three sessions in which they received placebo (LSD-0), 13 μg LSD (LSD-13) and 26 μg LSD (LSD-26) in a within-subject, double-blind design. Neural activity was recorded while participants completed the electrophysiological monetary incentive delay task. Event-related potentials were measured during feedback processing (Reward-Positivity: RewP, Feedback-P3: FB-P3, and Late-Positive Potential: LPP). Compared to placebo, LSD-13 increased RewP and LPP amplitudes for reward (vs. neutral) feedback, and LSD-13 and LSD-26 increased FB-P3 amplitudes for positive (vs. negative) feedback. These effects were unassociated with most subjective measures of drug effects. Thus, single, low doses of LSD (vs. placebo) increased three reward-related ERP components reflecting increased hedonic (RewP), motivational (FB-P3), and affective processing of feedback (LPP). These results constitute the first evidence that low doses of LSD increase reward-related brain activity in humans. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of depressive disorders."
"4634","1","MDMA, oxytocin and empathy: preliminary results from a placebo controlled study.^\nObjective: Background. The neurobiological mechanism underlying MDMA‐induced prosocial behaviour (PSB) is yet not known. Two potential mediators of these effects are oxytocin and the serotonin (5‐HT) 1a‐receptor as they seem to play a role in facilitation of positive mood, empathy and social interaction. Moreover, MDMA is known to increase blood oxytocin levels and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor is a mediator of the effects of MDMA and oxytocin. The study aim is to investigate the roles of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in the MDMA‐induced PSB effects. Methods: Twenty participants will participate in this 4 waycrossover study (currently N=5). Treatments are MDMA (75 mg, oral) alone, and in combination with a 5‐HT1a antagonist (pindolol, 20mg, oral), Oxytocin (48 IU, intranasal), and placebo. Empathy and mood are assessed by means of two computer tasks (Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test and the Multifaceted Empathy test) and a questionnaire (Profile of Mood States). It is hypothesized that oxytocin will mimic MDMA‐induced prosocial effects and that the 5‐HT1Areceptor is an important mediator of these effects. Results: Preliminary analyses of both empathy tests did not reveal statistically significant main effects of treatment. Analyses of the POMS revealed a main effect of treatment on the 'vigor' scale (Figure presented) (p=0.032) and a trend on the 'arousal' and ' elation' scale. These 'stimulant' effects were caused by the combined treatment and oxytocin. Closer inspection of the data however leads to the suggestion that an increase in power will lead to significant effects (also of MDMA) on more scales. Conclusion: The data of the POMS questionnaire suggest that the three active treatments have 'stimulant ' effects on different mood states. Inclusion of more subjects will provide more clarity on the role of oxytocin and the 5‐HT1a‐receptor in MDMA‐induced PSB."
"4725","0","Novel harmala-ocudelic tuning (HOT) for ocular disorders.^\nThe eye contains serotonin, and possesses serotonergic receptors and modulators. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) may impair ocular function, while other serotonin receptor-binding drugs might improve it. A putative vision-improving drug must be safe at therapeutic doses, most preferably with long-lasting benefits from a single or very few administration(s). One drug potentially satisfying these criteria is the common, botanically-occurring indole alkaloid and ""major hallucinogen,"" harmine. Harmine is prominent in the leaves of the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) Passiflora, and in Peganum and Banisteriopsis, the two preeminent ""sacred"" medicinal plants of India/pre-Islamic Persia/modern Iran and the Amazon respectively. Though the possibility of drug-drug or herb-drug interactions exists, especially with SSRIs, at correct patient-individualized dosages, these plants, used alone, are minimally hallucinogenic, well tolerated, potentially exerting profound therapeutic effects on vision from a single or few administration(s) lasting months or years. The hypothesized mechanism for this extraordinary action is tuning of the serotonergic receptors in the eye in their binding affinity for serotonin, a putative neurochemical ""ocudelic"" homologue to the psychedelic phenomenon, likely potentiated, according to clinical experience with classical hallucinogens, by therapeutic music, positive psychological ""set,"" and conducive environmental ""setting."" Blinded research with harmala alkaloid-containing plants in ocular patients using psychedelic therapy accoutrements, viz. eyeshades, high fidelity classical music, headphones, two guides, pre-dosing preparation, and post-dosing integration, could non-invasively assess visual acuity in presbyopia. Significant results would stimulate further exploration of this novel approach to ocular disorders. Deeper benefit, particularly when the retina is compromised, might follow co-ingestion of the harmala alkaloid-containing plants with plants containing dimethyltryptamine."
"937","0","Analgesic potential of macrodoses and microdoses of classical psychedelics in chronic pain sufferers: a population survey.^\nAlthough several studies and reports have shown the potential analgesic use of serotonergic psychedelics in cancer pain, phantom limb pain and cluster headache, evidence supporting their use for chronic pain is still limited. The past years have seen a considerable renewal of interest toward the therapeutic use of these compounds for mood disorders, resulting in a marked increase in the number of people turning to psychedelics in an attempt to self-medicate a health condition or improve their wellbeing. In western countries particularly, this population of users overlaps substantially with chronic pain sufferers, representing a unique opportunity to evaluate the effects these compounds have on pain and wellbeing. Here, we report results from an online survey conducted between August 2020 and July 2021 in a population of 250 chronic pain sufferers who had experience with psychedelics, either in microdoses (small sub-hallucinogenic doses), macrodoses (hallucinogenic doses), or both. Macrodoses, while less often used for analgesic purposes than microdoses, were reported to induce a higher level of pain relief than both microdoses and conventional pain medications (including opioids and cannabis). Although the effects were weaker and potentially more prone to expectation bias than with macrodoses, our results also suggested some benefits of psychedelics in microdoses for pain management. The reported analgesic effect appeared unrelated to mood improvements associated with psychedelic use, or the advocacy of psychedelic use. Taken together, our findings indicate interesting potential analgesic applications for psychedelics that warrant further clinical research."
"372","0","Nasal administration of Esketamine-a promising new antidepressant.^\nMajor depressive disorder (MDD) is considered a large health concern, and one third have a treatment‐resistant depression (TRD). This has consequences for the affected individual, and is associated with a significant economic burden on our society. Despite the large public health impact, the there are few new major breakthroughs in pharmacological agents since the introduction of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors in the 1980's. The N‐methyl‐D‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist ketamine has emerged as a promising therapeutic agent, with intravenous (IV) administration demonstrating rapid antidepressant effects and striking response rates. Recently the results from the first clinical trial of intranasal esketamine, which is the more potent Senantiomer of ketamine, as adjunctive to antidepressants in TRD was reported (Daly et al, 2017). The study was a randomized, double‐blind trial including 67 participants with TRD, who continued their existing antidepressant treatment. The results show that twice weekly administration of esketamine has a significant effect on depressive symptoms (MADRS) as early as 1 week of treatment. Another interesting aspect of the study was the use of intranasal drug delivery, which is receiving increasing attention in psychiatry (Quintana et al. 2016). The previous findings of antidepressant effect are mainly based on IV administration. This limits the use of Esketamine in outpatient clinics and primary care. Intranasal administration also increases bioavailability compared to oral administration, due to the avoidance of first pass liver metabolism."
"3449","1","Neurocognitive and behavioural performance of healthy volunteers receiving an increasing analgesic-range infusion of ketamine.^\nBackground: The acute and delayed effect of analgesic-range doses of ketamine on neurocognitive and behavioural outcomes is understudied. Using a non-controlled open-labelled design, three (1-h duration) increasing intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions comprising (i) 30 mg bolus of ketamine + 8 mg/h IV infusion, (ii) 12 mg/h IV infusion and (iii) 20 mg/h infusion were administered to 20 participants (15 male, 5 female, mean age = 30.8 years). Whole-blood ketamine and norketamine concentrations were determined at each treatment step and post-infusion. Methods: The Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB) was used to assess reaction/movement time (RTI, Simple and 5-Choice), visuospatial working memory (SWM), spatial planning (SOC) and subjective effects (visual analogue scale; VAS) during treatment and at post-treatment. Results: Significant main effects were reported for time (dose) on CANTAB RTI 5-Choice reaction (F(4,18) = 3.41, p = 0.029) and movement time (F(4,18) = 4.42, p = 0.011), SWM (F(4,18) = 4.19, p = 0.014) and SOC (F(4,18) = 4.13, p = 0.015), but not RTI Simple reaction or movement time. Post hoc analyses revealed dose-dependent effects for both RTI 5-Choice reaction and movement time (all p < 0.05). Post-treatment performance on all neurocognitive and behavioural tasks returned to baseline levels. Regression analyses revealed a weak positive linear association between SWM ‘strategy’ score (R² = 0.103, p < 0.001), all performance-based CANTAB VAS items (R² range 0.005–0.137, all p < 0.05) and ketamine blood concentrations. Discussion: The open-label, non-controlled trial design somewhat precludes the ability to adequately account for random treatment effects. Notwithstanding, these results suggest that analgesic doses of ketamine produce acute, selective, dose-dependent deficits in higher-order neurocognitive and behavioural domains.

"1221","0","Treating cigarette smoking in drug-abusing clients.^\nClients in substance abuse treatment are at high risk for smoking‐related illness due to higher rates and heavier smoking than the general population. Three myths widely held by both treatment staff and substance abusers in treatment‐people in treatment do not want to quit smoking, people in treatment will relapse to other drug use if they attempt to quit smoking, and people in treatment are unable to quit smoking‐make it difficult to broach the matter of smoking cessation. A 16‐week, cognitive‐behavioral group program with nicotine patches was conducted at Oregon's largest, private, nonprofit substance abuse treatment agency. Of 490 clients, approximately 85% of whom smoke, 106 (25% of the smokers) were interested enough in quitting to attend an orientation. Approximately 40% of these were methadone maintenance clients. The others were distributed among two residential and two outpatient drug‐free treatment services. Of 90 assigned, 68 began voluntary treatment, and 21 were assigned to delayed treatment. Of the 66 smokers who began, 74% succeeded in quitting smoking for at least 1 day, and 23% were abstinent for at least 4 continuous weeks. At the end of the 16‐week treatment, 7 subjects (11%) were abstinent. No control subjects quit smoking on their own. The article discusses issues of institutionalizing smoking cessation services in drug treatment agencies."
"4349","1","Decreases in State and Trait Anxiety Post-psilocybin: A Naturalistic, Observational Study Among Retreat Attendees.^\nAnxiety disorders are the most common type of psychiatric disorders among Western countries. Evidence-based treatment modalities including pharmacological and cognitive-behavioral therapy result in deficient treatment responses. Historical and recent research suggests psychedelic drugs may be efficacious in alleviating anxiety-related symptoms among healthy and clinical populations. The main aim of the present study was investigation of the effects of psilocybin-containing truffles, when taken in a supportive group setting, on ratings of state and trait anxiety across self-reported healthy volunteers. Attendees of psilocybin ceremonies were asked to complete a test battery at three separate occasions: before the ceremony (baseline), the morning after, and 1 week after the ceremony. The test battery included questionnaires assessing state and trait anxiety (State-Trait Anxiety Inventory), mindfulness capacities (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire), and personality (Big Five Inventory). Additionally, the psychedelic experience was quantified with the Persisting Effects Questionnaire and the Ego Dissolution Inventory. The total amount of psilocybin-containing truffles consumed by each participant was recorded, and a sample of the truffles was analyzed to determine psilocin concentrations. Fifty-two attendees (males = 25; females = 25; others = 2) completed parts of the baseline assessment, 46 (males = 21; females = 24; others = 1) completed assessments the morning after the ceremony, and 23 (males = 10; females = 13) completed assessments at the 1-week follow-up. Average psilocin consumption across individuals was 27.1 mg. The morning after the ceremony, we observed medium reductions in anxiety measures (both state and trait) compared to baseline ( d¯ = 6.4; p < 0.001 and d¯ = 6; p = 0.014, respectively), which persisted over a 1-week period post-ceremony ( d¯ = 6.7; p = 0.001 and d¯ = 8.6; p = 0.004, respectively). At 1 week post-ceremony, the non-judging facet of the mindfulness scale was increased ( d¯ = 1.5; p = 0.03), while the personality trait neuroticism decreased ( d¯ = 5.2; p = 0.005), when compared to baseline. Additionally, we found ratings of ego dissolution (mean: 59.7, SD: 28.3) and changes in neuroticism to be the strongest predictors of reductions in state and trait anxiety, respectively. In sum, results suggest rapid and persisting (up to 1 week) anxiolytic effects in individuals with sub-clinical anxiety symptoms, which are related to the acute experience of ego dissolution, as well as lasting changes in trait neuroticism. Results also add support to the feasibility and potential efficacy of group sessions with psychedelics. To understand whether these effects extend to wider populations suffering from heightened anxiety, and the mechanisms involved, further experimental research is needed."

A model of understanding the brain function in childhood psychosis and its treatment.^\nComputer analysis of the electroencephalogram (CEEG) in psychotic children before and after pharmacotherapy, normal children of schizophrenic mothers, and matched normal children of normal parents indicated significant intergroup differences. The psychotic children had more slow, as well as very fast, EEG waves. With drug therapy the EEG showed a partial 'normalization,' as fast EEG activity decreased. The EEG and auditory evoked potential of children of schizophrenic mothers were strikingly similar to those of psychotic children and schizophrenic adults, with significant decreases of the average EEG amplitude and the evoked potential latencies. Psychotic children were distinctly differentiated from the normal children by discriminant function analysis of the EEG and evoked potential. Quantitative analysis of brain functions in the mentally ill can help determine the neurophysiological correlates of behavior, a more scientific diagnostic classification, prognosis, and selection of therapy."

However, treatment options are limited. OBJECTIVE To determine the clinically recommended dose of difelikefalin, a K-opioid receptor agonist, based on the efficacy, dose response, safety, and pharmacokinetics. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-arm phase 2 trial was conducted from February 1, 2019, to October 22, 2019, at 94sites in Japan. Patients with moderate to severe pruritus receiving hemodialysis were enrolled. INTERVENTIONS Difelikefalin (0.25, 0.5, and 1.0 pg/kg) and placebo were intravenously administered 3 times a week at the end of each hemodialysis session for 8 weeks. MAIN OUTCOME AND MEASURES The primary end point was the change from baseline in the weekly mean Worst Itching Intensity Numerical Rating Scale (NRS) score at week 8. Secondary outcomes measured changes in itch-related quality-of-life score using the Skindex-16 and 5-D itch scale. Safety was assessed according to adverse events, laboratory tests, vital signs, body weight, and 12-lead electrocardiogram. Results A total of 247 Japanese patients (186 male [75%]; mean [SD] age, 64.5 [11.7] years) were randomized to placebo (n = 63), 0.25 mu g/kg of difelikefalin (n = 61), 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin (n = 61), or 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin (n = 62). The changes from baseline in the adjusted mean (SE) of the 24-hour Worst Itching Intensity NRS score at week 8 were -2.86 (0.29) in the placebo group, -2.97 (0.29) in the 0.25 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group, -3.65 (0.30) in the 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group, and -3.64 (0.30) in the 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group. Significant differences were found in the 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group (adjusted mean difference, -0.80; 95% CI, -1.55 to -0.04; P = .04) and the 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group (adjusted mean difference, -0.78; 95% CI, -1.54 to -0.03; P = .04) compared with placebo. The Skindex-16 overall score and 5-D itch scale total score indicated an improvement with treatment with 0.5 and 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin (adjusted weekly mean [SE] Skindex-16 overall score at week 8, -27.79 [2.05]; 95% CI, -31.83 to -23.74 for 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin and -22.69 [2.04]; 95% CI, -26.71 to -18.68 for 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin; adjusted weekly mean [SE] 5-D itch scale total score at week 8, -6.5 [0.4]; 95% CI, -7.2 to -5.8 for 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin and -6.8 [0.3]; 95% CI, -7.5 to -6.2 for 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin). The incidence of adverse events was 67% (42 of 63 patients) in the placebo group, 72% (44 of 61 patients) in the 0.25 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group, 77% (47 of 61 patients) in the 0.5 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group, and 85% (53 of 62 patients) in the 1.0 mu g/kg of difelikefalin group. No dependency was reported. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The findings of this phase 2 randomized clinical trial of difelikefalin suggest that 0.5 pg/kg of difelikefalin should be the clinically recommended dose as a new option fortreating moderate to severe pruritus in patients undergoing hemodialysis because of its efficacy, acceptable tolerability, and manageable safety profile."
"7727","1","Exploratory investigation of a patient-informed low-dose psilocybin pulse regimen in the suppression of cluster headache: Results from a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial.^\nOBJECTIVE: Using a patient-informed regimen, we conducted an exploratory randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to systematically investigate the effects of psilocybin in cluster headache. BACKGROUND: Sustained reductions in cluster headache burden after limited quantities of psilocybin-containing mushrooms are anecdotally reported, although to date there are no controlled studies investigating these effects. METHODS: Participants were randomized to receive psilocybin (0.143 mg/kg) or placebo (microcrystalline cellulose) in a pulse of three doses, each ~5 days apart. Participants maintained headache diaries starting 2 weeks before and continuing through 8 weeks after the first drug session. A total of 16 participants were randomized to receive experimental drug and 14 were included in the final analysis. RESULTS: In the 3 weeks after the start of the pulse regimen, the change in cluster attack frequency was 0.03 (95% confidence interval [CI] -2.6 to 2.6) attacks/week with placebo (baseline 8.9 [95% CI 3.8 to 14.0]) and -3.2 (95% CI -8.3 to 1.9) attacks/week with psilocybin (baseline 9.6 [95% CI 5.6 to 13.6]; p = 0.251). Group difference in change from baseline had a moderate effect size (d = 0.69). The effect size was small in episodic participants (d = 0.35) but large in chronic participants (d = 1.25), which remained over the entire 8-week period measured (d = 0.81). Changes in cluster attack frequency were not correlated with the intensity of acute psychotropic effects during psilocybin administration. Psilocybin was well-tolerated without any unexpected or serious adverse events. CONCLUSIONS: Findings from this initial, exploratory study provide valuable information for the development of larger, more definitive studies. Efficacy outcomes were negative, owing in part to the small number of participants. The separation of acute psychotropic effects and lasting therapeutic effects underscores the need for further investigation into the mechanism(s) of action of psilocybin in headache disorders."
"9122","0","Psilocybin in Palliative Care: An Update.^\nPURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review article summarizes clinically and socially relevant developments over the past five years in the therapeutic use of the classical tryptamine psychedelic substance psilocybin, with respect to the common challenges faced by palliative care patients and their care teams. Psilocybin is available in whole fungal and isolated forms but is not yet approved for therapeutic use in the United States. Using targeted database and gray literature searches, and author recall, key sources were identified, reviewed, and synthesized as to the safety and efficacy of psilocybin in palliative care. RECENT FINDINGS: Life-threatening or life-limiting illnesses and faced by palliative care patients are comorbid with emotional and spiritual distress. Research and field reports reviewed suggest that psilocybin has significant and in some cases, sustained anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects with a favorable safety profile. Limitations of the research include the risk for selection bias toward healthy, white, financially privileged individuals, and in general, follow-up timelines too short to appropriately evaluate durability of outcomes in psychospiritual benefits and quality of life. SUMMARY: While more research is needed for palliative care populations specifically, reasonable inferences can be made regarding the potential for benefit to palliative care patients from psilocybin's demonstrated anxiolytic, antidepressant, anti-inflammatory and entheogenic effects. However, major legal, ethical and financial barriers to access exist for the general population; obstacles which are likely worsened for geriatric and palliative care patients. Empiric treatment and large-scale controlled trials of psilocybin should be conducted to further investigate the findings of the smaller studies reviewed here across a variety of populations, for a greater understanding of therapeutic benefit and clinically relevant safety criteria, and to support thoughtful legalization and medical access."
"1556","0","Communication intervention in the neonatal intensive care unit: can it backfire?.^\nBACKGROUND: For parents of a critically ill infant, good communication may help alleviate stress and anxiety. To improve communication, physicians must be responsive to families' needs and values surrounding the care of their hospitalized infant. OBJECTIVE: We adapted a Decision-Making Tool for the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (N-DMT) to encourage consideration of family concerns and preferences in daily care planning. DESIGN: This was a randomized controlled design. SETTING/SUBJECTS: Parents and providers of critically ill neonates were eligible. Parents were randomized to an intervention group (using the N-DMT) or standard of care. N-DMT information was shared through the electronic medical record and communicated directly to the primary provider. MEASUREMENTS: Daily rounds on all infants were audio recorded. Parents completed the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory at the first interview and 2 weeks later. Parents completed the Family Inventory of Needs-Pediatrics (FIN-PED) survey and an N-DMT-specific survey 2 weeks postenrollment. RESULTS: Complete data were obtained on 10 control and 9 intervention families. Groups did not differ on demographics or mean infant Score of Neonatal Acute Physiology (SNAP) scores (36 versus 37). FIN-PED scores were similar for both groups. The control group showed decreased anxiety over time. The content of rounds did not differ between groups. The intervention group reported lower satisfaction with care, specifically in questions regarding communication. CONCLUSIONS: In this pilot study, we found that families in the intervention group were less satisfied with communication. Families who are primed to expect better communication, such as those participating in a communication intervention, may be less satisfied with standard care."
"6677","1","Human Pharmacology of Mephedrone in Comparison with MDMA.^\nMephedrone (4-methylmethcathinone) is a novel psychoactive substance popular among drug users because it displays similar effects to MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, ecstasy). Mephedrone consumption has been associated with undesirable effects and fatal intoxications. At present, there is no research available on its pharmacological effects in humans under controlled and experimental administration. This study aims to evaluate the clinical pharmacology of mephedrone and its relative abuse liability compared with MDMA. Twelve male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, and placebo-controlled trial. The single oral dose conditions were: mephedrone 200 mg, MDMA 100 mg, and placebo. Outcome variables included physiological, subjective, and psychomotor effects, and pharmacokinetic parameters. The protocol was registered in ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02232789). Mephedrone produced a significant increase in systolic and diastolic blood pressure, heart rate, and pupillary diameter. It elicited stimulant-like effects, euphoria, and well-being, and induced mild changes in perceptions with similar ratings to those observed after MDMA administration although effects peaked earlier and were shorter in duration. Maximal plasma concentration values for mephedrone and MDMA peaked at 1.25 h and 2.00 h, respectively. The elimination half-life for mephedrone was 2.15 h and 7.89 h for MDMA. In a similar manner to MDMA, mephedrone exhibits high abuse liability. Its earlier onset and shorter duration of effects, probably related to its short elimination half-life, could explain a more compulsive pattern of use as described by the users."
"4322","0","Hair analysis for drug abuse XV. Disposition of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its related compounds into rat hair and application to hair analysis for MDMA abuse.^\nIn order to clarify the mechanism of drug incorporation into hair, disposition of 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), 3-methoxy-4,5-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MMDA) and metabolites of MDMA, 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMAP) and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), into hair was investigated with an animal model. After the intraperitoneal administration of those six drugs to pigmented hairy rats (5 mg/kg/day, 10 days, n = 3), the parent compounds and their metabolites in the rat plasma (5, 15, 30, 60, 120, 360 min after administration) and in the newly grown rat hair for 4 weeks were determined by GC/MS-SIM. When the ratio of hair concentration to area under the concentration versus time curves (AUCs) in plasma was represented as an index of incorporation rate (ICR) of drugs into hair, the order of ICRs was HMAP < MDA < HMMA < MDMA < MDEA < MMDA. In the comparison between MDA, MDMA and MDEA, their ICRs increased according to the length of carbon branches from proton to ethyl at the N position. From the point of view that the ICRs of MMDA was 2.3 times as much as that of MDA, the methoxy group on the benzene ring seemed to serve as a positive factor for the ICR. However, the ICRs of 4-hydroxy-3-methoxy compounds, HMAP and HMMA, were lower in comparison with those of MDA and MDMA, respectively. On the other hand, the ICRs of MDA, MDMA and MDEA were 5.5-6.1 times larger than those of amphetamine, methamphetamine and ethylamphetamine, suggesting that the methylenedioxy group on the benzene ring raises their ICRs very positively. Moreover, in order to apply the results from the animal experiments to human cases, the scalp hair samples of seven MDMA abusers were analyzed. MDMA and its metabolites, MDA, were simultaneously detected in all the samples by GC/MS. In the two samples, MDEA was found in addition to MDMA and MDA. It was shown that a hair sample is a good specimen for the confirmation of retrospective use of methylenedioxyamphetamines."
"4354","1","Prosocial effects of MDMA: A measure of generosity.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) produces ""prosocial"" effects that contribute to its recreational use. Few studies have examined the cognitive and behavioral mechanisms by which MDMA produces these effects. Here we examined the effect of MDMA on a specific prosocial effect, i.e. generosity, using a task in which participants make decisions about whether they or another person will receive money (Welfare Trade-Off Task; WTT). METHODS: The project included one study without drug administration and one with MDMA. In Study 1, we administered the WTT to healthy adults (N = 361) and examined their performance in relation to measures of personality and socioeconomic status. In Study 2, healthy volunteers with MDMA experience (N = 32) completed the WTT after MDMA administration (0, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg). RESULTS: As expected, in both studies participants were more generous with a close friend than an acquaintance or stranger. In Study 1, WTT generosity was related to household income and trait Agreeableness. In Study 2, MDMA (1.0 mg/kg) increased generosity toward a friend but not a stranger, whereas MDMA (0.5 mg/kg) slightly increased generosity toward a stranger, especially among female participants. CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that the WTT is a valuable, novel tool to assess a component of prosocial behavior, i.e. generosity to others. The findings support growing evidence that MDMA produces prosocial effects, but, as with oxytocin, these appear to depend on the social proximity of the relationships. The brain mechanisms underlying the construct of generosity, or the effects of MDMA on this measure, remain to be determined."

Psilocybin induces desynchronization of the EEG during the peak of its effects, continuous data are lacking. Objectives.‐ We focused on the dynamics of changes in neuropsychological parameters, brain activity and connectivity after oral administration of psilocybin. Methods.‐ Twenty healthy volunteers (10 M/10F, 28‐50yrs) were enrolled in this placebo controlled cross over double blind trial. A standard 19 channel EEG (registered before and 60, 90, 180 and 360 min after psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) ingestion), brief psychiatric rating scale (BPRS), plasma levels of psilocin were collected several times over the session, a subjective scale “altered scale of consciousness scale (ASCs)” at the end of measurements. Current source density and connectivity were analysed by Low Resolution Brain Electromagnetic Tomography (LORETA). Results.‐ Psilocybin induced psychotic‐like symptoms, especially changes in perception and thought disturbances, peaking at 90 min after ingestion along with serum psilocin levels. Induced global decrease of the alpha current source density in the occipital cortex was negatively correlated with the intensity of effects. The overall connectivity decreased in the alpha band, but increased in all other frequency bands at peak, however, six hours after ingestion, the effects were inverted. Conclusions.‐ The study shows that psilocybin dynamically shifts the brain from one connectivity state at baseline through a peak effect to reach another global connectivity state at the end.

In Part 1, 16 subjects will receive open‐label SLS‐002 (90 mg). Part 2 of the study is double‐blind and 220 subjects will be randomized 1:1 to receive either SLS‐002 (90 mg) or matching placebo. The Johns Hopkins Hospital Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Sciences will be working with Seelos Therapeutics on Part 2 of the study with an estimated enrollment of 10 participants. After admission to the emergency room or hospital, each subject will participate in a 1‐ to 2‐day screening phase, a 16‐day treatment phase including standard of care during which study drug will be administered 2 times per week for a total of 5 doses, and a 2‐week safety follow‐up phase for a total of up to 5 weeks of study participation. Subjects will be treated as inpatients for approximately 7 days (including screening), and assuming the subject meets readiness for discharge criteria, will be discharged on Day 6 to continue the trial as outpatients, provided it is clinically appropriate to do so."
"2161","1","MDMA Impairs Both the Encoding and Retrieval of Emotional Recollections.^\nThe psychoactive drug ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is increasingly used for its perceived emotional effects (eg, prosociality, empathy, psychotherapy), but surprisingly little research has been aimed at identifying the effect of the drug on emotional episodic memory in humans. Here, we report the first double-blind placebo-controlled study to examine the effects of MDMA on emotional memory separately during encoding and retrieval in healthy participants. Participants viewed emotionally negative, neutral, and positive pictures and their labels. Forty-eight hours later, they were given cued recollection and recognition memory tests designed to assess recollection and familiarity for the studied pictures. Participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups who received MDMA (1 mg/kg) either during encoding (Encoding group; N=20), retrieval (Retrieval group; N=20), or neither (Placebo group; N=20). Although MDMA administered at either phase did not affect overall memory accuracy, it did alter the recollection of details associated specifically with emotional memories as estimated using a dual process signal detection analysis of confidence judgments and subjective 'remember' judgments. In the Encoding group, MDMA reduced recollection estimates for negative and positive pictures but had little to no effect on neutral items or familiarity estimates. There was evidence for similar trends in the Retrieval group. These findings indicate that MDMA attenuates the encoding and retrieval of salient details from emotional events, consistent with the idea that its potential therapeutic effects for treating posttraumatic stress disorder are related to altering emotional memory."
"5239","1","Clozapine blunts N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist-induced psychosis: a study with ketamine.^\nSeveral lines of evidence suggest that the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor is involved in the antipsychotic efficacy of the atypical antipsychotic agent clozapine. Clinical data on the interaction between clozapine's mechanism of action and NMDA receptor function have been lacking secondary to a paucity of pharmacologic probes of the NMDA system. We have utilized a double-blind, placebo-controlled infusion paradigm with subanesthetic doses of the NMDA antagonist ketamine to test the hypothesis that clozapine would blunt ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms in schizophrenic patients. Ten schizophrenic patients underwent ketamine infusions while antipsychotic drug free and also during treatment with clozapine. Antipsychotic drug-free patients experienced increases in ratings of positive and negative symptoms. Clozapine treatment significantly blunted the ketamine-induced increase in positive symptoms. These data suggest that NMDA receptor function may be involved in the unique antipsychotic efficacy of clozapine."
"9231","0","Rapid-acting antidepressants.^\nConventional antidepressants (biogenic amine mechanisms) are not fully efficacious (e.g., symptoms remain after treatment, not all patients respond), produce effects only after weeks of daily dosing, and do not impact all disease symptoms. In contrast, a new class of antidepressants has been emerging since 2006 that has demonstrated rapid onset, large effect size, activity after only a single or few dose applications, and positive impact in treatment refractory patients and against some treatment-resistant symptoms (e.g., anhedonia). Rapid-acting antidepressant drug action has been demonstrated in controlled clinical studies for ketamine, a few other NMDA receptor antagonists, and scopolamine. Less clinical data are currently available for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide, and ayahuasca. The mechanisms of action of rapid-acting antidepressants are not fully understood. However, a general triggering mechanism appears to involve the potentiation of AMPA receptor function. Although the durability of antidepressant effects of ketamine and scopolamine is limited, psychedelic drugs have been reported to produce effects for many months. The primary impediment to generating a medicine of this type for depressed patients is side effects and the lack of methods to ensure enduring antidepressant effects. Thus, further exploration of drug possibilities continues. Esketamine ((S)-ketamine) was recently FDA approved. Compounds currently in clinical development include the NMDA receptor antagonist (R)-ketamine, the NMDA receptor modulator, GLYX-13 (Rapastinel), and the AMPA receptor potentiator TAK-653. Additional pharmacological classes have produced effects in the preclinical laboratory to suggest their potential as rapid-acting agents. These include mGlu2/3 receptor antagonists, AMPA receptor potentiators, and negative allosteric modulators of GABA(A)(α5) receptors. In all cases, molecules exist that could be used to provide clinical proof of concept testing."
"2914","1","Are ecstasy users biased toward endorsing somatic mental health symptoms? Results from a general community sample.^\nRationale: Whether the reported poorer mental health of ecstasy users is due to a bias in endorsement of somatic symptoms has been postulated, but rarely examined. Objectives: The purpose of this study is to investigate whether levels of ecstasy use were associated with differential probabilities of endorsing somatic mental health symptoms. Methods: Current ecstasy users aged 24-30 years (n∈=∈316) were identified from a population-based Australian study. Measures included frequency of ecstasy, meth/amphetamine, and cannabis use and the Goldberg anxiety/depression symptom scales. Results: Multiple indicator, multiple cause models demonstrated no bias towards endorsing somatic symptoms with higher ecstasy use, both with and without adjustment for gender, cannabis, and meth/amphetamine use. Conclusions: Other studies using alternate measures of mental health should adopt this approach to determine if there is a bias in the endorsement of somatic symptoms among ecstasy users. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
"6891","1","Cognitive impairment after small-dose ketamine isomers in comparison to equianalgesic racemic ketamine in human volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is increasingly used in pain therapy but may impair brain functions. Mood and cognitive capacities were compared after equianalgesic small-dose S(+)-, R(-)-, and racemic ketamine in healthy volunteers. METHODS: Twenty-four subjects received intravenous 0.5 mg/kg racemic, 0.25 mg/kg S(+)-, and 1.0 mg/kg R(-)-ketamine in a prospective, randomized, double-blind, crossover study. Hemodynamic variables, mood, and cognitive capacities were assessed for 60 min. RESULTS: Transient increases in blood pressure, heart rate, and catecholamines were similar after administration of all drugs. At 20 min after injection, subjects felt less decline in concentration and were more brave after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. They reported being less lethargic but more out-of-control after R(-)- than racemic ketamine. Ketamine isomers induced less drowsiness, less lethargy, and less impairment in clustered subjective cognitive capacity than racemic ketamine for the 60-min study. Objective concentration capacity [test time, S(+): 25.4 +/- 15.2 s, R(-): 34.8 +/- 18.4 s, racemic ketamine: 40.8 +/- 20.8 s, mean +/- SD] and retention in primary memory [test time, S(+): 4.6 +/- 1.2 s, R(-): 4.2 +/- 1.4 s, racemic ketamine: 4.0 +/- 1.4 s, mean +/- SD] declined less after S(+)- than either R(-)- or racemic ketamine at 1 min. At 5 min, immediate recall, anterograde amnesia, retention in primary memory, short-term storage capacity, and intelligence quotient were less reduced after the isomers than racemic ketamine. Speed reading and central information flow decreased less after S(+)- than racemic ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Early after injection, ketamine isomers induce less tiredness and cognitive impairment than equianalgesic small-dose racemic ketamine. In addition, S(+)-ketamine causes less decline in concentration capacity and primary memory. The differences in drug effects cannot be explained by stereoselective action on one given receptor."
"5742","0","Later is not necessarily better: limitations of survival analysis in studies of long-term drug treatment of psychiatric conditions.^\nSurvival analysis is routinely used to assess differences between groups in relapse prevention and treatment discontinuation studies involving people with long-term psychiatric conditions. The actual outcome in survival analysis is 'time to event', yet, in the mental health field, there has been little consideration of whether a temporary delay to relapse is clinically relevant in a condition that can last for decades. Moreover, in psychiatric drug trials, a pattern of elevated early relapses following randomisation to placebo or no treatment is common. This may be the result of the withdrawal of previous treatment leading to physiological withdrawal effects, which may be mistaken for relapse, or genuine relapse precipitated by the process of withdrawal. Such withdrawal effects typically produce converging survival curves eventually. They inevitably lead to differences in time to relapse, even when there is little or no difference in the cumulative risk of relapse at final follow-up. Therefore, statistical tests based on survival analyses can be misleading because they obscure these withdrawal effects. We illustrate these difficulties in a trial of antipsychotic reduction versus maintenance, and a trial of prophylactic esketamine in people with treatment-resistant depression. Both illustrate withdrawal-related effects that underline the importance of long-term follow-up and question the use of tests based on time to event. Further discussion of the most relevant outcome and appropriate approach to analysis, and research on patient and carer preferences is important to inform the design of future trials and interpretation of existing ones."
"7521","1","Psilocybin administration to healthy participants: safety and feasibility in a placebo-controlled study.^\nBackground: Treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) remains a significant unmet medical need. From an antidepressant drug development perspective, interest has in recent years been directed at compounds with known pharmacology. Psilocybin belongs to a class of drugs referred to as psychedelics ('mindmanifesting'). Psilocybin was isolated from psilocybe mushrooms in 1957 and synthesised in 1958. It is believed that partial agonism at 5HT2A receptors is a key contributor to its biological effects. The compound was used in psychiatric research and psychodynamic orientated psychotherapy from the early 1960s until it became a Schedule 1 substance in the USA in 1970. In recent years, several small studies have shown indications of efficacy of psilocybin in depressive states related to cancer and in TRD. Psilocybin is now in clinical development for TRD in the USA, Canada and Europe. The first study in this clinical development program, reported here, evaluated safety and feasibility in healthy participants. It also explored simultaneous administration of psilocybin in healthy participants and facilitated experiential training of specialised therapists for subsequent studies. The study's primary objective was to assess the short‐term effects of psilocybin on emotional processing and cognitive function at Days 7 and 28; these results will be presented later, once all the data has been analysed. Methods: This was a phase 1, randomised, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study to evaluate the effects of 10 mg and 25 mg psilocybin as compared to placebo, in healthy participants, conducted at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, London, UK. The following assessment tools were administered: Tellegen Absorption Scale (TAS), NEO‐Five Factor Inventory (NEO‐FFI), Symptom Checklist‐90 item (SCL‐90), Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), Pictorial Empathy Test (PET), Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET), Social Value Orientation (SVO), Toronto Empathy Questionnaire (TEQ), Scale of Social Responsibility (SSR), Spatial Working Memory (SWM), Rapid Visual Information Processing (RVP), Paired Associates Learning (PAL). Results from these instruments will be presented later. The study planned to recruit 90 participants, aged 18 plus, with no prior psilocybin experience within 1 year of enrolment. Participants were enrolled in the study for 12 weeks following study drug administration. They completed baseline assessments 1 day prior to study drug administration, including assessments of emotional processing and cognitive function. During this visit, they also took part in a 2‐hour preparatory group session with the study psychiatrist, lead therapist and chaperones. On Day 0, participants stratified by sex and age (18‐35 years old; > 35 years old) were randomised to the study drug (placebo, 10 mg psilocybin, or 25 mg psilocybin, administered orally, in a 1:1:1 ratio.). The sessions lasted approximately 6 hours and were supported by a trained chaperone and were supervised by the study psychiatrist and a lead therapist. The study drug could be administered simultaneously to up to 6 participants. All participants were assessed for safety and asked to complete the PANAS and 5D‐Altered States of Consciousness questionnaire (5D‐ASC). After the acute effects of study drug administration had subsided, participants returned home, coming back to the clinic the next morning for safety assessments and a discussion about the subjective experience during the session, conducted by study therapists. Results: 89 participants were recruited, with first participant first visit date 17 August 2018 and last participant last visit date 19 July 2019. Four strata were populated, (males 18‐35) n = 24; (males 35+) n = 24; (females 18‐35) n = 23; (females 35+) n = 18. 38% of the participants had prior psilocybin experience. A total of 25 dosing sessions were completed, with up to 6 participants per session (2 sessions with 1 participant, 3 with 2 participants, 5 with 3 participants, 11 with 4, 2 with 5, and, 2 ith 6). In the simultaneous administration sessions, each participant was supported by an assisting therapist, overseen in the treatment room by a lead therapist. During this study, 46 therapists received experiential training for subsequent studies. Psilocybin induced expected transient psychedelic experiences. The drug was well tolerated and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusions: This study demonstrated the safety and feasibility of psilocybin administration to healthy participants in a controlled setting with trained therapists. Additionally, simultaneous administration to up to 6 volunteers was shown to be feasible in this population."
"2169","0","A cross-sectional survey on cannabis: Characterizing motives, opinions, and subjective experiences associated with the use of various oral cannabis products.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis-infused products available for oral consumption include food and drink items (i.e., edibles) (e.g., baked goods, gummy-, chocolate-, and hard-candies, beverages/drinks) as well as non-food formulations (e.g., oils/tinctures, pills/capsules). This study characterized the motives, opinions, and subjective experiences associated with the use of these seven subtypes of oral cannabis products. METHODS: This web-based survey collected cross-sectional, self-report data from a convenience sample of 370 adults regarding various use-motives, self-reported cannabinoid content, subjective experiences, and opinions related to ingesting oral cannabis products with alcohol and/or food. Advice participants had received about modifying oral cannabis product effects, in general, was also collected. RESULTS: Participants reported consuming cannabis baked goods and gummy candies most frequently over the past year (68% and 63%, respectively). Participants were less likely to use oils/tinctures for enjoyment/desire relative to other product types and more likely to use oils/tinctures for therapeutic purposes (e.g., medication-replacement). Self-reported cannabinoid content was highly variable across participants and within product subtype. Participants reported feeling stronger and longer-lasting effects when consuming oral cannabis products on an empty stomach and 43% received advice to ""eat a snack or meal"" to mitigate effects that are too strong, which contrasts with controlled studies. Finally, 43% of participants reported modifying their experiences with alcohol at least some of time. CONCLUSIONS: These findings underscore the need to further evaluate use-motives as well as the interaction between dietary factors, cannabinoid pharmacokinetics, and subjective drug effects and the interactive effects of oral cannabis products and alcohol in a controlled laboratory setting."
"3619","1","Urinary catecholamine excretion following lysergic acid diethylamide in man.^\nTwo separate controlled experiments in man measured the excretion of epinephrine, norepinephrine, vanilmandelic acid (VMA) and total metanephrines following lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), comparisons being made with an injection of a similar dose of epinephrine in the one instance and with a no-treament period in the other. LSD (2 mcg/kg) produced insignificant changes in urinary catecholamine excretion over a four-hour period while epinephrine (3 mcg/kg) evoked substantial increases in excretion of epinephrine, VMA and metanephrines with a concomitant decrease in norepinephrine excretion. Sympathomimetic effects of these doses of LSD were apparent clinically and as judged by the degree of elevation of plasma free fatty acids (FFA); the response to epinephrine was brief and intense, while that to LSD was sustained and more gradual in onset. In the second experiment, LSD (1.5 and 2 mcg/kg) produced no more changes in catecholamine excretion over an eight-hour period than a control no-treatment trial. Although LSD has many sympathomimetic actions, these are not adequately reflected by measurement of urinary catecholamine excretion. These experiments suggest that measurement of urinary catecholamines is a poor gauge of sustained sympathomimetic effects. © 1967 Springer-Verlag."
"3126","1","Hallucinogen use is associated with mental health and addictive problems and impulsivity in university students.^\nBackground: This study examined the prevalence of hallucinogen use in a large sample of university students and its associations with mental health issues. Methods: 9449 students received a 156-item anonymous online survey, which assessed the use of hallucinogens (ever or past year), alcohol and drug use, mental health issues, and impulsive and compulsive traits. Group differences were characterized using statistical tests (p values reported uncorrected, but only regarded as significant if surviving Bonferroni correction). Results: 3525 university students (57.7% female) responded to the survey. The prevalence of past 12-month hallucinogen use in the sample was 4.7%, with an additional 6.4% reporting having used more than 12 months ago. Hallucinogen use was associated with the use of multiple other drugs (e.g., alcohol, opiates) (each p < 0.001), mental health problems (p < 0.001), risky sexual behavior (p < 0.001), low self-esteem (p = 0.004), and impulsivity traits (p < 0.001) but not compulsivity. Effect sizes were small to medium. Conclusion: Past use of hallucinogens was reported in 11.1%, and was associated with a variety of mental health and drug use problems. Clinicians should be aware that use of hallucinogens is common and mental health problems are more likely in those who use hallucinogens. This study indicates the need for longitudinal research into the negative effects of hallucinogen use on brain function and mental health, especially in young people. Such research should address the extent to which impulsive traits predispose to various substance use problems, versus the direct effects of hallucinogens (and other substances) on mental health."
"5804","1","Greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine in males.^\nRATIONALE: Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function."
"2151","1","Antidepressive and anxiolytic effects of ayahuasca: A systematic literature review of animal and human studies.^\nObjective: To conduct a systematic literature review of animal and human studies reporting anxiolytic or antidepressive effects of ayahuasca or some of its isolated alkaloids (dimethyltryptamine, harmine, tetrahydroharmine, and harmaline). Methods: Papers published until 3 April 2015 were retrieved from the PubMed, LILACS and SciELO databases following a comprehensive search strategy and using a predetermined set of criteria for article selection. Results: Five hundred and fourteen studies were identified, of which 21 met the established criteria. Studies in animals have shown anxiolytic and antidepressive effects of ayahuasca, harmine, and harmaline, and experimental studies in humans and mental health assessments of experienced ayahuasca consumers also suggest that ayahuasca is associated with reductions in anxiety and depressive symptoms. A pilot study reported rapid antidepressive effects of a single ayahuasca dose in six patients with recurrent depression. Conclusion: Considering the need for new drugs that produce fewer adverse effects and are more effective in reducing anxiety and depression symptomatology, the described effects of ayahuasca and its alkaloids should be further investigated."
"3269","0","Oral ketamine preanesthetic medication in children.^\nThe authors sought to define a dose of oral ketamine that would facilitate induction of anesthesia without causing significant side effects. Forty-five children (ASA Physical Status 1 and 2; aged 1-7 yr) were assigned randomly in a prospective, double-blind fashion to three separate groups that received either 3 mg/kg, 6 mg/kg, or no ketamine mixed in 0.2 ml/kg cola-flavored soft drink. They also were evaluated preoperatively and postoperatively for acceptance of oral ketamine as a premedicant, reaction to separation from parents, emotional state, and emergence phenomena. The authors detected no episodes of respiratory depression, tachycardia, or arterial hemoglobin desaturation before, during, or after surgery. The 6 mg/kg dose was well accepted; provided uniform, predictable sedation within 20-25 min; and allowed calm separation from parents and good induction conditions. The 3 mg/kg dose did not always cause sedation and calm separation from parents. Neither dose of ketamine increased the incidence of laryngospasm, prolonged recovery times, or caused emergence phenomena. The authors conclude that an oral dose of 6 mg/kg ketamine is easily administered and well accepted in young children and provides predictable, satisfactory premedication without significant side effects."
"7822","1","A proof-of-principle study of the short-term effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on tinnitus and neural connectivity.^\nBackground: This study was conducted to investigate the short-term behavioural and neurophysiological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) on tinnitus perception.Methods: A double-blind randomized controlled cross-over design. Part 1. Behavioural measures of tinnitus following 30 mg MDMA or placebo administration (N = 5 participants) and Part 2. Behavioural measures of tinnitus and correlations between pairs of apriori regions of interest (ROI) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) before and after 70 mg of MDMA or placebo (N = 8 participants).Results: The results to MDMA were similar to placebo. For the 70 mg dose, there was a significant reduction after 4 h in annoyance and ignore ratings. RsMRI showed decreased connectivity compared with placebo administration between the left hippocampal, right hippocampal, left amygdala and right amygdala regions, and between the right posterior parahippocampal cortex and the left amygdala after two hours of 70 mg MDMA administration. Increased connectivity compared to placebo administration was found post MDMA between the right post-central gyrus and right posterior and superior temporal gyrus, and between the thalamus and frontoparietal network.Conclusions: Following 70 mg of MDMA two tinnitus rating scales significantly improved. There was, however, a placebo effect. Compared with placebo the rsMRI following the MDMA showed reductions in connectivity between the amygdala, hippocampus and parahippocampal gyrus. There is sufficient proof of concept to support future investigation of MDMA as a treatment for tinnitus."
"7598","1","Time to relapse after a single administration of intravenous ketamine augmentation in unipolar treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To examine the rate and time to relapse for remitters and responders to ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were randomized to a single infusion of one of several doses of intravenous ketamine, or midazolam. Using Kaplan-Meier survival function, the current report examines the rate and time to relapse, defined as MADRS ≥ 22, over a period of 30 days, in subjects who achieved remission (MADRS ≤ 10) or response (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS) on day three post-infusion of intravenous ketamine 0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg. RESULTS: Of the 60 randomized participants who received a single ketamine (0.1, 0.5, or 1.0 mg/kg) infusion, 19 (34%) met criteria for remission and 27 (48%) for response, on day 3 post-infusion. A numerical dose-response relationship was observed, with remitters/responders on ketamine 1.0 mg/kg having the lowest relapse rate, followed by ketamine 0.5 mg/kg and 0.1 mg/kg, respectively (% of remitters who relapsed by day 14: 38% with 1.0 mg/kg, 50% with 0.5 mg/kg, 100% with 0.1 mg/kg;% of responders who relapsed by day 14: 30% with 1.0 mg/kg, 50% with 0.5 mg/kg, 80% with 0.1 mg/kg). LIMITATIONS: The sample size was small. No MADRS measurements at day one post-infusion. The study was not powered to assess differences in relapse prevention between different doses of ketamine. CONCLUSION: Time to relapse after successful treatment with a single infusion of ketamine appears to follow a dose-response relationship, where higher dosage leads to increased time to relapse."
"2483","1","Semantic activation in LSD: evidence from picture naming.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is a classic psychedelic drug that alters cognition in a characteristic way. It has been suggested that psychedelics expand the breadth of cognition via actions on the central nervous system. Previous work has shown changes in semantic processing under psilocybin (a related psychedelic to LSD) that are consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation. The present study investigates this further using a picture-naming task and the psychedelic, LSD. Ten participants completed the task under placebo and LSD. Results revealed significant effects of LSD on accuracy and error correction that were consistent with an increased spread of semantic activation under LSD. These results are consistent with a generalised “entropic” effect on the mind. We suggest incorporating direct neuroimaging measures in future studies, and to employ more naturalistic measures of semantic processing that may enhance ecological validity."
"8679","1","Prospective examination of synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine inhalation: effects on salivary IL-6, cortisol levels, affect, and non-judgment.^\nRATIONALE: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is a psychotropic substance found in various plant and animal species and is synthetically produced. 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine is used in naturalistic settings for spiritual exploration, recreation, or to address negative affect and mood problems. However, scientific knowledge on the effects of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans is scarce. OBJECTIVES: The first objective was to assess the effects of inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine on neuroendocrine markers. The second objective was to assess effects of the substance on affect and mindfulness. In addition, we assessed whether ratings of subjective measures were associated with changes in stress biomarkers (i.e., cortisol) and immune response (i.e., IL-6, CRP, IL-1β), as well as the acute psychedelic experience. METHODS: Assessments (baseline, immediately post-session, and 7-day follow-up) were made in 11 participants. Salivary samples were collected at baseline and post-session and analyzed by high-sensitivity enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). RESULTS: 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine significantly increased cortisol levels and decreased IL-6 concentrations in saliva immediately post-session. These changes were not correlated to ratings of mental health or the psychedelic experience. Relative to baseline, ratings of non-judgment significantly increased, and ratings of depression decreased immediately post-session and at follow-up. Ratings of anxiety and stress decreased from baseline to 7-day follow-up. Participant ratings of the psychedelic experience correlated negatively with ratings of affect and positively with ratings of non-judgment. CONCLUSION: Inhalation of vaporized synthetic 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine produced significant changes in inflammatory markers, improved affect, and non-judgment in volunteers. Future research should examine the effect of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamineamine with healthy volunteers in a controlled laboratory setting."

"5446","1","A proof-of-concept investigation into ketamine as a pharmacological treatment for alcohol dependence: study protocol for a randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Worldwide, alcohol abuse is a burgeoning problem. Abstinence is key to allow recovery of physical and mental health as well as quality of life, but treatment for alcohol dependence is associated with high relapse rates. Preliminary data have suggested that a combined repeated ketamine and psychological therapy programme may be effective in reducing relapse in severe alcohol use disorder. This non-commercial proof-of-concept trial is aimed at making a preliminary assessment of the effectiveness of this combined treatment in this patient group. METHODS/DESIGN: This is a phase II, randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group clinical trial taking place in two sites in the UK: the South West of England and London. Ninety-six recently detoxified alcoholics, with comorbid depressive symptoms, will be randomised to one of four treatment arms. Patients will receive either three sessions of ketamine (0.8 mg/kg administered intravenously (IV) over 40 minutes) or placebo (50 ml saline 0.9% IV over 40 minutes) plus either seven sessions of manualised psychological therapy or an alcohol education control. Patients will be assessed at 3 and 6 months on a range of psychological and biological variables. The primary endpoints are (1) relapse rates at 6 months and (2) percentage days abstinent at 6 months. Secondary endpoints include 3 and 6 month percentage days abstinence, tolerability (indicated by dropout), adverse events, depressive symptoms, craving and quality of life. DISCUSSION: This study will provide important information on a new combined psychological and pharmacological intervention aimed at reducing relapse rates in alcoholics. The findings would have broad application given the worldwide prevalence of alcoholism and its associated medical, psychological and social problems.

"2026","1","Ketamine, lidocaine and combination for postoperative analgesia in liver resection: a randomized controlled trial.^\nIntroduction: Abdominal wall incisions used for liver surgeries are associated with significant postoperative pain and disability. Epidural analgesia is considered the gold standard for major abdominal surgery and is shown to have superior analgesia when compared to systemic analgesia[i]. However, its use is controversial[ii]. Lidocaine and ketamine both are being used for perioperative analgesia. Perioperative lidocaine infusion has been shown to reduce postoperative pain and opioid consumption[iii]. Perioperative low dose Ketamine has shown improved postoperative pain and reduced opioid usage[iv]. , therefore,re tested the hypothesis that the combination would provide better analgesia in the milieu of intrathecal morphine. Methods: After institutional ethics approval and written informed consent, we randomized 124 adult ASA 1‐4 patients scheduled for open liver resection to one of four groups. Intraoperatively, group L received lidocaine infusion, group K received ketamine infusion, group LK received lidocaine and ketamine infusion and group P received saline infusion. All patients received 300 mics intrathecal morphine prior to induction of standardized anesthesia and all infusions were started immediately after the intubation and continued until the end of surgery. Postoperatively, all patients received hydromorphone via a PCA device and its consumption recorded for 3 days. Data regarding other side effects was also recorded. Primary outcome measurements included pain scores and opioid consumption at 24 hrs. Secondary outcomes included pain scores and opioid consumption at 48 and 72 hrs and side effects including nausea, vomiting, dizziness, hallucinations, headaches and signs of local anesthetic toxicity. Patients were followed up for 12 weeks. Results: Data analysis included 113 patients. There was no difference in pain scores within all 4 groups at rest or movement at 24 hrs. Mean 48 hrs rest pain scores were 3.1, 1.7, 2.3 and 1.7 in L, K, KL and P groups respectively (p<0.03 between groups, unadjusted for multiple testing procedures). Pain scores were not significantly different at all other time points. All opioids were converted to morphine equivalents. Opioid use was less in ketamine group at 48 hrs but did not reach statistical significance. The total 72 hr use was not significantly different across the groups. There was no difference in side effects between the groups at any time points. Conclusions: In this triple blind, parallel group four‐arm placebo controlled randomized controlled trial, lidocaine, ketamine or their combination did not add any benefit over single dose intrathecal morphine with patient controlled hydromorphone analgesia. There was a trend towards better analgesia at 48 hrs with ketamine alone but reduction in opioid use was not significant."
"7230","1","Serotonergic hallucinogens in the treatment of anxiety and depression in patients suffering from a life-threatening disease: A systematic review.^\nAnxiety and depression are some of the most common psychiatric symptoms of patients suffering with life-threatening diseases, often associated with a low quality of life and a poor overall prognosis. 5-HT(2A)-receptor agonists (serotonergic hallucinogens, 'psychedelics') like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin were first investigated as therapeutic agents in the 1960s. Recently, after a long hiatus period of regulatory obstacles, interest in the clinical use of these substances has resumed. The current article provides a systematic review of studies investigating psychedelics in the treatment of symptoms of existential distress in life-threatening diseases across different periods of research, highlighting how underlying concepts have developed over time. A systematic search for clinical trials from 1960 to 2017 revealed 11 eligible clinical trials involving a total number of N=445 participants, of which 7 trials investigated the use of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) (N=323), 3 trials investigated the use of psilocybin (N=92), and one trial investigated the use of dipropyltryptamine (DPT) (N=30). The 4 more recent randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (N=104) showed a significantly higher methodological quality than studies carried out in the 1960s and 1970s. Evidence supports that patients with life threatening diseases associated with symptoms of depression and anxiety benefit from the anxiolytic and antidepressant properties of serotonergic hallucinogens. Some studies anecdotally reported improvements in patients´ quality of life and reduced fear of death. Moreover, low rates of side effects were reported in studies that adhered to safety guidelines. Further studies are needed to determine how these results can be transferred into clinical practice."
"1882","1","Acute cognitive effects of single-dose intravenous ketamine in major depressive and posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nIntravenous (IV) subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been shown to reduce psychiatric distress in both major depressive (MDD) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). However, the effect of ketamine on cognitive function in these disorders is not well understood. To address this gap, we examined the effect of a single dose of IV ketamine on cognition in individuals with MDD and/or PTSD relative to healthy controls (HC). Psychiatric (n = 29; 15 PTSD, 14 MDD) and sex- age- and IQ matched HC (n = 29) groups were recruited from the community. A single subanesthetic dose of IV ketamine was administered. Mood and cognitive measures were collected prior to, 2 h and 1 day post-ketamine administration. MDD/PTSD individuals evidenced a large-magnitude improvement in severity of depressive symptoms at both 2-hours and 1 day post-ketamine administration (p’s <.001, Cohen d’s = 0.80–1.02). Controlling for baseline performance and years of education, IV ketamine induced declines in attention (ATTN), executive function (EF), and verbal memory (VM) 2 h post-administration, all of which had resolved by 1 day post-ketamine across groups. The magnitude of cognitive decline was significantly larger in MDD/PTSD relative to HC on attention only (p =.012, d = 0.56). Ketamine did not affect working memory (WM) performance. Cognitive function (baseline, change from baseline to post-ketamine) was not associated with antidepressant response to ketamine. Results suggest that while ketamine may have an acute deleterious effect on some cognitive domains in both MDD/PTSD and HC individuals, most notably attention, this reduction is transient and there is no evidence of ketamine-related cognitive dysfunction at 1 day post-administration."
"8320","1","Dose-response study of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans. II. Subjective effects and preliminary results of a new rating scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Validation of animal models of hallucinogenic drugs' subjective effects requires human data. Previous human studies used varied groups of subjects and assessment methods. Rating scales for hallucinogen effects emphasized psychodynamic principles or the drugs' dysphoric properties. We describe the subjective effects of graded doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), an endogenous hallucinogen and drug of abuse, in a group of experienced hallucinogen users. We also present preliminary data from a new rating scale for these effects. METHODS: Twelve highly motivated volunteers received two doses (0.04 and 0.4 mg/kg) of intravenous (IV) dimethyltryptamine fumarate ""nonblind,"" before entering a double-blind, saline placebo-controlled, randomized study using four doses of IV DMT. Subjects were carefully interviewed after resolution of drug effects, providing thorough and systematic descriptions of DMT's effects. They also were administered a new instrument, the Hallucinogen Rating Scale (HRS). The HRS was drafted from interviews obtained from an independent sample of 19 experienced DMT users, and modified during early stages of the study. RESULTS: Psychological effects of IV DMT began almost immediately after administration, peaked at 90 to 120 seconds, and were almost completely resolved by 30 minutes. This time course paralleled DMT blood levels previously described. Hallucinogenic effects were seen after 0.2 and 0.4 mg/kg of dimethyltryptamine fumarate, and included a rapidly moving, brightly colored visual display of images. Auditory effects were less common. ""Loss of control,"" associated with a brief, but overwhelming ""rush,"" led to a dissociated state, where euphoria alternated or coexisted with anxiety. These effects completely replaced subjects' previously ongoing mental experience and were more vivid and compelling than dreams or waking awareness. Lower doses, 0.1 and 0.05 mg/kg, were primarily affective and somaesthetic, while 0.1 mg/kg elicited the least desirable effects. Clustering of HRS items, using either a clinical, mental status method or principal components factor analysis provided better resolution of dose effects than did the biological variables described previously. CONCLUSIONS: These clinical and preliminary quantitative data provide bases for further psychopharmacologic characterization of DMT's properties in humans. They also may be used to compare the effects of other agents affecting relevant brain receptors in volunteer and psychiatric populations."
"8335","1","Psilocybin with psychological support improves emotional face recognition in treatment-resistant depression.^\nRATIONALE: Depressed patients robustly exhibit affective biases in emotional processing which are altered by SSRIs and predict clinical outcome. OBJECTIVES: The objective of this study is to investigate whether psilocybin, recently shown to rapidly improve mood in treatment-resistant depression (TRD), alters patients' emotional processing biases. METHODS: Seventeen patients with treatment-resistant depression completed a dynamic emotional face recognition task at baseline and 1 month later after two doses of psilocybin with psychological support. Sixteen controls completed the emotional recognition task over the same time frame but did not receive psilocybin. RESULTS: We found evidence for a group × time interaction on speed of emotion recognition (p = .035). At baseline, patients were slower at recognising facial emotions compared with controls (p < .001). After psilocybin, this difference was remediated (p = .208). Emotion recognition was faster at follow-up compared with baseline in patients (p = .004, d = .876) but not controls (p = .263, d = .302). In patients, this change was significantly correlated with a reduction in anhedonia over the same time period (r = .640, p = .010). CONCLUSIONS: Psilocybin with psychological support appears to improve processing of emotional faces in treatment-resistant depression, and this correlates with reduced anhedonia. Placebo-controlled studies are warranted to follow up these preliminary findings."
"8342","1","Prediction of psilocybin response in healthy volunteers.^\nResponses to hallucinogenic drugs, such as psilocybin, are believed to be critically dependent on the user's personality, current mood state, drug pre-experiences, expectancies, and social and environmental variables. However, little is known about the order of importance of these variables and their effect sizes in comparison to drug dose. Hence, this study investigated the effects of 24 predictor variables, including age, sex, education, personality traits, drug pre-experience, mental state before drug intake, experimental setting, and drug dose on the acute response to psilocybin. The analysis was based on the pooled data of 23 controlled experimental studies involving 409 psilocybin administrations to 261 healthy volunteers. Multiple linear mixed effects models were fitted for each of 15 response variables. Although drug dose was clearly the most important predictor for all measured response variables, several non-pharmacological variables significantly contributed to the effects of psilocybin. Specifically, having a high score in the personality trait of Absorption, being in an emotionally excitable and active state immediately before drug intake, and having experienced few psychological problems in past weeks were most strongly associated with pleasant and mystical-type experiences, whereas high Emotional Excitability, low age, and an experimental setting involving positron emission tomography most strongly predicted unpleasant and/or anxious reactions to psilocybin. The results confirm that non-pharmacological variables play an important role in the effects of psilocybin."
"2736","1","Reduction of psychotomimetic side effects of Ketalar (ketamine) by Rohypnol (flunitrazepam). A randomized, double-blind trial.^\nA double-blind controlled trial based on 140 women undergoing abortus provocatus was employed to study whether the frequency of side effects after administration of the anaesthetic Ketalar (ketamine) could be reduced by a con-current dose of Rohypnol (flunitrazepam). The control group was given ketamine alone. The dosage of ketamine was 2 mg/kg body weight, supplemented if necessary by 1 mg/kg, in combination with either 2 mg flunitrazepam or placebo. No other anaesthetics were used. On several counts, the combination of ketamine and flunitrazepam was proved to reduce the adverse reactions seen with ketamine alone. Motor restlessness and confusion in the awakening state occurred with significantly less severity and frequency. Amnesia for dreams was significantly more frequent. Memory of dreams was often unpleasant after ketamine alone. The influence on pulse rate was significantly smaller and no significant changes in systolic blood pressure were seen, whereas a significant increase occurred with ketamine alone. Less pronounced fluctuations in diastolic blood pressure occurred with the combination ketamine-flunitrazepam. Respiratory rate increased significantly with both treatments, but respiratory minute volume was lower with the ketamine-flunitrazepam combination. A double-blind comparison of ketamine (Ketalar) and ketamine with flunitrazepam (Rohypnol) for anesthesia in 136 abortions was conducted to see whether the combination would reduce the psychomimetic side effects of ketamine. Doses were ketamine 2 mg/kg body weight iv, mixed with 2 mg flunitrazepam or a placebo, and 1 mg/kg ketamine repeated if needed. The side effects significantly reduced were: motor restlessness, confusion requiring sedatives, dreams and nightmares, systolic and diastolic hypertension, tachycardia, and increase in respiratory rate and in respiratory minute volume. Those given ketamine alone required significantly more repeat injections. eng"

Seventeen female and male participants (black, white, and Hispanic) received placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), and high (1.6 mg/kg) oral MDMA doses (comparable to recreational doses) in a double-blind, randomized, balanced, within-subject design while residing on a closed research unit. Doses were separated by 1 week or more. A fully validated two-dimensional gas chromatography/mass spectrometry method simultaneously quantified MDMA, HMMA, MDA, and HMA. Calibration curves were MDA, 1 to 100 ng/mL; HMA, 2.5 to 100 ng/mL; and MDMA and HMMA, 2.5 to 400 ng/mL. Mean +/- standard deviation maximum plasma concentrations (C(max)) of 162.9 +/- 39.8 and 171.9 +/- 79.5 ng/mL were observed for MDMA and HMMA, respectively, after low-dose MDMA. After the high dose, mean MDMA Cmax significantly increased to 291.8 +/- 76.5 ng/mL, whereas mean HMMA C(max) was unchanged at 173.5 +/- 66.3 ng/mL. High intersubject variability in C(max) was observed. Mean MDA C(max) were 8.4 +/- 2.1 (low) and 13.8 +/- 3.8 (high) ng/mL. HMA Cmax were 3.5 +/- 0.4 and 3.9 +/- 0.9 ng/mL after the low and high doses, respectively. AUC infinity displayed similar trends to C(max), demonstrating nonlinear pharmacokinetics. Times of last plasma detection were generally HMA < MDA < MDMA < HMMA. Mean half-lives (t1/2) of MDMA, MDA, and HMMA were approximately 7 to 8 hours, 10.5 to 12.5 hours, and 11.5 to 13.5 hours, respectively. HMA t1/2 showed high variability. Mean MDMA volume of distribution was constant for low and high doses; clearance was significantly higher after the low dose. This study presents MDMA plasma pharmacokinetic data for the first time from blacks and females as well as measurement of HMMA and HMA concentrations after low and high MDMA doses and more frequent and extended plasma sampling than in prior studies."
"6530","0","An observational study of safety and clinical outcome measures across patient groups in the United Kingdom Medical Cannabis Registry.^\nBACKGROUND: There is a paucity of high-quality data on patient outcomes and safety after initiating treatment with cannabis-based medicinal products (CBMPs). The aim of this study was to assess the clinical outcomes and safety of CBMPs by analyzing patient-reported outcome measures and adverse events across a broad spectrum of chronic conditions. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This study analyzed patients enrolled in the UK Medical Cannabis Registry. Participants completed the EQ-5D-5L to assess health-related quality of life, Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 (GAD-7) questionnaire to measure anxiety severity, and the Single-item Sleep Quality Scale (SQS) to rate sleep quality at baseline and follow-up after 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. RESULTS: A total of 2833 participants met inclusion criteria. The EQ-5D-5L index value, GAD-7, and SQS all improved at each follow-up (p < 0.001). There was no difference in EQ-5D-5L index values between former or current illicit cannabis consumers and naïve patients (p > 0.050). Adverse events were reported by 474 (16.73%) participants. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that CBMPs are associated with an improvement in health-related quality of life in UK patients with chronic diseases. Treatment was tolerated well by most participants, but adverse events were more common in female and cannabis-naïve patients."
"9037","1","Verbal working memory deficits in current and previous users of MDMA.^\nPrevious research suggests that MDMA users are impaired in various aspects of cognitive functioning, however, it remains unclear whether they might experience deficits in established measures of verbal working memory functioning. In the present study current and previous MDMA users were compared with non-users on verbal working memory measures including reading and computation span. Both user groups were found to be impaired on the computation span measure while current users also exhibited impairment in reading span. The MDMA-related deficit on the computation span measure remained significant following the introduction of statistical controls for the potentially confounding effects of cannabis and other drugs. The results are discussed in the context of recent research on executive processes. It is suggested that MDMA may produce differential effects on specific components within a fractionated executive system. Copyright © 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"2807","1","Prospective memory deficits in illicit polydrug users are associated with the average long-term typical dose of ecstasy typically consumed in a single session.^\nRationale: Neuroimaging evidence suggests that ecstasy-related reductions in SERT densities relate more closely to the number of tablets typically consumed per session rather than estimated total lifetime use. To better understand the basis of drug related deficits in prospective memory (p.m.) we explored the association between p.m. and average long-term typical dose and long-term frequency of use. Method: Study 1: Sixty-five ecstasy/polydrug users and 85 nonecstasy users completed an event-based, a short-term and a long-term time-based p.m. task. Study 2: Study 1 data were merged with outcomes on the same p.m. measures from a previous study creating a combined sample of 103 ecstasy/polydrug users, 38 cannabis-only users, and 65 nonusers of illicit drugs. Results: Study 1: Ecstasy/polydrug users had significant impairments on all p.m. outcomes compared with nonecstasy users. Study 2: Ecstasy/polydrug users were impaired in event-based p.m. compared with both other groups and in long-term time-based p.m. compared with nonillicit drug users. Both drug using groups did worse on the short-term time-based p.m. task compared with nonusers. Higher long-term average typical dose of ecstasy was associated with poorer performance on the event and short-term time-based p.m. tasks and accounted for unique variance in the two p.m. measures over and above the variance associated with cannabis and cocaine use. Conclusions: The typical ecstasy dose consumed in a single session is an important predictor of p.m. impairments with higher doses reflecting increasing tolerance giving rise to greater p.m. impairment. © 2013 American Psychological Association."
"1886","1","Modulation of Serum Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor by a Single Dose of Ayahuasca: Observation From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nSerotonergic psychedelics are emerging as potential antidepressant therapeutic tools, as suggested in a recent randomized controlled trial with ayahuasca for treatment-resistant depression. Preclinical and clinical studies have suggested that serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels increase after treatment with serotoninergic antidepressants, but the exact role of BDNF as a biomarker for diagnostic and treatment of major depression is still poorly understood. Here we investigated serum BDNF levels in healthy controls (N = 45) and patients with treatment-resistant depression (N = 28) before (baseline) and 48 h after (D2) a single dose of ayahuasca or placebo. In our sample, baseline serum BDNF levels did not predict major depression and the clinical characteristics of the patients did not predict their BDNF levels. However, at baseline, serum cortisol was a predictor of serum BDNF levels, where lower levels of serum BDNF were detected in a subgroup of subjects with hypocortisolemia. Moreover, at baseline we found a negative correlation between BDNF and serum cortisol in volunteers with eucortisolemia. After treatment (D2) we observed higher BDNF levels in both patients and controls that ingested ayahuasca (N = 35) when compared to placebo (N = 34). Furthermore, at D2 just patients treated with ayahuasca (N = 14), and not with placebo (N = 14), presented a significant negative correlation between serum BDNF levels and depressive symptoms. This is the first double-blind randomized placebo-controlled clinical trial that explored the modulation of BDNF in response to a psychedelic in patients with depression. The results suggest a potential link between the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and changes in serum BDNF, which contributes to the emerging view of using psychedelics as an antidepressant.

"4475","1","Adverse experiences resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking following the use of magic mushrooms.^\nBackground: Psilocybin-containing mushrooms are used for recreational, spiritual, self-development and therapeutic purposes. However, physiologically relatively nontoxic, adverse reactions are occasionally reported. Aims: This study investigated the 12-month prevalence and nature of magic mushroom-related adverse reactions resulting in emergency medical treatment seeking in a global sample of people reporting magic mushroom use. Methods: We use data from the 2017 Global Drug Survey – a large anonymous online survey on patterns of drug use conducted between November 2016 and January 2017. Results: Out of 9233 past year magic mushroom users, 19 (0.2%) reported having sought emergency medical treatment, with a per-event risk estimate of 0.06%. Young age was the only predictor associated with higher risk of emergency medical presentations. The most common symptoms were psychological, namely anxiety/panic and paranoia/suspiciousness. Poor ‘mindset’, poor ‘setting’ and mixing substances were most reported reasons for incidents. All but one respondent returned back to normality within 24 h. Conclusions: The results confirm psilocybin mushrooms are a relatively safe drug, with serious incidents rare and short lasting. Providing harm-reduction information likely plays a key role in preventing adverse effects. More research is needed to examine the detailed circumstances and predictors of adverse reactions including rarer physiological reactions."
"8976","1","Ketamine for the treatment of mental health and substance use disorders: comprehensive systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: In the past two decades, subanaesthetic doses of ketamine have been demonstrated to have rapid and sustained antidepressant effects, and accumulating research has demonstrated ketamine's therapeutic effects for a range of psychiatric conditions. AIMS: In light of these findings surrounding ketamine's psychotherapeutic potential, we systematically review the extant evidence on ketamine's effects in treating mental health disorders. METHOD: The systematic review protocol was registered in PROSPERO (identifier CRD42019130636). Human studies investigating the therapeutic effects of ketamine in the treatment of mental health disorders were included. Because of the extensive research in depression, bipolar disorder and suicidal ideation, only systematic reviews and meta-analyses were included. We searched Medline and PsycINFO on 21 October 2020. Risk-of-bias analysis was assessed with the Cochrane Risk of Bias tools and A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) Checklist. RESULTS: We included 83 published reports in the final review: 33 systematic reviews, 29 randomised controlled trials, two randomised trials without placebo, three non-randomised trials with controls, six open-label trials and ten retrospective reviews. The results were presented via narrative synthesis. CONCLUSIONS: Systematic reviews and meta-analyses provide support for robust, rapid and transient antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine. Evidence for other indications is less robust, but suggests similarly positive and short-lived effects. The conclusions should be interpreted with caution because of the high risk of bias of included studies. Optimal dosing, modes of administration and the most effective forms of adjunctive psychotherapeutic support should be examined further."

"1776","1","Mixtures of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (ecstasy) and its major human metabolites act additively to induce significant toxicity to liver cells when combined at low, non-cytotoxic concentrations.^\nHepatic injury after 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) intoxications is highly unpredictable and does not seem to correlate with either dosage or frequency of use. The mechanisms involved include the drug metabolic bioactivation and the hyperthermic state of the liver triggered by its thermogenic action and exacerbated by the environmental circumstances of abuse at hot and crowded venues. We became interested in understanding the interaction between ecstasy and its metabolites generated in vivo as users are always exposed to mixtures of parent drug and metabolites. With this purpose, Hep G2 cells were incubated with MDMA and its main human metabolites methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), α-methyldopamine (α-MeDA) and N-methyl-α-methyldopamine (N-Me-α-MeDA), individually and in mixture (drugs combined in proportion to their individual EC01), at normal (37 °C) and hyperthermic (40.5 °C) conditions. After 48 h, viability was assessed by the 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay. Extensive concentration-response analysis was performed with single drugs and the parameters of the individual non-linear logit fits were used to predict joint effects using the well-founded models of concentration addition (CA) and independent action (IA). Experimental testing revealed that mixture effects on cell viability conformed to CA, for both temperature settings. Additionally, substantial combination effects were attained even when each substance was present at concentrations that individually produced unnoticeable effects. Hyperthermic incubations dramatically increased the toxicity of the tested drug and metabolites, both individually and combined. These outcomes suggest that MDMA metabolism has hazard implications to liver cells even when metabolites are found in low concentrations, as they contribute additively to the overall toxic effect of MDMA. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"4487","0","Converging theories on dreaming: Between Freud, predictive processing, and psychedelic research.^\nDreams are still an enigma of human cognition, studied extensively in psychoanalysis and neuroscience. According to the Freudian dream theory and Solms' modifications of the unconscious derived from it, the fundamental task of meeting our emotional needs is guided by the principle of homeostasis. Our innate value system generates conscious feelings of pleasure and unpleasure, resulting in the behavior of approaching or withdrawing from the world of objects. Based on these experiences, a hierarchical generative model of predictions (priors) about the world is constantly created and modified, with the aim to optimize the meeting of our needs by reducing prediction error, as described in the predictive processing model of cognition. Growing evidence from neuroimaging supports this theory. The same hierarchical functioning of the brain is in place during sleep and dreaming, with some important modifications like a lack of sensual and motor perception and action. Another characteristic of dreaming is the predominance of primary process thinking, an associative, non-rational cognitive style, which can be found in similar altered states of consciousness like the effect of psychedelics. Mental events that do not successfully fulfill an emotional need will cause a prediction error, leading to conscious attention and adaptation of the priors that incorrectly predicted the event. However, this is not the case for repressed priors (RPs), which are defined by the inability to become reconsolidated or removed, despite ongoing error signal production. We hypothesize that Solms' RPs correspond with the conflictual complexes, as described by Moser in his dream formation theory. Thus, in dreams and dream-like states, these unconscious RPs might become accessible in symbolic and non-declarative forms that the subject is able to feel and make sense of. Finally, we present the similarities between dreaming and the psychedelic state. Insights from psychedelic research could be used to inform dream research and related therapeutic interventions, and vice versa. We propose further empirical research questions and methods and finally present our ongoing trial ""Biological Functions of Dreaming"" to test the hypothesis that dreaming predicts intact sleep architecture and memory consolidation, via a lesion model with stroke patients who lost the ability to dream."

Mushroom ingestions in Texas were studied for 2005-2006. Methods: Data was obtained via Texas Poison Control Centers and retrospectively reviewed. Case notes were reviewed individually regarding initial reporting, age, signs and symptoms, toxic effect, management, and patient outcomes. Results: A total of 742 exposures occurred during the study period. All exposures were acute and intentional. Of these exposures, 59 (7.9%) were admitted to the hospital, with 17 (28.8% of admissions) requiring admission to a critical care unit. Four cases required inpatient psychiatric admission. The average age of admitted exposures was 20.5 years, with a male-to-female predominance of 3.3:1. Eleven (22.9%) of the admitted exposures were identified, with Psilocybin being the most common agent (n = 10, 91%). Among the admissions, co-ingestions were identified with the mushroom ingestion in eleven patients (40.7%). The most common symptoms in admitted patients were vomiting (n = 34, 57.6%), nausea (n = 19, 32.2%), altered mental status (n = 17, 28.8%), abdominal pain (n = 13, 22%), and diarrhea (n = 10, 16.9%). Conclusions: All mushroom exposures examined were acute and intentional. Major toxic reactions were uncommon, and no deaths were reported.

Available treatments for prolonged grief disorder are promising but leave room for considerable improvement. Qualitative accounts of psychedelic experiences after bereavement reveal themes that parallel core components of prolonged grief disorder therapy. However, few studies have investigated the therapeutic potential of psychedelics for symptoms of grief. The present study surveyed recreational psychedelic users (N = 363) who had suffered a bereavement event. They reported retrospective grief symptoms before and after the psychedelic experience as well as subjective reactions to the psychedelic, including emotional breakthroughs and challenging experiences. Results indicate improvements in grief symptoms after a psychedelic experience, with a large effect size (Cohen’s d = 0.83). The occurrence of emotional breakthroughs was positively associated with improvements in symptoms of grief, while the converse relation was observed for challenging experiences. Findings provide preliminary evidence that support the development of a psychedelic-assisted therapy protocol to target symptoms of grief. Psychedelic-assisted therapy might offer an alternative to current grief treatment options."
"2290","0","The potential of (1)H-MRS in CNS drug development.^\nRATIONALE: Proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy ((1)H-MRS) is a cross-species neuroimaging technique that can measure concentrations of several brain metabolites, including glutamate and GABA. This non-invasive method has promise in developing centrally acting drugs, as it can be performed repeatedly within-subjects and be used to translate findings from the preclinical to clinical laboratory using the same imaging biomarker. OBJECTIVES: This review focuses on the utility of single-voxel (1)H-MRS in developing novel glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and includes research performed in rodent models, healthy volunteers and patient cohorts. RESULTS: Overall, these studies indicate that (1)H-MRS is able to detect the predicted pharmacological effects of glutamatergic or GABAergic drugs on voxel glutamate or GABA concentrations, although there is a shortage of studies examining dose-related effects. Clinical studies have applied (1)H-MRS to better understand drug therapeutic mechanisms, including the glutamatergic effects of ketamine in depression and of acamprosate in alcohol dependence. There is an emerging interest in identifying patient subgroups with 'high' or 'low' brain regional (1)H-MRS glutamate levels for more targeted drug development, which may require ancillary biomarkers to improve the accuracy of subgroup discrimination. CONCLUSIONS: Considerations for future research include the sensitivity of single-voxel (1)H-MRS in detecting drug effects, inter-site measurement reliability and the interpretation of drug-induced changes in (1)H-MRS metabolites relative to the known pharmacological molecular mechanisms. On-going technological development, in single-voxel (1)H-MRS and in related complementary techniques, will further support applications within CNS drug discovery."
"4639","1","Acute dose of MDMA (75 mg) impairs spatial memory for location but leaves contextual processing of visuospatial information unaffected.^\nRATIONALE: Research concerning spatial memory in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users has presented conflicting results showing either the presence or absence of spatial memory deficits. Two factors may have confounded results in abstinent users: memory task characteristics and polydrug use. OBJECTIVES: The present study aims to assess whether a single dose of MDMA affects spatial memory performance during intoxication and withdrawal phase and whether spatial memory performance after MDMA is task dependent. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eighteen recreational MDMA users participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, three-way crossover design. They were treated with placebo, MDMA 75 mg, and methylphenidate 20 mg. Memory tests were conducted between 1.5 and 2 h (intoxication phase) and between 25.5 and 26 h (withdrawal phase) post-dosing. Two spatial memory tasks of varying complexity were used that required either storage of stimulus location alone (spatial memory task) or memory for location as well as processing of content or contextual information (change blindness task). RESULTS: After a single dose of MDMA, the subjects made larger localization errors and responded faster compared to placebo in the simple spatial memory task during intoxication phase. Inaccuracy was not due to increased response speed, as determined by regression analysis. Performance in the change blindness task was not affected by MDMA. Methylphenidate did not affect performance on any of the tasks. CONCLUSION: It is concluded that a single dose of MDMA impairs spatial memory for location but leaves processing of contextual information intact."
"2645","0","Clinical benefits and risks of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonists to treat severe opioid use disorder: A systematic review.^\nBackground: Demand for treatments for severe opioid use disorder is increasing worldwide. The current pharmacotherapy is mainly focused on opioid and adrenergic receptors. The N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) is among other receptors that can also be targeted to treat the disease. Findings from randomized controlled trials (RTCs) on NMDAR antagonists to treat severe opioid use disorder amply varied. This study aimed to evaluate the clinical benefits and assess the potential risks for adverse events or side effects of NMDAR antagonists that were investigated for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder. Methods: Articles were searched in PubMed, Scopus, Google Scholar, Proquest. Cochrane Review Database, Medline Ovid, and EMBASE from their inception to March 2019. RTCs on NMDAR antagonists for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder were independently screened and assessed by two authors. The results were synthesized qualitatively. Results: Nineteen RTCs of 1459 participants met the inclusion criteria. There is moderate evidence suggesting that ketamine, memantine, amantadine, and dextromethorphan may be able to manage opioid withdrawal symptoms. There is little evidence suggesting that memantine may be able to reduce methadone maintenance dose in participants on methadone, reduce opioid use, and reduce craving. Dropout is noticeable among dextromethorphan’s participants. Safety concerns are more likely associated with dextromethorphan and ketamine. Conclusions: NMDAR antagonists have the potentiality to treat severe opioid use disorder. There is insufficient evidence to recommend them for the treatment of severe opioid use disorder due to several limitations inherent to the RCTs reviewed. Further exploration is needed.

"1424","0","Effect of different doses of esketamine compared with fentanyl combined with propofol on hypotension in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery: a prospective, randomized, double-blind controlled clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Opioids analgesics commonly used in abortion procedures are associated with respiratory and circulatory depression. Esketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDA) antagonist and a common analgesic. The drug has several advantages including rapid onset and offset and it causes minimal cardiorespiratory depression. However, studies have not explored the effects of esketamine in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery. Therefore, the present study sought to evaluate the effect of different doses of esketamine compared with the effect of fentanyl on incidence of perioperative hypotension in patients undergoing painless abortion surgery and to explore the optimal esketamine dose for this population. METHODS: A total of 178 female patients undergoing painless abortion surgery were enrolled to the current study. The patients were aged 18-45 years, had a body mass index (BMI) of 18-28 kg m(- 2) and a class I or II physical status as determined using the American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) system. Patients were randomly assigned to four groups as follows: group F (n = 45) in which patients underwent intravenous (IV) administration of 1 μg kg(- 1) fentanyl followed by IV administration of 2 mg kg(- 1) propofol, and group EL, group EM and group EH (n = 45, 44, 44) with patients receiving IV administration of 0.2 mg kg(- 1), 0.25 mg kg(- 1), 0.3 mg kg(- 1) esketamine, respectively, followed by IV administration of 2 mg kg(- 1) propofol. The primary outcome of the study was the incidence of hypotension whereas secondary outcomes included incidence of adverse events, perioperative changes of vital signs, anesthesia induction time, recovery time and dischargeable time, propofol addition, as well as patient, surgeon and anesthesiologist satisfaction levels. RESULTS: The findings showed that the incidence of hypotension was significantly lower in subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH (0, 0, 0%) relative to the incidence in patients in group F (20%) (χ(2) = 19.648; P = 0.000). In this study, the incidence of hypoxia of subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH (0, 2.3, 2.3%) was significantly lower compared with that of patients in group F (11.1%) (χ(2) = 8.622; P = 0.035). The findings indicated that the incidence of somatic motor reactions was significantly lower in participants in group EM and group EH (9.1, 4.5%) relative to that of patients in group F and group EL (26.7, 15.6%) (χ(2) = 10.254; P = 0.016). The results showed that the incidence of nausea and vomiting and potential psychiatric symptoms were significantly higher in patients in group EH (15.9, 11.4%) compared with that of participants in group F (2.2, 0%), group EL (4.4, 0%) and group EM (2.3, 2.3%) (χ(2) = 7.493; P = 0.038 and χ(2) = 8.248; P = 0.003). In this study, the mean arterial pressure (MAP) and heart rate (HR) of subjects in group EL, group EM and group EH were more stable compared with that of patients in group F. Frequency of the additional propofol dose was markedly less in group EM and EH (26.7%, 17,8%) compared with that in group F and EL (9.1, 4.5%) (χ(2) = 10.254; P = 0.016). The findings indicated that the dischargeable time was significantly shorter for patients in group EM compared with that of subjects in group F, group EL and group EH. CONCLUSIONS: The findings of the present study showed that single-dose esketamine (0.25 mg kg(- 1)) effectively decreased incidence of hypotension and total adverse events and reduced the frequency of additional propofol dose required for patients undergoing painless abortion with preservation of physician-patient satisfaction."

"4696","0","Acute effects of pentazocine, naloxone and morphine in opioid-dependent volunteers.^\nThe purpose of this study was to evaluate the agonist and antagonist properties of pentazocine, an opioid mixed agonist-antagonist analgesic, in relation to prototypic opioid agonist and antagonist drugs in opioid-dependent human subjects. Pentazocine (45 and 60 mg), naloxone (0.1 and 0.2 mg), morphine (20, 40 and 60 mg) and saline placebo were administered intramuscularly to six male volunteers maintained on methadone (30 mg/24 hr p.o.), following a double-blind, randomized block order design. Drugs were administered 20 hr after the last dose of methadone. Subject-reported effects and physiological measures were collected before drug administration and during 4 hr postadministration. Morphine produced significant dose-related increases in subjective measures characteristic of mu agonist effects, decreased pupil diameter and was classified as an opioid agonist. Naloxone precipitated a dose-related opioid withdrawal syndrome which was measurable on several subject-rated measures, and significantly increased pupil diameter. Subjects consistently identified naloxone as an antagonist. Pentazocine precipitated a withdrawal syndrome, but the effects were not dose-dependent, and produced symptoms of confusion and dysphoric changes that were not observed after naloxone administration. Pentazocine was classified as an antagonist by some individuals, and as alcohol or hallucinogen by others. The results of the present study indicate that pentazocine acts in humans as a partial mu agonist with a non-mu component of activity."
"4900","0","Glutamatergic Dysfunction and Glutamatergic Compounds for Major Psychiatric Disorders: Evidence From Clinical Neuroimaging Studies.^\nExcessive glutamate release has been linked to stress and many neurodegenerative diseases. Evidence indicates abnormalities of glutamatergic neurotransmission or glutamatergic dysfunction as playing an important role in the development of many major psychiatric disorders (e.g., schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depressive disorder). Recently, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate antagonist, has been demonstrated to have promisingly rapid antidepressant efficacy for treatment-resistant depression. Many compounds that target the glutamate system have also become available that possess potential in the treatment of major psychiatric disorders. In this review, we update evidence from recent human studies that directly or indirectly measured glutamatergic neurotransmission and function in major psychiatric disorders using modalities such as magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography/single-photon emission computed tomography, and paired-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation. The newer generation of antidepressants that target the glutamatergic system developed in human clinical studies is also reviewed."
"7998","1","Recreational drug consumers: Who seeks treatment?.^\nBackground: Recreational drug consumption represents a complex issue, because of the lack of a shared definition, settings and patterns of consumptions, and poorness of evidence-based treatments. In spite of the great number of users, just few seek specific treatment, probably representing those at major risk of continuing and problematic use. The general objective of this study was to report the characteristics and main consumption patterns of recreational drug consumers treated in Regione Piemonte (Italy), in order to formulate hypotheses suitable for further research aimed at establishing more effective preventive intervention and treatment. Methods: All addiction treatment services in the region were required to fill in, for each user, a questionnaire reporting: contact of the user with the service, socio-demoghaphic data, drugs consumption and interventions/treatments. Results: Among 441 users, 70.3% were new users, 85.5% were males and the average age of consumption onset was 22 years. Psychiatric and traumatics events were present in 13.3% and in 17.9% of cases, respectively. The most frequent primary substances were cocaine (76.9%) and ecstasy (13.8%). Substances taken in association with primary drug are quoted in 75% of cases. Conclusions: The users that get in touch with services are those showing greater problems, representing, therefore, the main target for preventive public health interventions. Some interesting points can be noted: among patients treated, cocaine represents the main issue; females seem to be more sensitive to recreational drug effects; social class (education), settings and use habits are similar for recreational drugs users and heroin users. © The Author 2005.

"4414","1","Nicotine and smoker status moderate brain electric and mood activation induced by ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist.^\nAs the increased smoking prevalence in schizophrenics may be interpreted as an adaptive response to an underlying biological defect, investigations into nicotine's actions within N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist drug models of schizophrenia may improve our understanding of the role of glutamatergic neurotransmission in initiating and maintaining nicotine dependence in this disorder. In this double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study, the electroencephalographic (EEG) and subjective response to a sub-psychotomimetic intravenous dose of the NMDA antagonist ketamine was examined in 20 regular smokers and 20 non-smokers pretreated with placebo or nicotine gum. Although nicotine increased EEG arousal, ketamine produced electrocerebral signs of brain activation (decreased slow wave power) and sedation (decreased fast wave power and frequency), which were not affected by nicotine pretreatment and were evident only in non-smokers. Ketamine increased a number of self-report indices of subjective arousal, some of which were attenuated and potentiated by nicotine in smokers and non-smokers, respectively. These findings suggest that long-term (evidenced by smoker vs. non-smoker comparisons) and short-term (acute) nicotine exposure may alter NMDA receptor-mediated arousal and mood systems in a way that promotes nicotine dependence in smokers, and addresses neurobiological deficiencies in smokers with schizophrenia.

"2114","1","Ketamine for acute suicidal ideation. An emergency department intervention: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Depressed patients presenting to emergency departments with acute suicidal ideation are a major public health concern. Ketamine, a rapidly acting antidepressant with antisuicidal properties, might offer relief. METHODS: In a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, proof-of-concept trial, 18 depressed subjects with acute suicidal ideation, who required hospitalization, were randomized to either an intravenous ketamine 0.2 mg/kg group or a saline placebo group. Safety and efficacy evaluations were scheduled for 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, and 240 min, and on Days 1, 2, 3, 7, and 14 after infusion. The main outcome measure was suicidal ideation with secondary measures of depression. RESULTS: Nine subjects were randomized to each group. There were no differences between groups at baseline in any demographic or assessment scales. A reduction in suicidal ideation was noted at 90-180 min (p < .05). Ninety minutes after infusion, 88% of the ketamine group had achieved remission of suicidal ideation compared with 33% in the placebo group (p < .05). No serious adverse events were noted. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine was safe and effective for rapid reduction in suicidal ideation in depressed, highly suicidal subjects presenting to the emergency department. Our results support further study of ketamine for acute suicidal ideation."
"5914","1","Ketamine for the rapid treatment of suicidal ideation: new findings from a randomized controlled trial.^\nBackground: Suicide is a devastating public health problem and very few biological treatments have been found to be effective in decreasing the intensity of suicidal ideation (SI) or the risk of suicide. We have previously shown that a single dose of ketamine, a glutamate N‐methyl‐d‐aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, is associated with a rapid reduction in depressive symptom severity and SI in patients with treatment resistant depression. Methods: We conducted a randomized, controlled trial of ketamine in patients who presented with clinically significant SI across a trans‐diagnostic sample (n=24). Patients received a single infusion of ketamine or midazolam (as an active placebo) in addition to standard of care. Suicidal ideation measured using the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSI) 24 hours post‐treatment represented the primary outcome. Secondary analyses included the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale‐Suicidal Ideation (MADRS‐SI) score at 24 hours and additional measures beyond the 24‐hour time point. Results: The intervention was well tolerated and no dropouts occurred during the primary 7‐day assessment period. BSI score was not different between the treatment groups at 24 hours (p=0.32), however a significant difference emerged at 48 hours (p=0.047). MADRS‐SI score was lower in the ketamine compared to midazolam group at 24 hours (p=0.05). The treatment effect was no longer significant at the end of the 7‐day assessment period. Conclusions: The current findings provide support for the safety, tolerability and efficacy of ketamine as an intervention for suicidal ideation in patients who are at risk for suicidal behavior across mood and anxiety disorders."

"1278","1","Neural correlates of the LSD experience revealed by multimodal neuroimaging.^\nLysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is the prototypical psychedelic drug, but its effects on the human brain have never been studied before with modern neuroimaging. Here, three complementary neuroimaging techniques: arterial spin labeling (ASL), blood oxygen leveldependent (BOLD) measures, and magnetoencephalography (MEG), implemented during resting state conditions, revealed marked changes in brain activity after LSD that correlated strongly with its characteristic psychological effects. Increased visual cortex cerebral blood flow (CBF), decreased visual cortex alpha power, and a greatly expanded primary visual cortex (V1) functional connectivity profile correlated strongly with ratings of visual hallucinations, implying that intrinsic brain activity exerts greater influence on visual processing in the psychedelic state, thereby defining its hallucinatory quality. LSD's marked effects on the visual cortex did not significantly correlate with the drug's other characteristic effects on consciousness, however. Rather, decreased connectivity between the parahippocampus and retrosplenial cortex (RSC) correlated strongly with ratings of ""ego-dissolution"" and ""altered meaning,"" implying the importance of this particular circuit for the maintenance of ""self"" or ""ego"" and its processing of ""meaning."" Strong relationships were also found between the different imaging metrics, enabling firmer inferences to be made about their functional significance. This uniquely comprehensive examination of the LSD state represents an important advance in scientific research with psychedelic drugs at a time of growing interest in their scientific and therapeutic value. The present results contribute important new insights into the characteristic hallucinatory and consciousness- altering properties of psychedelics that inform on how they can model certain pathological states and potentially treat others."
"7530","0","Classic psychedelics do not affect T cell and monocyte immune responses.^\nIntroduction: Classic psychedelics have been shown to exert therapeutic potential for the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, neuropsychiatric diseases, and neuronal damage. Besides their psychopharmacological activity, psychedelics have been reported to modulate immune functions. There has thus far been a sparse exploration of the direct immune-modulating effect of psychedelics on human immune cells in vitro. Since T cells are key mediators of several immune functions, inhibition of their function would increase the risk of infections. Methods: We investigated the effect of the classic psychedelics lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocin, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), and mescaline on the proliferation and stimulated cytokine release of primary human T lymphocytes and on the stimulated NF-κB induction of monocytes. Results: We did not observe any relevant direct immune-modulatory effects of the tested classic psychedelics in either cell line. Discussion: We concluded that LSD, psilocin, DMT, or mescaline did not directly stimulate the proliferation or cytokine secretion of primary human T lymphocytes or stimulate NF-κB induction of monocytes. Our findings support the future safe use of classic psychedelics in assisted psychotherapy in patients with life-threatening diseases where immune suppression and diminished immune function would be detrimental."

Data were obtained from the Global Drug Survey (an anonymous online survey of people, many of whom have used drugs) conducted between November and December 2012 with 22,289 responses. Lifetime prevalence of DMT use was 8.9% (n=1980) and past year prevalence use was 5.0% (n=1123). We explored the effect profile of DMT in 472 participants who identified DMT as the last new drug they had tried for the first time and compared it with ratings provided by other respondents on psilocybin (magic mushrooms), LSD and ketamine. DMT was most often smoked and offered a strong, intense, short-lived psychedelic high with relatively few negative effects or ""come down"". It had a larger proportion of new users compared with the other substances (24%), suggesting its popularity may increase. Overall, DMT seems to have a very desirable effect profile indicating a high abuse liability that maybe offset by a low urge to use more. © The Author(s) 2013."
"8319","1","Differential tolerance to biological and subjective effects of four closely spaced doses of N,N-dimethyltryptamine in humans.^\nTolerance of the behavioral effects of the short-acting, endogenous hallucinogen, N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) is seen inconsistently in animals, and has not been produced in humans. The nature and time course of responses to repetitive, closely spaced administrations of an hallucinogenic dose of DMT were characterized. Thirteen experienced hallucinogen users received intravenous 0.3 mg/kg DMT fumarate, or saline placebo, four times, at 30 min intervals, on 2 separate days, in a randomized, double-blind, design. Tolerance to ""psychedelic"" subjective effects did not occur according to either clinical interview or Hallucinogen Rating Scale scores. Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), prolactin, cortisol, and heart rate responses decreased with repeated DMT administration, although blood pressure did not. These data demonstrate the unique properties of DMT relative to other hallucinogens and underscore the differential regulation of the multiple processes mediating the effects of DMT."
"4294","1","Ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders: systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is an effective short-term treatment for a range of psychiatric disorders. A key question is whether the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment improves outcomes or delays relapse. AIM: To identify all studies combining psychotherapy with ketamine for the treatment of psychiatric disorders to summarise their effects and make recommendations for future research. METHOD: The review protocol was prospectively registered with PROSPERO (registration number CRD42022318120). Potential studies were searched for in MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, SCOPUS, the Cochrane library and Google Scholar. Eligible studies combined ketamine and psychotherapy for the treatment of psychiatric disorders and did not use case reports or qualitative designs. Key findings relating to psychotherapy type, diagnosis, ketamine protocol, sequencing of psychotherapy and study design are reported. Risk of bias was assessed using modified Joanna Briggs critical appraisal tools. RESULTS: Nineteen studies evaluating 1006 patients were included in the systematic review. A variety of supportive individual and group, manualised and non-manualised psychotherapies were used. The majority of studies evaluated substance use disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder and treatment-resistant depression. Ketamine protocols and sequencing of ketamine/psychotherapy treatment varied substantially between studies. Outcomes were largely positive for the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine treatment. CONCLUSION: The combination of psychotherapy and ketamine offers promise for the treatment of psychiatric disorders, but study heterogeneity prevents definitive recommendations for their integration. Larger randomised controlled trials using manualised psychotherapies and standardised ketamine protocols are recommended to clarify the extent to which the addition of psychotherapy to ketamine improves outcomes over ketamine treatment alone."

Widely available stimulants such as caffeine, but also prescription substances such as methylphenidate and modafinil, are being used by healthy individuals to enhance cognitive performance. Objectives There is a lack of knowledge on the effects of prescription stimulants when taken by healthy individuals (as compared with patients) and especially on the effects of different substances across different cognitive domains. Methods We conducted a pilot study with three arms in which male participants received placebo and one of three stimulants (caffeine, methylphenidate, modafinil) and assessed cognitive performance with a test battery that captures various cognitive domains. Results Our study showed some moderate effects of the three stimulants tested. Methylphenidate had positive effects on self-reported fatigue as well as on declarative memory 24 hours after learning; caffeine had a positive effect on sustained attention; there was no significant effect of modafinil in any of the instruments of our test battery. All stimulants were well tolerated, and no trade-off negative effects on other cognitive domains were found. Conclusions The few observed significant positive effects of the tested stimulants were domain-specific and of rather low magnitude. The results can inform the use of stimulants for cognitive enhancement purposes as well as direct further research to investigate the effects of stimulants on specific cognitive domains that seem most promising, possibly by using tasks that are more demanding."

According to the statistics of the WHO, by 2017, there were more than 300 million people suffering from depression, accounting for 4.4% of the global population. Depression is highly related to suicide, which is an important reason for suicidal intention and attempt. It has been demonstrated that the incidence of suicide associated with major depression was as high as 15%. The main characteristic of depression is significant and lasting depression, which is caused by the decrease of monoamine transmitters (including dopamine, 5‐HT, et al.) related to mood. In the past, antidepressants mainly relied on increasing or reducing the metabolism of transmitters, but these drugs usually took weeks or even months to take effect, and although the symptoms of depression were relieved within weeks after the start of treatment, they were still not ideal in the long term. Therefore, the drug treatment of depression is not optimistic. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), as the first biological therapy introduced into psychiatry, has been improving with the progress of technology and equipment. More studies show that ECT is a safe and effective treatment, and the treatment of severe depression is the first choice in some cases. However, cognitive dysfunction, relapse tendency and related safety after ECT need further study. Short acting sedatives and muscle relaxants before ECT can minimize the fear and muscle pain caused by ECT induced seizures. Previous sedatives used include propofol, mesaclopidol, thiopental and ketamine. Ketamine can be used for ECT anesthesia in patients with depression because of its good epileptic characteristics and prevention of cognitive dysfunction after ECT. More evidences reveal ketamine has strong antidepressant effect and reduces suicide of patients with treatment‐resistant depression or mania. The low dose of ketamine can take effect within one hour, produce rapid antidepressant effect, and can play a role in more than 70% of patients with refractory depression. In addition, even a single intravenous injection of ketamine can effectively reduce the symptoms of depression within 24‐72 hours, and may have synergistic antidepressant effect when combined with ECT. Although ketamine is considered to have a significant antidepressant effect in patients with depression, its application in mental disorders remains to be further explored because it may aggravate mental symptoms. However, some studies also found that ketamine did not significantly improve the effect of ECT on depression compared with other anesthetics. Esketamine is the isomer of ketamine, which mainly acts on NMDA receptor of glutamate and its affinity to the receptor is 3‐4 times that of ketamine, therefore it has stronger effect. Evidence suggests that esketamine can regulate NMDA receptor, increase the release of various neurotransmitters, improve the depression of patients, and repair the damaged neurons to improve the neuronal connections in the brain. As an anesthetic, the potency of esketamine is two times higher than ketamine, three times higher than R‐ketamine, and its drug metabolism time is shorter, and the related side effects are also significantly reduced. Conseuqently, it has been widely used as an anesthetic in some countries. The efficacy and safety of esketamine nasal spray as a rapid and effective antidepressant in the treatment of patients with refractory depression have been confirmed. However the effect of intravenous esketamine as an anesthetic in ECT anesthesia on patients who are depressed remains unknown. The aim of this study is to evaluate the short‐term effect and safety of esketamine as a adjunctive anesthetic in routine ECT anesthesia for patients with depression."
"4441","0","Overlap in the neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine abuse and its use as an antidepressant.^\nKetamine, a dissociative anesthetic and psychedelic compound, has revolutionized the field of psychopharmacology by showing robust, and rapid-acting antidepressant activity in patients suffering from major depressive disorder (MDD), suicidal tendencies, and treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Ketamine's efficacy, however, is transient, and patients must return to the clinic for repeated treatment as they experience relapse. This is cause for concern because ketamine is known for its abuse liability, and repeated exposure to drugs of abuse often leads to drug abuse/dependence. Though the mechanism(s) underlying its antidepressant activity is an area of current intense research, both clinical and preclinical evidence shows that ketamine's effects are mediated, at least in part, by molecular adaptations resulting in long-lasting synaptic changes in mesolimbic brain regions known to regulate natural and drug reward. This review outlines our limited knowledge of ketamine's neurobiological and biochemical underpinnings mediating its antidepressant effects and correlates them to its abuse potential. Depression and addiction share overlapping neural circuitry and molecular mechanisms, and though speculative, repeated use of ketamine for the treatment of depression could lead to the development of substance use disorder/addiction, and thus should be tempered with caution. There is much that remains to be known about the long-term effects of ketamine, and our lack of understanding of neurobiological mechanisms underlying its antidepressant effects is a clear limiting factor that needs to be addressed systematically before using repeated ketamine in the treatment of depressed patients."

In a double-blind placebo-controlled, cross-over study we administered 140 mg of MDE or placebo orally to eight healthy male volunteers at 1:30 P.M. Serum cortisol, prolactin (PRL), and growth hormone (GH) levels, as well as blood pressure, and heart rate were measured every 20 minutes until 5:00 P.M. Administration of MDE was followed by statistically significant long-lasting increases of serum cortisol, PRL, systolic blood pressure, and heart rate, and by a trend toward blunting of GH secretion. The neuroendocrine and cardiovascular effects of MDE are comparable to those of other phenethylamines with the exception of the effect on GH secretion."
"9513","1","Subjective effects of MDMA ('Ecstasy') on human sexual function.^\nSexual function following 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or 'Ecstasy') consumption was subjectively evaluated in 35 healthy recreational users (20 men and 15 women, aged 21-48 years) with regard to four major domains of sexual activity: desire, erection (lubrication in women), orgasm and satisfaction. Desire and satisfaction were moderately to profoundly increased by MDMA in more than 90% of subjects. Orgasm was delayed but perceived as more intense. Erection was impaired in 40% of the men. It seems that MDMA impairs sexual performance, in spite of enhancement of sexual desire and the perception of greater satisfaction. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS."
"6734","0","COMPARING THE EFFECTIVENESS OF TWO FORMS OF TIME-SPACE SAMPLING TO IDENTIFY CLUB DRUG-USING YOUNG ADULTS.^\nTime-space sampling has been used to generate representative samples of both hard-to-reach and location-based populations. Because of its emphasis on multi-tiered randomization (i.e., time, space, and individual), some have questioned the feasibility of time-space sampling as a cost-effective strategy. In an effort to better understand issues related to drug use among club-going young adults (ages 18 to 29) in the New York City nightlife scene, two variations of time-space sampling methods were utilized and compared (Version 1: randomized venue, day, and individuals within venues: Version 2: randomized venue and day). A list of nightlife venues were randomized and survey teams approached potential participants as they entered or exited venues to conduct brief anonymous surveys. Over the course of 24 months, 18,169 approaches were conducted and 10,678 consented to complete the brief questionnaire (V1 response rate = 46.0%, V2 response rate = 62.5%). Drug use was fairly common, with nearly two-thirds of the sample reporting having ever tried an illegal drug and more than half of drug users specifically tried either MDMA/ecstasy and/or cocaine. There were few differences between young adults surveyed during Version 1 and Version 2. Time-space sampling is an effective strategy to quickly detect and screen club drug users. Although caution is urged, elimination of the third tier of randomization (i.e., individual level counting) from time-space sampling may significantly improve response rates while only minimally impacting sample characteristics."
"6662","0","Hollow-fiber liquid-phase microextraction of amphetamine-type stimulants in human hair samples.^\nA fast method was optimized and validated in order to quantify amphetamine-type stimulants (amphetamine, AMP; methamphetamine, MAMP; fenproporex, FPX; 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, MDMA; and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine, MDA) in human hair samples. The method was based in an initial procedure of decontamination of hair samples (50mg) with dichloromethane, followed by alkaline hydrolysis and extraction of the amphetamines using hollow-fiber liquid-phase micro extraction (HF-LPME) in the three-phase mode. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) was used for identification and quantification of the analytes. The LoQs obtained for all amphetamines (around 0.05ng/mg) were below the cut-off value (0.2ng/mg) established by the Society of Hair Testing (SoHT). The method showed to be simple and precise. The intra-day and inter-day precisions were within 10.6% and 11.4%, respectively, with the use of only two deuterated internal standards (AMP-d5 and MDMA-d5). By using the weighted least squares linear regression (1/x2), the accuracy of the method was satisfied in the lower concentration levels (accuracy values better than 87%). Hair samples collected from six volunteers who reported regular use of amphetamines were submitted to the developed method. Drug detection was observed in all samples of the volunteers. © 2012 Elsevier B.V."
"7266","0","Dopamine and sense of agency: Determinants in personality and substance use.^\nSense of agency refers to the feeling of control over one’s own actions. The strength of this sense varies inter-individually. This means that people differ in their perception concerning the intensity of their intentions and actions. The current study aims to determine the factors influencing this sense of agency on a personality level. Furthermore, it gives insight into the correlative relation between the strength of the sense of agency and substance use. The study involved 210 participants who were tested for the experiment (intentional binding paradigm for sense of agency, hand paradigm for intentionality bias, questionnaires FAD-Plus, NI-20, substance use). Significant determinants in personality were narcissism (vulnerable subtype) and substance use (consumption in general beyond cannabis, and particularly for the substances cannabis, ecstasy, and cocaine). Both personality types were associated with a weaker sense of agency compared to controls. For both results, alterations in the dopaminergic system need to be discussed. The present results confirm prior hypotheses that dopamine seems to play a crucial role in perception of agency. Possibly a higher accessibility of dopamine increases sense of agency (hyper-binding), whereas a lower accessibility of dopamine decreases sense of agency (hypo-binding). A second aim of the study was to see whether there is a connection between sense of agency and intentionality bias. The perception of intention in others differs widely; some people tend to see arbitrary or accidental actions as unintentional, and others quickly label actions as ‘intentional’ although the information is not distinct for a categorization. This cognitive error is called intentionality bias. Results could not confirm a relationship between the two constructs-one’s own intention and judging intention in others. This may be due to a lack of connection between the two constructs or to methodological aspects. Further directions and limitations are discussed."
"892","1","Rejection and acceptance of LSD: Users and controls compared.^\nIn reviewing the natural history of LSD use, one is impressed with the rapid expansion of the size of the group which has taken the drug. Many individuals seem to be ready to have that sort of drug experience and, afterward, some become enthusiastic proselytizers. But their efforts to persuade others to take the drug do not always succeed; there are many individuals who are unwilling to try LSD. One is immediately curious. In what ways do those who resist taking LSD differ from those who are willing to take it? It is possible that these differences, if they can be isolated as variables, might be found to play an important role in impeding or facilitating the diffusion of other mind-altering drugs, alcohol or marijuana, for example. In the meantime, if one can set forth the variables which influence the acceptance or rejection of LSD, one has added to the understanding of the natural history of its use. We expected that resistance to LSD, defined as the refusal to take the drag when it was offered or a failure to pursue an opportunity to take the drug in circumstances where it was available, would depend upon four general sets of factors: the kind of information the person had about LSD effects in relationship to the kind of life experiences he was interested in having; the relationship of the potential receiver of LSD to the one offering it, including the evaluation of the latter by the former in terms of dominance, obligation, trustworthiness, and admiration; the life circumstances of the potential receiver in terms of general life satisfaction and distress; and the personality of the potential receiver, with special reference to ego control, flexibility, feelings of trust, and invulnerability. Interviews, observations, questionnaires, and participant interaction are productive research tools but do not provide a rigid experimental test of hypotheses. However, the hypotheses advanced have been of a rather general nature, and we think the method of inquiry fits the questions. The data do support a finding of consistent differences between persons who accept and reject LSD. Furthermore, drag-accepting behavior does appear to vary in the predicted direction with the kind of information a person possesses, with his or her relationship to the potential initiator in terms of power and status, with the personality of the person with reference to anxiety, ego control, and trust-distrust, and with the life circumstances of the person. More than these, a variety of other differences emerged which should be of considerable interest. Before reporting the findings, it is well to spend a moment on the control group employed. Its selection involved the same problems found in trying to obtain an LSD-using sample. We looked where we could to find people who had had the chance to take LSD and who had refused it. The best source of information was from LSD users themselves; they spoke of those who had rejected the drag. We inquired among persons already interviewed and among our acquaintances for leads to control subjects. In the end, we obtained a sample of forty-seven controls. We cannot contend that they are representative of all controls; we have no way of knowing how many people have had LSD offered to them, nor have we any way of knowing the characteristics of that population.

"4453","1","Two-dimensional gas chromatography/electron-impact mass spectrometry with cryofocusing for simultaneous quantification of MDMA, MDA, HMMA, HMA, and MDEA in human plasma.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, or Ecstasy) is a popular recreational drug. Analysis of MDMA and metabolites in human plasma, particularly in pharmacokinetic studies, requires low limits of quantification. Two-dimensional GC/MS with cryofocusing is a chromatographic technique recognized for its increased selectivity and resolution. METHODS: This method simultaneously quantifies 3,4-methylenedioxyethylamphetamine (MDEA), MDMA, and its metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 4-hydroxy-3- methoxymethamphetamine (HMMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxyamphetamine (HMA) in human plasma. With hydrochloric acid, we hydrolyzed 1 mL plasma, fortified with internal standard. Analytes were subjected to solidphase extraction, derivatized with heptafluorobutyric acid anhydride, and quantified using cryofocused 2-dimensional GC/MS operated in electron-impact selected ion-monitoring mode. RESULTS: Limits of quantification were 1.0 μg/L for MDA and 2.5 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, HMMA, and HMA. Calibration curves were linear to 100 μg/L for MDA and HMA and to 400 μg/L for MDEA, MDMA, and HMMA, with r2 > 0.997. At 3 concentrations spanning the linear dynamic range of the assay, mean overall extraction efficiencies from plasma were ≥85% for all compounds of interest. Recoveries were 85.6% to 107.2% of target, and intra- and interassay imprecision (CV) was <8.5% for all drugs at 3 concentrations within the range of the assay. None of the 66 exogenous compounds tested interfered with analyte quantification. CONCLUSIONS: This GC/MS assay provides low limits of quantification for simultaneous determination of MDEA, MDMA, and metabolites MDA, HMMA, and HMA in human plasma. The 2D chromatographic system should be suitable for application to other analytes and to other complex matrices. © 2007 American Association for Clinical Chemistry."
"1620","0","Nitrous oxide for TRD: preliminary findings.^\nBackground: Recently, NMDA receptor antagonists (e.g., ketamine) have demonstrated rapid antidepressant effects in treatment‐resistant depression (TRD) patients. Because nitrous oxide, an inhalational general anesthetic, is also an NMDA receptor antagonist, we hypothesized that nitrous oxide may be a rapidly acting treatment for TRD. Methods: Twenty TRD patients were enrolled in this randomized, placebo‐controlled crossover trial; each received a 1‐hour inhalation of up to 50% nitrous oxide/50% oxygen or 50% nitrogen/50% oxygen (placebo control) in random order. Primary endpoint was change on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HRDS‐21) 24 hours post‐treatment. Results: Mean duration of nitrous oxide treatment was 55.6 ± 2.5 (SD) minutes. In two patients nitrous oxide treatment was interrupted (subsequently resumed) and in three discontinued. Depressive symptoms improved significantly at 2 hours and 24 hours after receiving nitrous oxide compared to placebo (mean change HDRS‐21 score at 2 hours: ‐4.8 points, 95% CI ‐1.8 to ‐ 7.8 points, p= 0.002; at 24 hours: ‐5.5 points, 95% CI ‐2.5 to ‐8.5 points, p<0.001; comparison between nitrous oxide and placebo: p<0.001). Four patients (20%) had treatment response (≥50% HDRS reduction) and three patients (15%) remitted (HRDS ≤ 7 points) after nitrous oxide compared to one patient (5%) and none after placebo (odds ratio [OR] for response 4.0, 95% CI 0.45 ‐ 35.79; OR for remission 3.0, 95% CI 0.31 ‐ 28.8). All adverse events were brief and mild to moderate severity. Conclusions: This proof‐of‐concept trial demonstrated that nitrous oxide has rapid and marked antidepressant effects in patients with treatment‐resistant depression."
"481","0","Peroperative ketamine and morphine for postoperative pain control after lumbar disk surgery.^\nBackground: Ketamine, a N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor antagonist, may reduce postoperative opioid demand and improve postoperative analgesia. Methods: Sixty-nine patients scheduled for lumbar disk surgery under general anaesthesia were enrolled in a randomised, double-blind study comparing three analgesic combinations that were started before surgical incision: morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 alone (group M; n = 23); ketamine 0.15 mg kg-1 alone (group K; n = 22); and a combination of morphine 0.1 mg kg-1 with ketamine 0.15 mg kg-1 (group KM; n = 23). Postoperatively patient-controlled analgesia was provided with intravenous morphine. Morphine consumption was assessed during 24 H, and pain scores were measured using a visual analogue scale (VAS) at rest and on mobilisation, during the first two postoperative days. Results: In group KM, less i.v. morphine was administered in the post anaesthesia care unit than in group M (median [range]: 0 mg [0-2] vs. 7 mg [6-9], P = 0.009). Cumulative 24 H morphine consumption was reduced by 57% in group KM vs. group M, and by 48% in group KM vs. group K. Postoperative VAS scores were lower in group KM vs. groups K and M. Maximal VAS score on mobilization was reduced in group KM compared to groups K and M (38 mm [35-45] vs. 52 mm [48-59] and vs. 59 mm [55-64], in groups KM, K and M, respectively, P = 0.05 and P = 0.002). The incidence of postoperative nausea and vomiting was decreased in group KM compared to group M (21.7% vs. 43.5%, P = 0.001). Conclusion: Ketamine small-dose, combined with morphine improves postoperative analgesia and reduces opioid-related side effects in lumbar disk surgery.

Design and Participants: Multimodal survey conducted April to July 2004 consisting of 42 forced-choice response items. Participants were practicing physicians randomly selected from the national membership rolls of the American Academy of Pediatrics, Society of Adolescent Medicine, and American Academy of Family Physicians who provided care for 10 or more adolescents per week. We computed simple frequencies and sample design-adjusted 95% confidence intervals for each item. Results: The survey was completed by 359 eligible physicians ( response rate, 42%). More than 95% of respondents had ever ordered urine drug tests. Only 23% used an effective urine sample collection procedure, and only 7% used specific gravity and measurement of urine creatinine level to ensure validity of the sample, as recommended. When asked which drugs can be detected in routine panels, only 10% answered all items correctly, 47% did not know for 1 or more items, and 75% responded incorrectly for 1 or more items.

"6256","1","MDMA-Assisted CBCT for PTSD vs CBCT RCT.^\nThis study aims to evaluate the safety, feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of MDMA‐assisted Cognitive‐Behavioral Conjoint Therapy (CBCT) versus CBCT alone for the treatment of Post‐Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). PTSD is a debilitating condition that significantly impacts interpersonal relationships and the functioning of individuals and their loved ones. There is also a well‐established reciprocal relationship between interpersonal relationships, PTSD, and recovery. CBCT is a manualized treatment for PTSD that simultaneously addresses PTSD symptoms and relationship satisfaction. It provides dyads with behavioral tools to navigate PTSD‐related challenges, as well as the knowledge behind PTSD and how it impacts relationships. Previous research has demonstrated the efficacy of CBCT in improving PTSD symptoms, partner functioning, and relationship satisfaction in both distressed and non‐distressed dyads. MDMA is a drug commonly used recreationally that has been increasingly studied because of its ability to reduce the impact of PTSD symptoms. The effects of MDMA are reduced fear, enhanced communication, trust and introspection, and increased empathy and compassion. The effects of MDMA create a state that enhances the positive effects of therapy by increasing the ability to tolerate negative emotions and allowing clients to stay engaged in therapy without being overwhelmed by the intense emotions surrounding the memories of traumatic events. It is believed that MDMA may help promote the effects of CBCT due to its ability to induce empathy and interpersonal openness. This randomized study is the second study designed to explore the efficacy of combining MDMA‐assisted therapy with CBCT. This study will enroll 30 dyads, where one individual has symptoms of PTSD. Participants will undergo a 7‐week psychotherapy course, in MDMA‐assisted CBCT or CBCT alone. In the MDMA‐assisted CBCT, participants will go through CBCT sessions, and two doses of MDMA will be used as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Participants assigned to the CBCT‐only condition will go through CBCT sessions and will have the opportunity to crossover and receive the two MDMA sessions after follow‐up. The primary goal of this research is to contribute to the literature on MDMA‐assisted CBCT by investigating its feasibility, safety, acceptability, and effectiveness, and by comparing it to active PTSD treatments."
"788","0","Locomotor effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and its deuterated form in mice: Psychostimulant effects, stereotypy, and sensitization.^\nRationale: There is a renewed interest in the use of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) for treating psychiatric conditions. Although MDMA has entered phase II clinical trials and shows promise as an adjunct treatment, there is an extensive literature detailing the potential neurotoxicity and adverse neurobehavioral effects associated with MDMA use. Previous research indicates that the adverse effects of MDMA may be due to its metabolism into reactive catechols that can enter the brain and serve directly as neurotoxicants. One approach to mitigate MDMA’s potential for adverse effects is to reduce O-demethylation by deuterating the methylenedioxy ring of MDMA. There are no studies that have evaluated the effects of deuterating MDMA on behavioral outcomes. Objectives: The purpose of the present study was to assess the motor-stimulant effects of deuterated MDMA (d2-MDMA) and compare them to MDMA in male mice. Methods: Two experiments were performed to quantify mouse locomotor activity and to vary the drug administration regimen (single bolus administration or cumulative administration).ResultsThe results of Experiments 1 and 2 indicate that d2-MDMA is less effective at eliciting horizontal locomotion than MDMA; however, the differences between the compounds diminish as the number of cumulative administrations increase. Both d2-MDMA and MDMA can elicit sensitized responses, and these effects cross-sensitize to the prototypical drug of abuse methamphetamine. Thus, d2-MDMA functions as a locomotor stimulant similar to MDMA, but, depending on the dosing regimen, may be less susceptible to inducing sensitization to stereotyped movements. Conclusions: These findings indicate that d2-MDMA is behaviorally active and produces locomotor effects that are similar to MDMA, which warrant additional assessments of d2-MDMA’s behavioral and physiological effects to determine the conditions under which this compound may serve as a relatively safer alternative to MDMA for clinical use.

"9503","1","Co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against challenging experiences and enhance positive experiences.^\nPsilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) experiences can range from very positive to highly challenging (e.g., fear, grief, and paranoia). These challenging experiences contribute to hesitancy toward psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy among health care providers and patients. Co-use of 3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) with psilocybin/LSD anecdotally reduces challenging experiences and enhances positive experiences associated with psilocybin/LSD. However, limited research has investigated the acute effects of co-use of MDMA and psilocybin/LSD. In a prospective convenience sample (N = 698) of individuals with plans to use psilocybin/LSD, we examined whether co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (n = 27) is associated with differences in challenging or positive experiences. Challenging experiences were measured using the Challenging Experiences Questionnaire and positive experiences were measured using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and single-item measures of self-compassion, compassion, love, and gratitude. Potentially confounding variables were identified and included as covariates. Relative to psilocybin/LSD alone, co-use of psilocybin/LSD with a self-reported low (but not medium-high) dose of MDMA was associated with significantly less intense total challenging experiences, grief, and fear, as well as increased self-compassion, love and gratitude. Co-use of psilocybin/LSD and MDMA was not associated with differences in mystical-type experiences or compassion. Findings suggest co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against some aspects of challenging experiences and enhance certain positive experiences. Limitations include use of a convenience sample, small sample size, and non-experimental design. Additional studies (including controlled dose-response studies) that examine the effects and safety of co-administering MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (in healthy controls and clinical samples) are warranted and may assist the development of personalized treatments."

In this study, the active group will receive the psilocybin at weeks 5 and 9 and the wait‐list control group will receive psilocybin at weeks 30 and 34. The wait‐list control group serves the purpose of providing an untreated comparison for the active treatment group, while at the same time allowing the wait‐list participants an opportunity to obtain the intervention at a later date. This study's procedures include screening, preparatory meetings, psilocybin sessions, and follow‐up assessments. A large battery of behavioral and psychological measures will be assessed throughout. The study team will consent and enroll up to 86 subjects to obtain a total of 12 completer participants as well as 2‐3 family members or friends per study participant who can assess said completers on the Observer Rating Form (COM‐R). This number will account for screen‐failures and dropouts as well. The 12 participants will be randomly assigned to either an immediate participation group (N=6) or a 6‐month delayed participation group (N=6). Although statistical power calculations show that 12 participants will be sufficient to detect the major effects anticipated in this study, the sponsor of this study (The Council on Spiritual Practices) is concurrently funding Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine to conduct a methodologically identical study with 12 additional participants (IND #59009). This will permit the two sites to collaborate post study completion and combine the data from the two studies to provide statistical power to detect even more subtle effects of the psilocybin intervention.

"2354","0","Connecting inflammation with glutamate agonism in suicidality.^\nThe NMDA-receptor antagonist ketamine has proven efficient in reducing symptoms of suicidality, although the mechanisms explaining this effect have not been detailed in psychiatric patients. Recent evidence points towards a low-grade inflammation in brains of suicide victims. Inflammation leads to production of quinolinic acid (QUIN) and kynurenic acid (KYNA), an agonist and antagonist of the glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, respectively. We here measured QUIN and KYNA in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 64 medication-free suicide attempters and 36 controls, using gas chromatography mass spectrometry and high-performance liquid chromatography. We assessed the patients clinically using the Suicide Intent Scale and the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). We found that QUIN, but not KYNA, was significantly elevated in the CSF of suicide attempters (P<0.001). As predicted, the increase in QUIN was associated with higher levels of CSF interleukin-6. Moreover, QUIN levels correlated with the total scores on Suicide Intent Scale. There was a significant decrease of QUIN in patients who came for follow-up lumbar punctures within 6 months after the suicide attempt. In summary, we here present clinical evidence of increased QUIN in the CSF of suicide attempters. An increased QUIN/KYNA quotient speaks in favor of an overall NMDA-receptor stimulation. The correlation between QUIN and the Suicide Intent Scale indicates that changes in glutamatergic neurotransmission could be specifically linked to suicidality. Our findings have important implications for the detection and specific treatment of suicidal patients, and might explain the observed remedial effects of ketamine. © 2013 American College of Neuropsychopharmacology.

"2431","1","Default Mode Connectivity in Major Depressive Disorder Measured Up to 10 Days After Ketamine Administration.^\nBACKGROUND: The symptoms of major depressive disorder (MDD) are rapidly alleviated by administration of a single dose of the glutamatergic modulator ketamine. However, few studies have investigated the potential sustained neural effects of this agent beyond immediate infusion. This study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to examine the effect of a single ketamine infusion on the resting state default mode network (DMN) at 2 and 10 days after a single ketamine infusion in unmedicated subjects with MDD as well as healthy control subjects (HCs). METHODS: Data were drawn from a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of 58 participants (33 with MDD and 25 HCs) who received an intravenous infusion of either ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) or placebo on 2 separate test days spaced 2 weeks apart. Eight minutes of functional magnetic resonance imaging resting state data was acquired at baseline and at about 2 and 10 days after both infusions. The DMN was defined using seed-based correlation and was compared across groups and scans. RESULTS: In subjects with MDD, connectivity between the insula and the DMN was normalized compared with HCs 2 days postketamine infusion. This change was reversed after 10 days and did not appear in either of the placebo scans. Group-specific connectivity differences in drug response were observed, most notably in the insula in subjects with MDD and in the thalamus in HCs. CONCLUSIONS: Connectivity changes in the insula in subjects with MDD suggest that ketamine may normalize the interaction between the DMN and salience networks, supporting the triple network dysfunction model of MDD."
"9446","1","Sex differences in 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy)-induced cytochrome P450 2D6 inhibition in humans.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) is a ring-substituted amphetamine widely used for recreational purposes. MDMA is predominantly O-demethylenated in humans by cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 and is also a potent mechanism-based inhibitor of the enzyme. This study assessed the inhibition and recovery half-life of CYP2D6 and CYP3A4 activity in female subjects by administering the probe drug dextromethorphan before and repeatedly after MDMA administration. These data were compared with the data obtained from a previous study in male subjects. STUDY DESIGN: Twelve healthy female subjects who were CYP2D6 extensive metabolizers participated as outpatients in two experimental sessions. Session 1 was conducted over 2 days and session 2 over 10 days, with a minimum of 3 days between sessions. In session 1, subjects received a single oral dose of dextromethorphan 30 mg. In session 2, a 1.5 mg/kg MDMA dose was given at 0 hours, followed at 4 hours by repeated 30 mg doses of dextromethorphan over the next 10 days. METHODS: Plasma concentration-time profiles and urinary recoveries of dextromethorphan and its metabolites dextrorphan (DOR), 3-methoxymorphinan (MM) and hydroxymorphinan-3-ol (HM) were measured. RESULTS: MDMA given prior to dextromethorphan resulted in a 10-fold increase in the dextromethorphan maximum plasma concentration (C(max)) and area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC), with corresponding decreases in DOR and HM pharmacokinetic parameters. The mean ± SD C(max) of MDMA was 188.8 ± 16.7 ng/mL, with a time to reach C(max) (t(max)) of 2.0 ± 0.4 hours and an AUC from 0 to 25 hours of 2645.2 ± 170.9 mg · h/mL. The urinary recovery of the dextromethorphan dose as dextromethorphan and its main metabolites was 25.4 ± 8.9% with no MDMA pretreatment versus 6.6 ± 1.1% after 1.5 mg/kg of MDMA (p = 0.0001). The metabolic ratio (MR) increased almost 60-fold from 0.018 ± 0.028 to 0.998 ± 0.932 after MDMA administration, with 100% of the subjects having a value greater than the antimode of 0.3 that signified the poor-metabolizer phenotype. Data analysis of results obtained in the present study compared with those from a previous study in male subjects showed significant differences in the dextromethorphan/DOR MR in the 0- to 8-hour (session 1) and 4- to 12-hour (session 2, post MDMA) collection periods (p = 0.032 and p = 0.01, respectively). CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity, with a recovery half-life of 36.6 ± 22.9 hours. Male subjects showed a shorter recovery half-life (27.6 ± 25.1 hours). The measurement of CYP3A4 activity indicated a non-significant increase in C(max) and AUC values of MM after drug intake, but urinary data reflected significant differences in dextromethorphan/MM MR in both sexes, although the difference was more pronounced in women. Dextromethorphan/MM MR increased almost 3-fold from baseline. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION: In women the pretreatment with MDMA resulted in a decrease in dextromethorphan clearance. CYP2D6 activity recovered after 10 days to 90% of baseline activity. Regarding CYP3A4 activity, there is an apparent decrease in its activity after MDMA use. In women, MDMA use has been associated with psychiatric symptoms and psychological problems that may require psychopharmacological treatment with antidepressant drugs, some of which are known CYP2D6 substrates. MDMA-induced mechanism-based inhibition of CYP2D6 is of relevance, and physicians should be advised to prescribe medications whose metabolic disposition is not regulated by CYP2D6."
"7956","1","Side-effects associated with ketamine use in depression: a systematic review.^\nThis is the first systematic review of the safety of ketamine in the treatment of depression after single and repeated doses. We searched MEDLINE, PubMed, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Databases and identified 288 articles, 60 of which met the inclusion criteria. After acute dosing, psychiatric, psychotomimetic, cardiovascular, neurological, and other side-effects were more frequently reported after ketamine treatment than after placebo in patients with depresssion. Our findings suggest a selective reporting bias with limited assessment of long-term use and safety and after repeated dosing, despite these being reported in other patient groups exposed to ketamine (eg, those with chronic pain) and in recreational users. We recommend large-scale clinical trials that include multiple doses of ketamine and long-term follow up to assess the safety of long-term regular use."
"9059","0","Translational findings linking poor inhibitory control and heightened drug reward sensitivity.^\nPoor inhibitory control and heightened sensitivity to drug reward are two well-established risk factors for substance use disorders. Although these risk factors have traditionally been studied independently, there is reason to expect they may be related at the neurobiological level. Here, translational studies investigating the association between poor inhibition and greater drug reward sensitivity in both laboratory animals and humans are reviewed. Findings show that in animals, inhibitory deficits are associated with greater self-administration of cocaine, nicotine, 3,4-methylenedioxy-methamphetamine (MDMA), and alcohol, but not heroin. Likewise, in healthy human volunteers, poor inhibitory control and less brain engagement in right frontal regions during inhibition are associated with greater and more positive subjective responses to amphetamine and alcohol. The potential neurobiological mechanisms underlying this association are discussed, including the number or function of striatal dopamine D₂ receptors, as well as the implications of the findings and directions for future research.

"1029","0","Associations of alternative cannabis product use and poly-use with subsequent illicit drug use initiation during adolescence.^\nRationale: Specific cannabis products may differentially increase risk of initiating non-cannabis illicit drug use during adolescence. Objective: To determine whether ever- and poly-use of smoked, vaporized, edible, concentrate, or blunt cannabis products are associated with subsequent initiation of non-cannabis illicit drug use. Methods: High school students from Los Angeles completed in-classroom surveys. The analytic sample (N = 2163; 53.9% female; 43.5% Hispanic/Latino; baseline M age = 17.1 years) included students who reported never using illicit drugs at baseline (spring, 11th grade) and provided data at follow-up (fall and spring, 12th grade). Logistic regression models assessed associations between use of smoked, vaporized, edible, concentrate, and blunt cannabis at baseline (yes/no for each product) and any non-cannabis illicit drug use initiation—including cocaine, methamphetamine, psychedelics, ecstasy, heroin, prescription opioids, or benzodiazepines—at follow-up. Results: Among those who never used non-cannabis illicit drugs at baseline, ever cannabis use varied by cannabis product (smoked = 25.8%, edible = 17.5%, vaporized = 8.4%, concentrates = 3.9%, and blunts = 18.2%) and patterns of use (single product use = 8.2% and poly-product use = 21.8%). After adjustment for baseline covariates, odds of illicit drug use at follow-up were largest for baseline ever users of concentrates (aOR [95% CI] = 5.74[3.16–10.43]), followed by vaporized (aOR [95% CI] = 3.11 [2.41–4.01]), edibles (aOR [95% CI] = 3.43 [2.32–5.08]), blunts (aOR [95% CI] = 2.66[1.60–4.41]), and smoked (aOR [95% CI] = 2.57 [1.64–4.02]) cannabis. Ever use of a single product (aOR [95% CI] = 2.34 [1.26–4.34]) or 2 + products (aOR [95% CI] = 3.82 [2.73–5.35]) were also associated with greater odds of illicit drug initiation. Conclusions: For each of five different cannabis products, cannabis use was associated with greater odds of subsequent illicit drug use initiation, especially for cannabis concentrate and poly-product use."
"3336","1","Residual neuropsychological effects of illicit 3,4- methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) in individuals with minimal exposure to other drugs.^\nBackground: A substantial literature suggests that users of illicit 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") display residual cognitive deficits. Most MDMA users, however, use other illicit drugs as well, so it is difficult to be certain that these deficits are due to MDMA, as opposed to other drug use or additional confounding factors. Methods: We administered a battery of neuropsychological tests to 23 young MDMA users who reported minimal exposure to any other drugs, including alcohol, and to 16 comparison individuals equally involved with the rave subculture, but reporting no MDMA use. We compared the groups by regression analyses adjusting for numerous potentially confounding variables. To test for a possible dose-response effect, we also performed a median split of 12 moderate MDMA users (22-50 lifetime uses) and 11 heavy users (60-450 uses), and compared these subgroups with non-users. Results: MDMA users as a whole performed worse than non-users on most test measures, but these comparisons rarely reached statistical significance. This picture changed markedly in the subgroup analysis: although moderate users displayed virtually no differences from non-users on any measures, the heavy users displayed significant deficits on many measures, particularly those associated with mental processing speed and impulsivity. These differences did not appear explainable by differences in family-of-origin variables, verbal IQ, levels of depression, or time since last MDMA use. Conclusions: The presence of residual cognitive deficits, even among unusually ""pure"" frequent users of illicit MDMA, analyzed with adjustment for confounding variables, augments the evidence that MDMA itself, rather than some associated factor, is responsible for the deficits observed. © 2004 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"8343","1","Psychometric evaluation of the altered states of consciousness rating scale (OAV).^\nBACKGROUND: The OAV questionnaire has been developed to integrate research on altered states of consciousness (ASC). It measures three primary and one secondary dimensions of ASC that are hypothesized to be invariant across ASC induction methods. The OAV rating scale has been in use for more than 20 years and applied internationally in a broad range of research fields, yet its factorial structure has never been tested by structural equation modeling techniques and its psychometric properties have never been examined in large samples of experimentally induced ASC. METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: The present study conducted a psychometric evaluation of the OAV in a sample of psilocybin (n = 327), ketamine (n = 162), and MDMA (n = 102) induced ASC that was obtained by pooling data from 43 experimental studies. The factorial structure was examined by confirmatory factor analysis, exploratory structural equation modeling, hierarchical item clustering (ICLUST), and multiple indicators multiple causes (MIMIC) modeling. The originally proposed model did not fit the data well even if zero-constraints on non-target factor loadings and residual correlations were relaxed. Furthermore, ICLUST suggested that the ""oceanic boundlessness"" and ""visionary restructuralization"" factors could be combined on a high level of the construct hierarchy. However, because these factors were multidimensional, we extracted and examined 11 new lower order factors. MIMIC modeling indicated that these factors were highly measurement invariant across drugs, settings, questionnaire versions, and sexes. The new factors were also demonstrated to have improved homogeneities, satisfactory reliabilities, discriminant and convergent validities, and to differentiate well among the three drug groups. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: The original scales of the OAV were shown to be multidimensional constructs. Eleven new lower order scales were constructed and demonstrated to have desirable psychometric properties. The new lower order scales are most likely better suited to assess drug induced ASC."
"3171","0","A comparison of fenfluramine and amphetamine in man.^\ndl-Fenfluramine hydrochloride (60, 120, 240 mg), d-amphetamine sulfate (20, 40 mg), and placebo were compared in 8 postaddict volunteers, each dose given orally in random sequence at weekly intervals using a double-blind crossover design. Fenfluramine had little effect on blood pressure and temperature, but caused a marked dilation of pupils, whereas amphetamine was a potent vasopressor and a weak mydriatic. While fenfluramine produced euphoria in some subjects, its overall effects were unpleasant, sedative, and qualitatively different from amphetamine. Three subjects given 240 mg of fenfluramine experienced brief but vivid hallucinogenic episodes characterized by olfactory, visual, and somatic hallucinations, abrupt polar changes in mood, time distortion, fleeting paranoia, and sexual ideation. These observations indicate that fenfluramine is a hallucinogenic agent with a pharmacologic profile in man that is not amphetamine-like."
"2504","0","Oral clonazepam versus lorazepam in the treatment of methamphetamine-poisoned children: a pilot clinical trial.^\nObjectives To evaluate the efficacy of oral clonazepam versus oral lorazepam following initial parenteral benzodiazepine administration to control methamphetamine-induced agitation in children. Methods In a single-center clinical trial, intravenous diazepam (0.2 mg/Kg) was initially administered to all methamphetamine-poisoned pediatric patients to control their agitation, followed by a single dose of oral clonazepam (0.05 mg/Kg; n = 15) or oral lorazepam (0.05 mg/Kg; n = 15) to prevent relapse of toxicity. Results The median age [IQR] (range) was 15 [10, 36] (6-144) months. The source of poisoning was methamphetamine exposure from oral ingestion in 23 (76.7%) and passive inhalation in 7 (23.3%) patients. The most common symptoms/signs were agitation (29; 96.7%), mydriatic pupils (26; 86.7%), and tachycardia (20; 66.6%). Two in each group (13.3%) needed re-administration of intravenous diazepam due to persistent agitation. There was no report of benzodiazepine complications in either group. Conclusions Clonazepam and lorazepam treatment was equally effective at similar doses. However, considering the higher potency of clonazepam, it seems that lorazepam is the safer benzodiazepine for oral maintenance treatment of methamphetamine-induced agitation in children and can be used with minimal complications."

"4063","1","Time course of pharmacokinetic and hormonal effects of inhaled high-dose salvinorin A in humans.^\nSalvinorin A is a kappa opioid agonist and the principal psychoactive constituent of the Salvia divinorum plant, which has been used for hallucinogenic effects. Previous research on salvinorin A pharmacokinetics likely underestimated plasma levels typically resulting from the doses administered due to inefficient vaporization and not collecting samples during peak drug effects. Six healthy adults inhaled a single high dose of vaporized salvinorin A (n = 4, 21 mcg/kg; n = 2, 18 mcg/kg). Participant- and monitor-rated effects were assessed every 2 min for 60 min post-inhalation. Blood samples were collected at 13 time points up to 90 min post-inhalation. Drug levels peaked at 2 min and then rapidly decreased. Drug levels were significantly, positively correlated with participant and monitor drug effect ratings. Significant elevations in prolactin were observed beginning 5 min post-inhalation and peaking at 15 min post-inhalation. Cortisol showed inconsistent increases across participants. Hormonal responses were not well correlated with drug levels. This is the first study to demonstrate a direct relationship between changes in plasma levels of salvinorin A and drug effects in humans. The results confirm the efficacy of an inhalation technique for salvinorin A."
"2646","0","Ethnoracial health disparities and the ethnopsychopharmacology of psychedelic-assisted psychotherapies.^\nEmerging evidence from randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials suggests psychedelic compounds such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), psilocybin, and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), when administered as an adjunct to psychotherapy, that is, psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy (PAP), may be beneficial for treating substance use disorders, posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, anxiety, and other psychiatric conditions. Previous ethnopsychopharmacological research has identified ethnoracial differences in the metabolism, safety, and efficacy of psychotropic drugs, yet no studies have directly investigated the impact of ethnoracially based differences in psychedelic drug pharmacology. Although there is an extensive global history of psychedelic use among peoples of various cultures, ethnicities, and intersectional identities, psychedelic research has been conducted almost exclusively on White populations in North America and Western Europe. The failure to include Black, Indigenous, and People of Color (BIPOC) in psychedelic research trials neglects the ethnic, racial, and cultural factors that may impact individual responses to PAP and thereby prevents generalizability of findings. This article investigates the impact of biological and social factors related to culture, ethnicity, and race on pharmacological responses to PAP, as well as clinical outcomes. The limitations of ethnopsychopharmacology are discussed, and the authors present expected cultural, clinical, and public health benefits of expanding funding for this area. This work will draw attention to the unique and individualized needs of ethnoracially diverse clients in therapeutic settings and is intended to inform future PAP trials.

"3779","1","Effects of the α₂-adrenergic agonist clonidine on the pharmacodynamics and pharmacokinetics of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in healthy volunteers.^\nThe mechanism of action of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) involves the carrier-mediated and potentially vesicular release of monoamines. We assessed the effects of the sympatholytic α₂-adrenergic receptor agonist clonidine (150 μg p.o.), which inhibits the neuronal vesicular release of norepinephrine, on the cardiovascular and psychotropic response to MDMA (125 mg p.o.) in 16 healthy subjects. The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover design with four experimental sessions. The administration of clonidine 1 h before MDMA reduced the MDMA-induced increases in plasma norepinephrine concentrations and blood pressure but only to the extent that clonidine lowered norepinephrine levels and blood pressure compared with placebo. Thus, no interaction was found between the cardiovascular effects of the two drugs. Clonidine did not affect the psychotropic effects or pharmacokinetics of MDMA. The lack of an interaction of the effects of clonidine and MDMA indicates that vesicular release of norepinephrine, which is inhibited by clonidine, does not critically contribute to the effects of MDMA in humans. Although clonidine may be used in the treatment of stimulant-induced hypertensive reactions, the present findings do not support a role for α₂-adrenergic receptor agonists in the prevention of psychostimulant dependence."
"7223","1","Pretreatment functional neuroimaging correlates of antidepressant response to ketamine.^\nBackground: In major depressive disorder (MDD) there are multiple treatment options, each of which may be effective for some patients but not for others. Predicting whether a specific treatment will be beneficial in reducing depressive symptoms for a particular patient is difficult, and identifying measurable biological markers, or biomarkers, that could be assessed in individuals to help identify an effective treatment would be valuable. Previous research has used neuroimaging measures at baseline to test for potential correlations with treatment response in depression. Neural biomarkers of response may be challenging to identify for most pharmacological treatments for MDD, due to the length of time it takes for many antidepressants to show effects (potentially several weeks). The rapid antidepressant effects of ketamine, a glutamatergic modulator, make this compound well‐suited for investigating biomarkers that correlate with treatment response. We examined blood‐oxygen‐level dependent (BOLD) signal using functional MRI (fMRI) during an emotional processing task in patients with MDD to determine if pretreatment activation correlated with subsequent antidepressant response after ketamine. Methods: Participants included 31 patients with MDD, ages 18 to 65, who took part in this study as part of a large doubleblind placebo‐controlled protocol on the mechanism of action of ketamine. Depressive symptoms were rated using the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) before and after participants received an infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). At baseline, BOLD signal was measured using a 3T GE fMRI scanner during an emotional processing task. In this mixed block/event‐related task, participants viewed faces with emotional expressions (angry, sad, neutral, and happy), randomly presented either rightside up or upside‐down. Participants were instructed to press a button to judge the emotion in one block and to identify the gender in the other block. The fMRI data were processed and analyzed using AFNI. Preprocessing included despiking, aligning images, registering echo‐planar to structural images, blurring to 6 mm, normalizing, and motion correction. Firstlevel individual analyses were conducted using regressors for each stimulus and block type. Group analysis used a multivariate model with the task factors and with a quantitative variable for the percent change in MADRS score from baseline to one day after the ketamine infusion. Results were thresholded at p<0.05, family wise error corrected (with voxel‐wise p<0.01). Results: We found a significant correlation between BOLD signal during the emotional processing task at baseline and percent change in MADRS score after ketamine. This was found in a large cluster in the left insula, extending into left inferior and middle frontal gyri, as well as in a cluster in the right precuneus. For both regions, greater activation at baseline was associated with better antidepressant response to ketamine (decrease in MADRS score of depressive symptoms). This was found across the entire task, not related to any specific task factors. We did not find any brain areas that showed the opposite pattern of greater activation correlating with poorer response. Conclusions: Our findings showed that pretreatment brain activity was correlated with response to ketamine, with the most significant result found in the left insula. The insula plays a role in emotional processing and has been previously associated with neuroimaging findings related to depression. While prior research has shown some associations between insula activation and response to other medications, there have been mixed findings. This could be related to different tasks being used or differential response depending on the specific treatment. Using functional neuroimaging as a biomarker to predict the likelihood of antidepressant response to ketamine would be greatly beneficial for patients with MDD. This would also be a valuable way for clinicians to work towards individualized treatment for psychiatric il ness."
"6868","1","Careers in ecstasy use: Do ecstasy users cease of their own accord? Implications for intervention development.^\nBackground. Ecstasy (MDMA, 3, 4-methylenodioxymethamphetamine) use is widespread in the Netherlands, with a lifetime prevalence of 4.3%, and two-thirds of dance party visitors being ecstasy users. However, research into Dutch ecstasy use patterns is lacking. In addition, recent studies suggest that ecstasy users cease their use automatically, which implies that interventions would do better to better focus on the promotion of harm reduction strategies than on inducing cessation. The current study addresses this process of ecstasy cessation. Methods. 32 participants from the Dutch dance scene were interviewed, and the results were systematically analysed using NVivo. Results. Most ecstasy users had started to use out of curiosity. During use, users applied a host of harm reduction strategies, albeit inconsistently and sometimes incorrectly. Most users appeared to cease ecstasy use automatically because of loss of interest or changing life circumstances (e.g. a new job or relationship). Conclusion. It appears that cessation of ecstasy use is largely determined by environmental variables and not by health concerns. This supports the idea that health promotion resources are better spent in trying to promote consistent and correct application of harm reduction practices than in trying to induce cessation. © 2008 Peters et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd."
"2927","1","Long-lasting effects of (±)3,4-methylene-dioxymethamphetamine (Ecstasy) on serotonin system function in humans.^\nBackground: Fifteen (±)3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users, who did not show other drug dependencies or prolonged alcohol abuse, and 15 control subjects were included in the study. Methods: Prolactin (PRL) and cortisol (CORT) responses to the serotonergic agonist d-fenfluramine (D-fen), clinical psychobehavioral changes, and psychometric measures were evaluated 3 weeks and then 12 months after MDMA discontinuation. Results: MDMA users showed significantly reduced PRL and CORT responses in comparison with control subjects at 3 weeks (respectively, p < .001; p < .005). The responses of PRL to D-fen were unmodified at 12 months after prolonged abstinence and were significantly reduced in comparison with controls (p < .001). In contrast, CORT responses in MDMA users were restored after 12 months of abstinence, with significantly higher responses to D-fen, in comparison with 3-week responses (p < .05). MDMA users' high scores on the Novelty Seeking (NS) scale on the Tridimensional Personality Questionnaire (TPQ) appeared unchanged by long-term abstinence. In contrast, Buss Durkee Hostility Inventory (BDHI) (Buss and Durkee 1957) direct and guilt scores decreased significantly after 12 months of abstinence. PRL AUCs at 12 months were inversely correlated with the measures of MDMA exposure (r = -.538). Conclusions: Our data indicate long-lasting 5-HT system impairment in abstinent MDMA users although the hypothesis of serotonergic changes attributable to a premorbid condition cannot be excluded. CORT restored responses to D-fen at 12 months, and the correlation of neuroendocrine changes with MDMA exposure suggest that the neuroendocrine impairment may be due to a partially reversible neurotoxic action of MDMA on the human brain.

"2477","1","The effects of esketamine and treatment expectation in acute major depressive disorder (Expect): study protocol for a pharmacological fMRI study using a balanced placebo design.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a highly prevalent (8-15%), severely disabling disorder and is associated with enormous socioeconomic impact. Antidepressant medication for the treatment of MDD has proven effective in RCTs; however, placebo response is also substantial. Given the potential benefits of modulating the placebo response in patient care and pharmacological research, understanding the mechanisms underlying placebo response is of high clinical relevance. The placebo response is mediated by treatment expectation, i.e. an individual's belief about whether and how much they will improve as a consequence of their treatment. The mechanisms and moderators of treatment expectation effects in MDD are poorly understood. Initial brain imaging studies on placebo responses in MDD point towards the relevance of the lateral prefrontal cortex and the rostral anterior cingulate cortex (rACC). In this project, we will investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of treatment expectation associated with the fast-acting antidepressant esketamine in patients with MDD. Esketamine is an NMDA receptor antagonist inducing antidepressant effects within hours. METHODS: We will employ a fully balanced placebo design with the factors ""treatment"" (i.v. esketamine / placebo) and verbally induced ""expectation"" (high / low) combined with fMRI (resting state, emotion and reward processing paradigms) to investigate the psychological and neural mechanisms underlying the antidepressant effects of expectation, and how these interact with the pharmacological effects of esketamine. DISCUSSION: The insights gained by this project promise fundamental implications for clinical treatment and future drug trials. Unraveling the mechanisms underlying expectation effects on antidepressant treatment may inform (1) strategies to modulate these effects and thus improve assay sensitivity in RCTs and (2) novel treatment regiments aiming to maximize the synergistic effects of expectation and pharmacological treatment in the clinical care of patients with MDD. TRIAL REGISTRATION: This trial has been prospectively registered with the EU Clinical Trials Register: EudraCT-No.: 2020-000784-23 (November 17, 2020)."
"7860","1","Debunking the myth of 'Blue Mondays': No evidence of affect drop after taking clinical MDMA.^\nBACKGROUND: Incorporating 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as an adjunct to psychotherapy has shown promise in recent years for treating various mental health conditions, particularly those involving trauma. However, concerns about declines in mood and cognition during the days following dosing, also known as 'Blue Mondays', have been raised as limitations to its clinical use. Although these changes have been well-documented among recreational users, there are critical confounds to these reports that limit generalizability to clinically administered MDMA. AIMS: Here, we aimed to evaluate the evidence basis for the negative side effects associated with MDMA as well as inform our understanding of the drug's post-acute effects in a clinical context with an open-label study. METHODS: The current open-label study examined MDMA therapy for alcohol use disorder (AUD; N = 14) and measured mood, sleep quality, illicit MDMA consumption and anecdotal reports after the acute drug effects had worn off. RESULTS: Participants maintained a positive mood during the week following drug administration in a clinical context. Relative to baseline, self-reported sleep quality improved at the 3- and 6-month follow-ups. Finally, no participants reported using or desiring to use illicit MDMA, and the anecdotal reports indicated that they perceived the treatment favourably. CONCLUSION: The results support the overall safety and tolerability of clinically administered MDMA and, importantly, suggest that the 'come downs' previously associated with the substance may be explained by confounds in research relating to the illicit sourcing of the drug and specific environmental setting for recreational consumption."
"8704","1","Harm related to recreational ketamine use and its relevance for the clinical use of ketamine. A systematic review and comparison study.^\nBACKGROUNDS: Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic that is currently considered for several new indications. AIM: To deduce the safety of long-term ketamine treatment using the harm of heavy recreational (non-medical) ketamine use as a proxy for maximal possible harm of ketamine treatment. METHODS: Systematic literature review according to PRISMA guidelines to identify controlled studies on ketamine-related harm in heavy recreational ketamine users. Results were compared with serious adverse events (SAEs) in patients treated with ketamine according to three systematic reviews considering dosing regimen and cumulative dose. RESULTS: The systematic search yielded 25 studies. Heavy recreational ketamine use can escalate to ketamine dependency and was often dose-dependently associated with other SAEs, including cognitive and mental disorders, and gastrointestinal and urinary tract symptoms, which disappeared upon marked reduction of ketamine use. Heavy ketamine users have a much higher cumulative exposure to ketamine than ketamine treated patients (>90 times), which may explain why SAEs in the clinical context are mostly mild and reversible and why ketamine dependence was not reported in these patients. CONCLUSION: Treatment of patients with ketamine is not associated with ketamine dependency or SAEs. However, caution is needed since data on long-term clinical ketamine use with a long-term follow-up is lacking."
"554","0","Tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) predicts escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking in rats.^\nPre-clinical studies of individual differences in addiction vulnerability have been increasing over recent years, but the amphetamine derivative 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) has received relatively little attention in this regard. Previously, we reported large individual differences both in rats' initial behavioral response to experimenter-administered MDMA and their degree of behavioral sensitization to repeated administration. To determine whether these differences could predict subsequent patterns of MDMA-taking or -seeking behaviors we used the self-administration-extinction-reinstatement model to examine addiction-like behavior (i.e., escalation of MDMA self-administration and cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking) in rats a priori characterized for either locomotor sensitization or tolerance to MDMA. Rats that developed tolerance to the locomotor-activating effects of MDMA had a significantly larger locomotor response to the first MDMA injection relative to rats that developed sensitization. Importantly, rats that developed tolerance subsequently displayed an escalation of MDMA self-administration over days, as well as clear cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking following extinction. Conversely, rats that developed locomotor sensitization to MDMA subsequently maintained relatively stable levels of MDMA self-administration over days and showed no cue-induced reinstatement of MDMA seeking. These results show that differences in the level of psychomotor activation following acute and repeated MDMA administration can reliably predict two important addiction-like behaviors in rats, which may have implications in the prediction of compulsive MDMA use in humans.

"1135","1","Subacute effects of a single dose of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans: An open-label preliminary investigation.^\nRATIONALE: Psilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic that has gained prominent attention recently as a potential therapeutic for neuropsychiatric disorders including Major Depressive Disorder. Pre-clinical and initial studies in humans suggest that serotonin 2A receptor agonists, including serotonergic psychedelics, have anti-inflammatory effects. This may contribute to its therapeutic effects as previous studies indicate a link between neuropsychiatric disorders and inflammatory processes. However, the effect of psilocybin on biomarkers of inflammation has not been evaluated in humans. OBJECTIVES: Investigate the effect of a single dose of psilocybin on peripheral biomarkers of inflammation in healthy humans. METHODS: Blood samples were collected from 16 healthy participants before and one day after the administration of a single oral dose of psilocybin (mean dose: 0.22 mg/kg) and subsequently analyzed for concentrations of high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), tumor-necrosis-factor (TNF) and soluble urokinase plasminogen activator receptor (suPAR). Change in inflammatory markers was evaluated using a paired t-test where p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: We did not observe statistically significant changes in any of the above biomarkers of inflammation (all Cohen's d ≤ 0.31; all p ≥ 0.23). CONCLUSIONS: Our data do not support that a single dose of psilocybin reduces biomarkers of inflammation in healthy individuals one day after administration. Nevertheless, we suggest that future studies consider additional markers of inflammation, including markers of neuroinflammation, and evaluate potential anti-inflammatory effects of psilocybin therapy in clinical cohorts where more prominent effects may be observable."
"8110","1","Patterns of polydrug use in Great Britain: Findings from a national household population survey.^\nBackground: Polydrug use potentially increases the likelihood of harm. As little is known about polydrug use patterns in the general population, it is difficult to determine patterns associated with highest likelihood. Methods: Latent class analysis was performed on nine illicit substance groups indicating past year use of cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, ecstasy, LSD, mushrooms, amyl nitrate, tranquillisers and heroin or crack. Analyses were based on data from a large multi-stage probability sample of the population of Great Britain (n= 8538) collected in 2000. Multinomial logistic regression was performed highlighting associations between classes, and demographic and mental health variables. Results: A three class solution best described patterns of polydrug use; wide range, moderate range, and no polydrug use. For males and young people, there was a significantly increased chance of being in the wide and moderate range polydrug use groups compared to the no polydrug use class. Hazardous drinking was more likely in the wide and moderate polydrug classes with odds ratios of 9.99 and 2.38 (respectively) compared to the no polydrug use class. Current smokers were more likely to be wide and moderate range polydrug users compared to the no polydrug use class with odds ratios of 4.53 and 5.85 respectively. A range of mental health variables were also related to class membership. Conclusions: Polydrug use in Great Britain can be expressed as three distinct classes. Hazardous alcohol use and tobacco use were strongly associated with illicit polydrug use, polydrug use appeared to be significantly associated with mental health, particularly lifetime suicide attempts. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
"2347","0","Non-ETOH drug use among women in outpatient treatment for alcohol dependence.^\nAims: Gender differences in alcohol use disorders have led to the development of female specific treatments, but it is unclear if other drugs should be targeted in this sample as well. This study examined drug use lifetime patterns and in relation to drinking before and during treatment for alcohol dependent (AD) women. Methods: 182 AD women completed an intake and 155 with no current psychotic symptoms or physiological dependence on other drugs were randomized to 12‐sessions of individual or group CBT. Mean age was 49, income $85K, 89% Caucasian, 57% employed, and 48% married. Mean percent days drinking (PDD) and mean drinks per drinking day (MDPDD) pre‐treatment were 66% and 7.3. Results: Among the 87% of women with lifetime use of at least one illicit drug class, including: 12% sedatives, 83% cannabis, 24% stimulants, 16% opioids, 50% cocaine, 30% hallucinogens. 80% of women reported lifetime use of nicotine. Mean age of heaviest lifetime use ranged from 20 to 31 across drug classes. At intake, 27 women had used at least one illicit drug class in the past month. Users of cannabis (n = 26) or cocaine (n = 10) in the past year drank less frequently (cannabis, t = 2.3, p < .05; cocaine, t = 3.32, p < .01) but at higher quantities (cannabis, t =‐2.2, p < .05; cocaine, t =‐3.8, p < .001) at baseline than nonusers. Daily smokers reported higher baseline MDPDD than intermittent smokers. Cannabis use in the past year was associated with less reduction in PDD during treatment (F = 8.2, p < .01). Use of any illicit drug in the month prior to treatment entry was associated with less reduction in PDD (F = 10.2, p < .01) and quantity (F = 10.0, p < .01) during treatment. Conclusions: This sample of women seeking treatment for AD reported substantial lifetime use of non‐ETOH drugs that was associated with higher drinking intensity at baseline and poorer response to treatment for drinking, providing support for consideration of illicit drug or nicotine use in development of alcohol treatments for women."
"296","0","Psilocybin sex-dependently reduces alcohol consumption in C57BL/6J mice.^\nThe classical psychedelic psilocybin is of interest as a treatment for alcohol use disorder (AUD). This study investigated the effects of psilocybin on voluntary ethanol consumption in adult male and female C57BL/6J mice administered saline or psilocybin intraperitoneally as a single dose of 0.1, 0.5, 1.0 or 2.0 mg/kg and provided 20% ethanol utilizing a two-bottle choice alcohol drinking paradigm. Ethanol was provided continuously for 3 days immediately following the administration of psilocybin, then withheld for 2 days, and then provided continuously for two subsequent additional days. A multilevel model (MLM) for repeated measures was used to compare ethanol consumption and preference in psilocybin-treated groups versus controls. Ethanol consumption and preference were reduced in male mice during the 3-day interval that immediately followed psilocybin administration. The effect of psilocybin on ethanol consumption was dose-related and was consistent across the 3-day interval at dosages of 0.5 mg/kg or greater. Psilocybin had no effect on consumption or preference when ethanol was subsequently reintroduced after 2 days of withdrawal. In contrast to males, psilocybin had no significant effect on ethanol consumption or preference in female mice at any dosage or time point. The lack of an effect of psilocybin on quinine preference, and its limited interaction with locomotor activity indicated that the observed reduction in voluntary ethanol consumption was not attributable to altered taste perception or motor effects. Total fluid consumption was increased in males at some time points and psilocybin dosages and unchanged in females, and the absence of any decrease in either group at any time point indicated that the observed reduction in ethanol consumption was not mediated by nonspecific effects on consummatory behavior. The finding of a sex-dependent effect of psilocybin on ethanol consumption suggests that the C57BL/6J mouse may provide a useful experimental approach to modeling sex differences in vulnerability to AUD in addition to investigation of the neurobiological basis of the effect of classical psychedelics on alcohol drinking behavior."
"4643","1","MDMA intoxication and verbal memory performance: a placebo-controlled pharmaco-MRI study.^\nThe aim of the present study was to identify the neural substrate underlying memory impairment due to a single dose of MDMA (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) by means of pharmaco-MRI. Based on previous behavioral results it was hypothesized that this deficit could be attributed to a specific influence of MDMA on encoding. Fourteen Ecstasy users participated in this double-blind, placebo-controlled, within-subject study with two treatment conditions: MDMA (75 mg) and placebo. Memory performance was tested by means of a word learning task including two words lists, one addressing reading processes (control task, CWL) and a second (experimental task, EWL) addressing encoding and reading processes. Behavioral data showed that under the influence of MDMA, EWL performance was worse than placebo. Imaging data showed that Encoding was situated mainly in (pre)frontal, temporal and parietal areas. MDMA by Encoding interaction was situated in three areas: the left middle frontal gyrus (BA10), the right fusiform gyrus (BA19), and the left cuneus (BA18). Behavioral and functional data only correlated in BA10. It appeared that EWL performance caused BOLD signal change in BA10 during placebo treatment but not during MDMA intoxication. It is concluded that MDMA influences middle frontal gyrus processes resulting in impoverished memory encoding."
"9175","1","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Further study and optimization of this treatment approach in well-powered clinical trials is recommended."
"4215","0","Psilocybin in medicine and psychotherapy - an overview.^\nClassic psychedelics such as psilocybin or lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were intensively researched in the context of substance-assisted psychotherapy in the 1950s and 60s and were evaluated as promising for a broad spectrum of mental disorders. However, due to government restrictions, scientific research into the therapeutic application of these substances came to an early halt. After a nearly 50-year hiatus, psychedelic research has experienced a resurgence with a growing number of controlled clinical trials conducted according to current methodological standards. Results of modern clinical trials suggest the safety and efficacy of classic psychedelics such as psilocybin (along with LSD and ayahuasca) for various mental disorders, with the most advanced data on the safety and efficacy of psilocybin for depression. While the results of modern clinical trials are promising, further studies with larger numbers of cases over a longer observation period are needed, as well as comparisons with conventional antidepressant treatments. These will be essential in order to evaluate the effectiveness of this treatment approach and to achieve regulatory approval. In addition, the biological and psychotherapeutic mechanisms mediating the psychedelic and possibly antidepressant effects are only partially understood. This review presents the potential applications and treatment context of psilocybinassisted psychotherapy for depression."

"979","1","Evaluation of Early Ketamine Effects on Belief-Updating Biases in Patients With Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nIMPORTANCE: Clinical research has shown that persistent negative beliefs maintain depression and that subanesthetic ketamine infusions induce rapid antidepressant responses. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate whether ketamine alters belief updating and how such cognitive effects are associated with the clinical effects of ketamine. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: This study used an observational case-control protocol with a mixed-effects design that nested 2 groups by 2 testing time points. Observers were not blinded. Patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD) and healthy volunteer participants aged 34 to 68 years were included. Patients with TRD were diagnosed with major depressive disorder or bipolar depression, had a Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score greater than 20, a Maudsley Staging Method score greater than 7, and failed to respond to at least 2 prior antidepressant trials. Exclusion criteria were any other psychiatric, neurological, or neurosurgical comorbidities, substance use or addictive disorders, and recreational ketamine consumption. Data were collected from January to February 2019 and from May to December 2019, and data were analyzed from January 2020 to July 2021. EXPOSURES: Patients with TRD were observed 24 hours before single ketamine infusion, 4 hours after the infusion, and 4 hours after the third infusion, which was 1 week after the first infusion. Healthy control participants were observed twice 1 week apart without ketamine exposure. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale score and belief updating after belief updating when patients received good news and bad news measured by a cognitive belief-updating task and mathematically formalized by a computational reinforcement learning model. RESULTS: Of 56 included participants, 29 (52%) were male, and the mean (SEM) age was 52.3 (1.2) years. A total of 26 patients with TRD and 30 control participants were included. A significant group × testing time point × news valence interaction showed that patients with TRD updated their beliefs more after good than bad news following a single ketamine infusion (controlled for age and education: β = -0.91; 95% CI, -1.58 to -0.24; t216 = -2.67; P = .008) than controls. Computational modeling showed that this effect was associated with asymmetrical learning rates (LRs) after ketamine treatment (good news LRs after ketamine, 0.51 [SEM, 0.04]; bad news LRs after ketamine 0.36 [SEM, 0.03], t25 = 3.8; P < .001) and partially mediated early antidepressant responses (path a*b: β = -1.00 [SEM, 0.66]; t26 = -1.53; z = -1.98; P = .04). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings provide novel insights into the cognitive mechanisms of the action of ketamine in patients with TRD, with promising perspectives for augmented psychotherapy for individuals with mood disorders."
"941","1","Psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity: A scoping review.^\nBackground: Research on psilocybin has become increasingly popular during the current psychedelic renaissance, which began in the early 1990s. Psilocybin’s effects on mental health are promising and there are ongoing efforts to investigate its clinical implementation and its effects on cognition. Aims: The purpose of this study is to report trends in publications, methods, and findings from research examining the effects of psilocybin on cognition and creativity in adults. Methods: We conducted an Open Science Framework preregistered scoping review, guided by the JBI Manual for Evidence Synthesis, on literature pertaining to psilocybin’s effects on cognition and creativity. Results/outcomes: In the 42 included studies, psilocybin was primarily administered orally (83%) in a bodyweight-adjusted manner (74%) to healthy participants (90%). Of the few studies that explicitly reported safety outcomes (26%), only one reported serious adverse reactions. During the acute phase post-intake (i.e., minutes to hours), macrodoses tended to impair cognitive performance and creativity, whereas microdoses tended toward creative enhancement. The few macrodosing studies that included post-acute measures (i.e., 1–85 days) reported primarily null but some positive effects. Conclusions/interpretation: This scoping review identified a time-based variation of psilocybin macrodosing effects on cognition and creativity, in which impairment may be observed early post-intake but withdraw over time, and some positive effects may emerge afterward. These findings are limited by methodological concerns and inadequate assessment of long-term effects. We therefore recommend that future psilocybin research be conducted according to existing guidelines and include well-validated measures of cognition and creativity at multiple timepoints."
"2800","1","Visits to the emergency department due to ecstasy (MDMA) and amphetamine derivative consumption: Epidemiological, clinical and evolutional profile.^\nObjectives: To describe clinical and epidemiologic characteristics of emergency department visits related with ecstasy usage, determine the rate of re-visits of the patients and their related factors. Material and methods: The clinical histories of the patients coming to the Emergency Department for ecstasy-related problems were reviewed during 89 consecutive months in order to define the epidemiological and clinical profile. The computerized system of admission was used to study re-visits to the emergency department, reviewing the clinical history of the re-visits to see if they were related with drug consumption. Results: The study included 498 cases (71% male, mean age 26.5 years). The majority of the patients were attended on the weekend (66.6%) and at night (57%). Main complaints were anxiety or altered thoughts (32.8%), agitation (17.2%), impaired awareness level (7.2%) and convulsions or abnormal movements (5.6%). A total of 81% of the patients had consumed other substances besides ecstasy, mainly ethanol (53%), cocaine (36%) and gammahydroxibutirate (liquid ecstasy, 25%). Twenty six patients (5%) required admission to hospital (6 in the intensive care unit) and 4 died (0.8%). Fifteen percent of the patients were re-attended in the same ED for drug-related problems after a mean follow-up of 3 years, the new visit being more frequent during the first months. The need for an urgent psychiatric visit (OR: 6.3; 95% CI: 2.912.8) and hospital admission (OR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.58.4) during their first ED attendance were independently associated with a greater risk of re-attendance. Conclusions: Ecstasy consumption frequently leads to an ED visit, sometimes due to severe medical complications, and at least 15% of patients will need urgent care again for drug-related problems within the next 3 years. This likelihood increases along with increased severity of the index episode (need of psychiatric consultation or hospital admission). © 2009 ElsevierEspaña, S.L.Todoslosderechosreservados."
"5375","1","Intraoperative ketamine for prevention of depressive symptoms after major surgery in older adults: an international, multicentre, double-blind, randomised clinical trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a general anaesthetic with anti-depressant effects at subanaesthetic doses. We hypothesised that intraoperative administration of ketamine would prevent or mitigate postoperative depressive symptoms in surgical patients. METHODS: We conducted an international, randomised clinical trial testing the effects of intraoperative administration of ketamine [0.5 mg kg(-1) (Lo-K) or 1.0 mg kg(-1) (Hi-K)] vs control [saline placebo (P)] in patients ≥60 yr old undergoing major surgery with general anaesthesia. We administered the Patient Health Questionnaire-8 before the operation, on postoperative day (POD) 3 (primary outcome), and on POD30 to assess depressive symptoms, a secondary outcome of the original trial. RESULTS: There was no significant difference on POD3 in the proportion of patients with symptoms suggestive of depression between the placebo [23/156 (14.7%)] and combined ketamine (Lo-K plus Hi-K) [61/349 (17.5%)] groups [difference = -2.7%; 95% confidence interval (CI), 5.0% to -9.4%; P=0.446]. Of the total cohort, 9.6% (64/670; 95% CI, 7.6-12.0%) had symptoms suggestive of depression before operation, which increased to 16.6% (84/505; 95% CI, 13.6-20.1%) on POD3, and decreased to 11.9% (47/395; 95% CI, 9.1-15.5%) on POD30. Of the patients with depressive symptoms on POD3 and POD30, 51% and 49%, respectively, had no prior history of depression or depressive symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Major surgery is associated with new-onset symptoms suggestive of depression in patients ≥60 yr old. Intraoperative administration of subanaesthetic ketamine does not appear to prevent or improve depressive symptoms. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: NCT01690988."
"9003","0","Adolescent substance use behavior and suicidal behavior for boys and girls: a cross-sectional study by latent analysis approach.^\nBACKGROUND: Adolescent suicidal behavior may consist of different symptoms, including suicidal ideation, suicidal planning and suicidal attempts. Adolescent substance use behavior may contribute to adolescent suicidal behavior. However, research on the relationships between specific substance use and individual suicidal behavior is insufficient, as adolescents may not use only one substance or develop only one facet of suicidal behavior. Latent variables permit us to describe the relationships between clusters of related behaviors more accurately than studying the relationships between specific behaviors. Thus, the aim of this study was to explore how adolescent substance use behavior contributes to suicidal behavior using latent variables representing adolescent suicidal and substance use behaviors. METHOD: A total of 13,985 adolescents were recruited using a stratified random sampling strategy. The participants indicated whether they had experienced suicidal ideation, planning and attempts and reported their cigarette, alcohol, ketamine and MDMA use during the past year. Latent analysis was used to examine the relationship between substance use and suicidal behavior. RESULTS: Adolescents who used any one of the above substances exhibited more suicidal behavior. The results of latent variables analysis revealed that adolescent substance use contributed to suicidal behavior and that boys exhibited more severe substance use behavior than girls. However, there was no gender difference in the association between substance use and suicidal behavior. CONCLUSION: Substance use behavior in adolescents is related to more suicidal behavior. In addition, the contribution of substance use to suicidal behavior does not differ between genders."
"5125","1","Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method for the bioanalysis of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and its metabolites DMT-N-oxide and indole-3-acetic acid in human plasma.^\nThe indole alkaloid N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) induces psychedelic effects in humans. In addition to ceremonial and recreational use, DMT is subject to clinical investigations. Sensitive bioanalytical methods are required to assess the pharmacokinetics of DMT and its metabolites in human plasma. Here, a high performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) method for the quantification of DMT and its major metabolites indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) and DMT-N-oxide (DMT-NO) was developed and validated. As IAA is an endogenous component of human plasma, (13)C(6)-IAA was used to determine IAA concentrations. After simple protein precipitation with methanol, analytes were separated on a pentafluorophenyl column. A gradient consisting of 0.1% (v/v) formic acid in a methanol-water mixture was applied for analyte separation. The analytes were detected by positive electrospray ionization followed by multiple reaction monitoring. The calibration range of the assay was 0.25-250 ng/mL for DMT, 0.1-100 ng/mL for DMT-NO, and 25-25,000 ng/mL for (13)C(6)-IAA. The intra- and inter-assay accuracy was 93-113% for all analytes at all quality control levels, with coefficient of variation ≤ 11%. All analytes were stable under storage conditions relevant for the analysis of large batches of study samples. The validated method was capable of assessing pharmacokinetic (PK) parameters of DMT and its metabolites in study participants intravenously perfused with 1 mg/min DMT for 90 min. Overall, the developed method is easy-to-use, has a short run time, and qualifies for PK and metabolism studies of DMT in clinical settings."
"3320","0","Serotonin and serotonin receptors in hallucinogen action.^\nHallucinogens are a class of substances that induce profound changes in perception and cognition. A closely related drug, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA), produces euphoria and a feeling of empathy, with minimal sensory distortion. Both of these classes of substances produce their effects by interacting with the serotonergic system. This chapter will review the receptor interactions that contribute to the behavioral effects of serotonergic hallucinogens and MDMA. In rodents, the behavioral effects of hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and mescaline are primarily mediated by activation of 5-HT2A receptors. There is evidence, however, that 5-HT1A receptors, 5-HT2C receptors and dopamine receptors may play a secondary role. The molecular requirements for interaction of hallucinogens with the 5-HT2A receptor are well-defined on the basis of structure-activity relationships. By contrast with the hallucinogens, MDMA is a potent releaser of monoamines that has complex effects on serotonergic, dopaminergic and noradrenergic systems. In recent years, psilocybin and MDMA have been administered to human volunteers in controlled clinical trials. Human studies confirm that the 5-HT2A receptor plays a primary role in mediating the subjective effects of psilocybin, whereas the effects of MDMA are largely attributable to carrier-mediated release of serotonin. These findings emphasize the importance of clinical investigation of hallucinogenic drugs. Additionally, there is a growing consensus that these drugs are likely to show therapeutic efficacy in the treatment of certain psychiatric disorders.

"4574","1","Dissociation of ketamine effects on rule acquisition and rule implementation: possible relevance to NMDA receptor contributions to executive cognitive functions.^\nBACKGROUND: The demands of the Wisconsin Card Sorting Test (WCST) change with experience. This report contains two studies designed to examine N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor contributions to the executive components of WCST performance. These aspects of WCST performance figure more prominently in the initial completion of this task than in subsequent task repetitions in healthy populations. METHODS: In the first study, healthy subjects (n = 15) completed the WCST on two occasions separated by 1 week. In the second study, healthy subjects (n = 22) completed two test days spaced by approximately 1 week, during which, they completed the WCST and other assessments after administration of the NMDA antagonist ketamine (intravenous bolus 0.26 mg/kg followed by infusion of 0.65 mg/kg/hour) or matched placebo. RESULTS: In the first study, subjects reduced the number of total and perseverative errors with a single repetition of the WCST. In the second study, ketamine significantly increased the number of total errors and the number and percent of perseverative errors on the first, but not the second test day. Similarly, it reduced the number of category criteria met on the first, but not second test day. Ketamine also increased distractibility, impaired recall, produced psychosis, altered perception, and had effects resembling the negative symptoms of schizophrenia. However, only WCST performance showed order dependency. CONCLUSIONS: This order dependency further implicates NMDA receptors in executive cognitive functions associated with the frontal cortex."

An additional 50 ayahuasca users were interviewed in person. The data for this study represent ayahuasca experience based on more than 2,267 ceremonies. A comparison group of 46 people attending a Catholic spiritual retreat weekend also completed the After the Spiritual Experience Questionnaire. A factor analysis of this questionnaire yielded three factors: Joy in Life, Relationship to the Sacred and Toxic Feelings. Although the ayahuasca users had significantly higher scores on the first two factors, the two groups had modest mean differences indicating a similar response to two very different spiritual experiences. This key finding strongly supports the view that ayahuasca users are engaged in an authentic process as spiritual in nature as that of the retreatants. The qualitative data revealed that ayahuasca users reduced their alcohol intake, ate healthier diets, enjoyed improved mood and greater self-acceptance and felt more loving and compassionate in their relationships. Seventy-four percent of the ayahuasca users said they had a relationship with and received ongoing guidance and support from the spirit of ayahuasca. © Taylor & Francis Group, LLC."

Compared to alcohol, less is known about the effects of cannabis on driving and even less about their combined effects. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the combined and separate effects of ethanol and tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) on perceived ability to drive, subjective effects, and simulated driving. METHODS: In a within-subject (crossover), randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind, 2 × 2 design, the effects of oral THC (10 mg [dronabinol] or placebo) and low-dose intravenous ethanol (clamped at BAC 0.04% or placebo) on perceived ability to drive, simulated driving (standard deviation of lateral position [SDLP]), subjective effects (e.g., ""high""), and physiological effects (e.g., heart rate) were studied in healthy humans (n = 18). RESULTS: Subjects reported reductions in perceived ability to drive (THC < ethanol < combination) which persisted for ~ 6 h (placebo = ethanol, THC < combination). Ethanol and THC produced synergistic effects on heart rate, significant differences compared to either drug alone on perceived ability to drive and feeling states of intoxication (e.g., high), as well increases in SDLP compared to placebo. CONCLUSIONS: Perceived ability to drive is reduced under the influence of THC against the backdrop of blood alcohol levels that are below the legal limit. People should be aware that the effects of oral THC on driving may persist for up to six hours from administration. Findings are relevant to the increasingly common practice of combining alcohol and cannabinoids and the effects on driving."
"2277","1","Development and application of a highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for simultaneous quantification of N,N-dimethyltryptamine and two of its metabolites in human plasma.^\nA highly sensitive LC-MS/MS method for the quantification of N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and its metabolites indole-3-acetic acid and DMT N-oxide in human plasma has been developed and validated. Chromatography was performed using a diphenyl column with gradient elution (0.1% formic acid in methanol/water). The mass spectrometer was operated in multiple reaction monitoring mode. A methanolic solution containing internal standards 2-methylindole 3-acetic acid and deuterated DMT, was added to plasma samples, followed by protein precipitation with acetonitrile. The samples were centrifuged and supernatants transferred to new tubes and evaporated to dryness before reconstitution in aqueous mobile phase. The method was validated with regards to accuracy, precision, sensitivity, selectivity, recovery, matrix effects, stability, carry-over and dilution integrity. The validated linear range was 0.25-200 nM for DMT and 15-250 nM for DMT N-oxide. For the endogenous compound indole-3-acetic acid a different approach was taken due to its significant presence in blank samples. The change in signal response from a blank sample was used when constructing the calibration curve with linearity demonstrated between elevations of 500-5000 nM above the blank. Applicability of the described method was demonstrated through analysis of plasma samples from healthy volunteers having received intravenous injections of DMT. The presented method for rapid and sensitive quantification of DMT and its metabolites in human plasma can be applied to future studies aiming to characterize DMT disposition and its relationship to immediate psychedelic or long-term antidepressive effects."

The aim of this report was to study its metabolic disposition and the impact of genetic variation of CYP2D6 on MEPH metabolism, in a dose range compatible with its recreational use. A randomized, crossover, phase I clinical trial was performed. Subjects received 50 and 100 mg (n = 3) and 150 and 200 mg (n = 6) of mephedrone and were genetically and phenotypically characterized for the CYP2D6 allelic variation. Our results showed a linear kinetics of mephedrone at the dose range assayed: plasma concentrations, cardiovascular and subjective effects, and blood serotonin concentrations all correlated in a dose-dependent manner. Mephedrone metabolic disposition is mediated by CYP2D6. Mephedrone pharmacology presented a linear dose-dependence within the range of doses tested. The metabolism of mephedrone by CYP2D6 implies that recreational users with no or low CYP2D6 functionality are exposed to unwanted acute toxicity episodes."
"9331","1","The acute antisuicidal effects of single-dose intravenous ketamine and intranasal esketamine in individuals with major depression and bipolar disorders: A systematic review and meta-analysis.^\nThe efficacy of ketamine in reducing suicidal ideation (SI) has been previously reported. We aimed to evaluate acute anti-SI effects of single-dose ketamine in different formulations/routes of administration by pooling results from randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A systematic search was conducted on Cochrane, Embase, Medline, and PubMed from inception to July 1st, 2020. Studies were selected based on pre-determined eligibility criteria. Effect sizes of different formulations/routes at various time points were computed using random-effects models. With data from nine eligible RCTs (n = 197), the pooled effect size for anti-SI effects at the 24-h time point was 1.035 (N = 6, CI: 0.793 to 1.277, p < 0.001) for intravenous (IV) racemic ketamine and 1.309 (N = 1, CI: 0.857 to 1.761, p < 0.001) for intranasal (IN) esketamine. An additional five RCTs were available for qualitative analysis. RCTs were identified for oral/sublingual ketamine for depression, however, none of these trials reported anti-SI effects preventing quantitative analysis for these routes of delivery. No RCTs for intramuscular (IM) ketamine were identified. The findings suggest that single-dose IV ketamine/IN esketamine is associated with robust reductions in suicidal thoughts at 2-h, 4-h, and 24-h post-intervention. In addition, future studies on IM/oral/sublingual ketamine and comparative studies are warranted to evaluate the anti-SI efficacy of distinct formulations and routes of administration."
"8561","1","Prevalence of self-reported movement dysfunction among young adults with a history of ecstasy and methamphetamine use.^\nBACKGROUND: Illicit stimulant use is associated with long-lasting changes in movement and movement-related brain regions. The aim of our study was to investigate the prevalence of movement dysfunction in this population. We hypothesized that prevalence of self-reported movement dysfunction is higher among stimulant users than non-stimulant users. METHODS: Three groups of adults completed a survey containing questions about demographics, health, drug use, and movement. The groups consisted of ecstasy users with no history of methamphetamine use (ecstasy group, n = 190, 20 ± 3 yrs.), methamphetamine users (methamphetamine group, n = 331, 23 ± 5 yrs.), and non-stimulant users (control group, n = 228, 25 ± 8 yrs.). Movement data was analyzed with logistic regression. RESULTS: In the unadjusted logistic regression model, group had a significant effect on fine hand control, tremor, and voice/speech questions, but not on other movement domain questions. The prevalence of tremor and abnormal fine hand control was significantly higher in the ecstasy and methamphetamine groups than in the control group (p < 0.018), and changes in voice/speech was more prevalent in the ecstasy group than in the control group (p = 0.015). Age and use of cannabis and hallucinogens were confounding variables. However, inspection of chi-square tables suggests that the effect of these parameters on the movement data is likely to be minor. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of self-reported tremor and changes in fine hand control and voice/speech is significantly higher in stimulant users than in non-stimulant users. Inclusion of these common and noticeable changes in body function may aid public health campaigns that target prevention or harm minimization."
"9613","1","Chronic 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) Use Is Related to Glutamate and GABA Concentrations in the Striatum But Not the Anterior Cingulate Cortex.^\nBackground: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a widely used recreational substance inducing acute release of serotonin. Previous studies in chronic MDMA users demonstrated selective adaptations in the serotonin system, which were assumed to be associated with cognitive deficits. However, serotonin functions are strongly entangled with glutamate as well as γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) neurotransmission, and studies in MDMA-exposed rats show long-term adaptations in glutamatergic and GABAergic signaling. Methods: We used proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to measure the glutamate-glutamine complex (GLX) and GABA concentrations in the left striatum and medial anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) of 44 chronic but recently abstinent MDMA users and 42 MDMA-naïve healthy controls. While the Mescher-Garwood point-resolved-spectroscopy sequence (MEGA-PRESS) is best suited to quantify GABA, recent studies reported poor agreement between conventional short-echo-time PRESS and MEGA-PRESS for GLX measures. Here, we applied both sequences to assess their agreement and potential confounders underlying the diverging results. Results: Chronic MDMA users showed elevated GLX levels in the striatum but not the ACC. Regarding GABA, we found no group difference in either region, although a negative association with MDMA use frequency was observed in the striatum. Overall, GLX measures from MEGA-PRESS, with its longer echo time, appeared to be less confounded by macromolecule signal than the short-echo-time PRESS and thus provided more robust results. Conclusion: Our findings suggest that MDMA use affects not only serotonin but also striatal GLX and GABA concentrations. These insights may offer new mechanistic explanations for cognitive deficits (e.g., impaired impulse control) observed in MDMA users."

Methods: Bulbectomized (OBX) rats and sham controls were assigned to four subgroups according to the treatment they received (ketamine, saline, ketamine + rapamycin, and saline + rapamycin). The animals were subjected to open field (OF), elevated plus maze (EPM), passive avoidance (PA), Morris water maze (MWM), and Carousel maze (CM) tests. Blood samples were collected before and after drug administration for analysis of phosphorylated mTOR level. After behavioral testing, brains were removed for evaluation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in prefrontal cortex (PFC) and hippocampus. Results: Ketamine normalized hyperactivity of OBX animals in EPM and increased the time spent in open arms. Rapamycin pretreatment resulted in elimination of ketamine effect in EPM test. In CM test, ketamine + rapamycin administration led to cognitive impairment not observed in saline-, ketamine-, or saline + rapamycin-treated OBX rats. Prefrontal BDNF content was significantly decreased, and level of mTOR was significantly elevated in OBX groups. Conclusions: OBX animals significantly differed from sham controls in most of the tests used. Treatment had more profound effect on OBX phenotype than controls. Pretreatment with rapamycin eliminated the anxiolytic and antidepressant effects of ketamine in task-dependent manner. The results indicate that ketamine + rapamycin application resulted in impaired stress responses manifested by cognitive deficits in active place avoidance (CM) test. Intensity of stressor (mild vs. severe) used in the behavioral tests had opposite effect on controls and on OBX animals. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"
"5759","1","Updating of working memory in ecstasy polydrug users: Findings from fNIRS.^\nAims/Objectives: Cognitive deficits are now well documented in ecstasy (MDMA) users with type and relative demand of task emerging as important factors. The updating component of executive processes appears to be particularly affected. The study reported here used functional near infrared spectroscopy imaging to investigate changes in cortical haemodynamics during memory updating. Method: Twenty ecstasy users and 20 non-users completed verbal and spatial memory updating tasks and brain blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change was measured using functional near infrared spectroscopy. Results: There was no interaction between group and difficulty on the updating tasks, though there was a significant main effect of difficulty on both tasks. The effects of group approached significance on the verbal updating task. There were significant differences in blood oxygenation and deoxygenation change at optodes centred over the right and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, with ecstasy users showing greater blood oxygenation than the other groups. Discussion: The lack of a behavioural difference on both tasks but presence of blood oxygenation and deoxygenation changes in letter updating provides support for the notion that ecstasy-polydrug users are investing more effort to achieve the same behavioural output. Total lifetime dose was high, and recency of use was significantly related to most changes, suggesting that heavy and recent use may be particularly detrimental."

These drugs were used quite extensively before they became prohibited. This ban had little impact on recreational use, but effectively stopped research and clinical treatments, which up to that point had looked very promising in several areas of psychiatry. In the past decade a number of groups have been working to re-evaluate the utility of these substances in medicine. So far highly promising preliminary data have been produced with psilocybin in anxiety, depression, smoking, alcoholism, and with MDMA for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcoholism. These findings have led to the European Medicines Agency approving psilocybin for a phase 3 study in treatment-resistant depression and the Food and Drug Administration for PTSD with MDMA. Both trials should read out in 2020, and if the results are positive we are likely to see these medicines approved for clinical practice soon afterwards. ."

This presentation will examine the rationale, methodology, and findings of 2 recent areas of research attention, the use of a psilocybin treatment model for existential anxiety reactive to advanced cancer and the use of an MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐methamphetamine) treatment model for social anxiety in adults with autism spectrum disorder. Methods: Double‐blind, placebo‐controlled methodologies were utilized in both studies. The psilocybin study utilized a within‐subject control design, with each subject administered 2 blinded treatment sessions, one with the experimental drug and the other with the placebo control. The MDMA study randomized subjects into either the experimental drug group or the placebo group, administering 2 treatment sessions to all subjects. Following the 6‐month data‐collection follow‐up period, the blind was broken and 2 open‐label MDMA sessions were offered to each of the subjects who had been randomized to the placebo group. Results: The psilocybin and MDMA studies each established feasibility as well as effective safety parameters. With the psilocybin investigation, statistically significant reductions in anxiety were identified at various points over the 6‐month follow‐up period, along with a notable reduction in depression scores at the 6‐month data point. The MDMA study demonstrated a drug effect size of 1.4 for reduction of social anxiety. Conclusions: Both the psilocybin and MDMA studies demonstrated trends toward therapeutic efficacy, with amelioration of identified target symptoms. Each of these pilot investigations succeeded in obtaining all necessary regulatory approvals, requisite funding, and outcome measures consistent with therapeutic outcome. Both studies support further clinical explorations of the treatment potential of these novel psychoactive compounds. AD, ASD, PPC"
"5927","1","Blinding and expectancy confounds in psychedelic randomized controlled trials.^\nIntroduction: There is increasing interest in the potential for psychedelic drugs such as psilocybin, LSD and ketamine to treat several mental health disorders, with a growing number of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) being conducted to investigate the therapeutic effectiveness of psychedelics.Areas covered: We review previous literature on expectancy effects and blinding in the context of psychedelic RCTs - literature which strongly suggest that psychedelic RCTs might be confounded by de-blinding and expectancy. We conduct systematic reviews of psychedelic RCTs using Medline, PsychInfo and EMBASE (Jan 1990 - Nov 2020) and show that currently reported psychedelic RCTs have generally not reported pre-trial expectancy, nor the success of blinding procedures.Expert opinion: While psychedelic RCTs have generally shown promising results, with large effect sizes reported, we argue that treatment effect sizes in psychedelic RCTs are likely over-estimated due to de-blinding of participants and high levels of response expectancy. We suggest that psychedelic RCTs should routinely measure de-blinding and expectancy. Careful attention should be paid to clinical trial design and the instructions given to participants to allow these confounds to be reduced, estimated and removed from effect size estimates. We urge caution in interpreting effect size estimates from extant psychedelic RCTs."

"6614","1","What’s in a Name? Correlates of Ecstasy Users Knowing or Agreeing that Molly is Ecstasy/MDMA.^\nEcstasy (MDMA) has regained popularity in powder and crystalline form, known as Molly. However, it is unknown whether all Molly users are aware that Molly is ecstasy. A total of 1045 nightclub/festival-attending adults in New York City were surveyed about ecstasy/MDMA/Molly use in 2016. Users were asked if they agreed that “Molly is (or is supposed to be) ecstasy/MDMA.” Of the 43.5% reporting lifetime use, 84.6% agreed that Molly is ecstasy, 9.5% disagreed, and 5.9% reported not knowing that Molly is ecstasy. Prevalence of use of other drugs (e.g., ketamine, opioids, methamphetamine, NBOMe, 2C series) was lowest among those not knowing that Molly is ecstasy, and highest among those not agreeing that Molly is ecstasy. Those not knowing that Molly is ecstasy were less likely to have used powder or crystal MDMA and less likely to have used in the past 12 months or to report intention to use again. Those disagreeing or not knowing that Molly is ecstasy were at over six times the odds of obtaining ecstasy from an unknown dealer, and those disagreeing were at four times higher odds of having suspected or found out that their ecstasy was adulterated. Results suggest that knowing or agreeing that Molly is ecstasy/MDMA can help indicate ecstasy-related risk."

Qualitative focus groups were conducted with eight young adults who attended trance parties but did not consume MDMA in order to explore protective factors that prevented participants from consuming MDMA. The focus groups were audio recorded, transcribed and analysed, using thematic analysis. Five main themes emerged from the analysis. These themes were named as follows: knowledge and beliefs relating to MDMA, fear of losing control, fear of sexual contact, learning from others who have consumed MDMA and self-preservation. Participants overwhelmingly stated that one of the main reasons they did not use MDMA was because it was chemical in nature. However, participants admitted to using cannabis and mushrooms and rationalised this by stating that they were natural. The researchers had difficulty in attaining participants for this study as few people attend trance parties and abstain from using MDMA."

Hair samples (10 mg) were washed with distilled water and acetone, mechanically pulverized for 1.5 min with a bead mill, and then incubated in 1 mL of methanol under ultrasonication at 50 °C for 1 h. The resulting solutions were evaporated to dryness, derivatized using heptafluorobutyric anhydride (HFBA) at 50 °C for 30 min, and analyzed by GC-MS. The linear ranges were 0.1-20.0 ng/mg for AP and MA and 0.05-20.0 ng/mg for MDA, MDMA, and NKT, with the coefficients of determination (r2 > 0.9982). The intra-day and inter-day precisions were within 11.5% and 12.8%, respectively. The intra-day and inter-day accuracies were -4.1% to 5.8% and -6.6% to 4.2%, respectively. The limits of detections (LODs) for each compound were lower than 0.028 ng/mg. The recoveries were in the range of 78.9-101.2%. Based on these results, the method proved to be effective for the rapid and simple determination of phenylalkylamine derivatives in hair specimens. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"8122","1","The antidepressant effect and safety of non-intranasal esketamine: A systematic review.^\nBACKGROUND: The introduction of esketamine into the field of psychiatry comes on the heels of excitement from studies on racemic ketamine. While the intranasal route has been the most studied to date, other modes of administration of esketamine may also be of interest in the management of depression. AIMS: To systematically review the literature on non-intranasal esketamine for depression in terms of its antidepressant effect and safety. METHODS: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar from inception up to February 2021. Search terms included a combination of Medical Subject Headings and text words indicative of esketamine and depression. We selected both controlled and uncontrolled studies examining non-intranasal esketamine for the treatment of depression. RESULTS: We identified four randomized controlled trials (RCTs) on intravenous esketamine and 15 open-label studies on intravenous (n = 80), subcutaneous (n = 73), and oral (n = 5) esketamine. We found intravenous, subcutaneous, and possibly oral administration of esketamine to be effective in reducing depressive symptoms in most patients with major depressive disorder, bipolar depression, and (severe) treatment-resistant depression. Clinical response to repeated administration of esketamine persisted over the course of treatment. Esketamine was well tolerated by most patients, but open-label data indicate marked psychotomimetic symptoms in exceptional cases. The overall quality of the controlled studies was considered high, the overall quality of the uncontrolled studies low to moderate. CONCLUSIONS: Intravenous, subcutaneous, and possibly oral esketamine may offer an effective and safe addition to the depression treatment armamentarium. However, as most included studies lacked a control group and had small sample sizes, the quality of our results is limited. Different types and formulations of ketamine remain to be compared directly."
"5703","1","Ketamine modulates fronto-striatal circuitry in depressed and healthy individuals.^\nKetamine improves motivation-related symptoms in depression but simultaneously elicits similar symptoms in healthy individuals, suggesting that it might have different effects in health and disease. This study examined whether ketamine affects the brain's fronto-striatal system, which is known to drive motivational behavior. The study also assessed whether inflammatory mechanisms-which are known to influence neural and behavioral motivational processes-might underlie some of these changes. These questions were explored in the context of a double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover trial of ketamine in 33 individuals with treatment-resistant major depressive disorder (TRD) and 25 healthy volunteers (HVs). Resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rsfMRI) was acquired 2 days post-ketamine (final sample: TRD n = 27, HV n = 19) and post-placebo (final sample: TRD n = 25, HV n = 18) infusions and was used to probe fronto-striatal circuitry with striatal seed-based functional connectivity. Ketamine increased fronto-striatal functional connectivity in TRD participants toward levels observed in HVs while shifting the connectivity profile in HVs toward a state similar to TRD participants under placebo. Preliminary findings suggest that these effects were largely observed in the absence of inflammatory (C-reactive protein) changes and were associated with both acute and sustained improvements in symptoms in the TRD group. Ketamine thus normalized fronto-striatal connectivity in TRD participants but disrupted it in HVs independently of inflammatory processes. These findings highlight the potential importance of reward circuitry in ketamine's mechanism of action, which may be particularly relevant for understanding ketamine-induced shifts in motivational symptoms."
"4901","1","Cortical dynamics during psychedelic and anesthetized states induced by ketamine.^\nKetamine is a unique drug that has psychedelic and anesthetic properties in a dose-dependent manner. Recent studies have shown that ketamine anesthesia appears to maintain the spatiotemporal complexity of cortical activation evoked by transcranial magnetic stimulation, while a psychedelic dose of ketamine is associated with increased spontaneous magnetoencephalographic signal diversity. However, a systematic investigation of the dose-dependent effects of ketamine on cortical complexity using the same modality is required. Furthermore, it is unknown whether the complexity level stabilizes or fluctuates over time for the duration of ketamine exposure. Here we investigated the spatiotemporal complexity of spontaneous high-density scalp electroencephalography (EEG) signals in healthy volunteers during alterations of consciousness induced by both subanesthetic and anesthetic doses of ketamine. Given the fast transient spectral dynamics, especially during the gamma-burst pattern after loss of consciousness, we employed a method based on Hidden Markov modeling to classify the EEG signals into a discrete set of brain states that correlated with different behavioral states. We characterized the spatiotemporal complexity specific for each brain state as measured through the Lempel-Ziv complexity algorithm. After controlling for signal diversity due to spectral changes, we found that the subanesthetic dose of ketamine is associated with an elevated complexity level relative to baseline, while the brain activity following an anesthetic dose of ketamine is characterized by alternating low and high complexity levels until stabilizing at a high level comparable to that during baseline. Thus, spatiotemporal complexity associated with ketamine-induced state transitions has features of general anesthesia, normal consciousness, and altered states of consciousness. These results improve our understanding of the complex pharmacological, neurophysiological, and phenomenological properties of ketamine."
"3937","0","The Nonclassic Psychedelic Ibogaine Disrupts Cognitive Maps.^\nBackground: The ability of psychedelic compounds to profoundly alter mental function has been long known, but the underlying changes in cellular-level information encoding remain poorly understood. Methods: We used two-photon microscopy to record from the retrosplenial cortex in head-fixed mice running on a treadmill before and after injection of the nonclassic psychedelic ibogaine (40 mg/kg intraperitoneally). Results: We found that the cognitive map, formed by the representation of position encoded by ensembles of individual neurons in the retrosplenial cortex, was destabilized by ibogaine when mice had to infer position between tactile landmarks. This corresponded with increased neural activity rates, loss of correlation structure, and increased responses to cues. Ibogaine had surprisingly little effect on the size-frequency distribution of network activity events, suggesting that signal propagation within the retrosplenial cortex was largely unaffected. Conclusions: Taken together, these data support proposals that compounds with psychedelic properties disrupt representations that are important for constraining neocortical activity, thereby increasing the entropy of neural signaling. Furthermore, the loss of expected position encoding between landmarks recapitulated effects of hippocampal impairment, suggesting that disruption of cognitive maps or other hippocampal processing may be a contributing mechanism of discoordinated neocortical activity in psychedelic states."

Nicholson, Robert L. Balster, J. David Leander, Patric K. Stanton, Amanda L. Gross, Roger A. Kroes and Joseph R. Moskal (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2013[Apr], Vol 38[5], 729-742). In the original article, there were some errors in page 2, right column, fifth and sixth lines in the 'Drugs' section. The corrections are present in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2013-10132-003[/rid]). Recent human clinical studies with the NMDA receptor (NMDAR) antagonist ketamine have revealed profound and long-lasting antidepressant effects with rapid onset in several clinical trials, but antidepressant effects were preceded by dissociative side effects. Here we show that GLYX-13, a novel NMDAR glycine-site functional partial agonist, produces an antidepressant-like effect in the Porsolt, novelty induced hypophagia, and learned helplessness tests in rats without exhibiting substance abuse-related, gating, and sedative side effects of ketamine in the drug discrimination, conditioned place preference, pre-pulse inhibition and open-field tests. Like ketamine, the GLYX-13-induced antidepressant-like effects required AMPA/kainate receptor activation, as evidenced by the ability of NBQX to abolish the antidepressant-like effect. Both GLYX-13 and ketamine persistently (24 h) enhanced the induction of long-term potentiation of synaptic transmission and the magnitude of NMDAR-NR2B conductance at rat Schaffer collateral-CA1 synapses in vitro. Cell surface biotinylation studies showed that both GLYX-13 and ketamine led to increases in both NR2B and GluR1 protein levels, as measured by Western analysis, whereas no changes were seen in mRNA expression (microarray and qRT-PCR). GLYX-13, unlike ketamine, produced its antidepressant-like effect when injected directly into the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC). These results suggest that GLYX-13 produces an antidepressant-like effect without the side effects seen with ketamine at least in part by directly modulating NR2B-containing NMDARs in the MPFC. Furthermore, the enhancement of 'metaplasticity' by both GLYX-13 and ketamine may help explain the long-lasting antidepressant effects of these NMDAR modulators.

Thirty healthy individuals self-administered Salvia divinorum via combustion and inhalation in a quiet, comfortable research setting. Experimental sessions, post-session interviews, and 8-week follow-up meetings were audio recorded and transcribed to provide the primary qualitative material analyzed here. Additionally, post-session responses to the Hallucinogen Rating Scale provided a quantitative groundwork for mixed-methods discussion. Qualitative data underwent thematic content analysis, being coded independently by three researchers before being collaboratively integrated to provide the final results. Three main themes and 10 subthemes of acute intoxication emerged, encompassing the qualities of the experience, perceptual alterations, and cognitive-affective shifts. The experience was described as having rapid onset and being intense and unique. Participants reported marked changes in auditory, visual, and interoceptive sensory input; losing normal awareness of themselves and their surroundings; and an assortment of delusional phenomena. Additionally, the abuse potential of Salvia divinorum was examined post hoc. These findings are discussed in light of previous research, and provide an initial framework for greater understanding of the subjective effects of Salvia divinorum, an emerging drug of abuse."
"7292","1","Cancer Healthcare Workers' Perceptions toward Psychedelic-Assisted Therapy: A Preliminary Investigation.^\nRecent clinical trials suggest that psychedelic-assisted therapy is a promising intervention for reducing anxiety and depression and ameliorating existential despair in advanced cancer patients. However, little is known about perceptions toward this treatment from the key gatekeepers to this population. The current study aimed to understand the perceptions of cancer healthcare professionals about the potential use of psychedelic-assisted therapy in advanced cancer patients. Twelve cancer healthcare professionals including doctors, nurses, psychologists and social workers took part in a semi-structured interview which explored their awareness and perceptions toward psychedelic-assisted therapy with advanced cancer patients. Data were analysed using thematic analysis. Four inter-connected themes were identified. Two themes relate to the role and responsibility of being a cancer healthcare worker: (1) 'beneficence: a need to alleviate the suffering of cancer patients' and (2) 'non-maleficence: keeping vulnerable cancer patients safe', and two themes relate specifically to the potential for psychedelic-assisted therapy as (3) 'a transformative approach with the potential for real benefit' but that (4) 'new frontiers can be risky endeavours'. The findings from this study suggest intrigue and openness in cancer healthcare professionals to the idea of utilising psychedelic-assisted therapy with advanced cancer patients. Openness to the concept appeared to be driven by a lack of current effective treatment options and a desire to alleviate suffering. However, acceptance was tempered by concerns around safety and the importance of conducting rigorous, well-designed trials. The results from this study provide a useful basis for engaging with healthcare professionals about future research, trial design and potential clinical applications."
"9191","0","Culturally informed research design issues in a study for MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for posttraumatic stress disorder.^\nRecent research suggests that psychedelic drugs can be powerful agents of change when utilized in conjunction with psychotherapy. Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy has been studied as a means of helping people overcome posttraumatic stress disorder, believed to work by reducing fear of traumatic memories and increasing feelings of trust and compassion toward others, without inhibiting access to difficult emotions. However,research studies for psychedelic psychotherapies have largely excluded people of color, leaving important questions unaddressed for these populations. At the University of Connecticut, we participated as a study site in a MAPS-sponsored, FDA-reviewed Phase 2 open-label multi site study, with a focus on providing culturally informed care to people of color. We discuss the development of a study site focused on the ethnic minority trauma experience,including assessment of racial trauma, design of informed consent documents to improve understanding and acceptability to people of color, diversification of the treatment team, ongoing training for team members, validation of participant experiences of racial oppression at a cultural and individual level, examination of the setting and music used during sessions for cultural congruence, training for the independent rater pool, community outreach, and institutional resistance. We also discuss next steps in ensuring that access to culturally informed care is prioritized as MDMA and other psychedelics move into late phase trials, including the importance of diverse sites and training focused on therapy providers of color.

"5436","0","Predicting individual responses to drug treatment in schizophrenia: a test dose model.^\nThe literature and the findings from the Camarillo Schizophrenia Research Project reported in this paper indicate that a satisfactory method for predicting the response of an individual schizophrenic patient to antipsychotic drugs has yet to be devised. A test dose procedure is described which offers promise of a practical approach to selecting the most appropriate drug and dosage for a particular patient and tailoring blood concentrations to the needs of the individual case. Preliminary findings indicate that the test dose procedure is feasible; that detectable changes occur after a single test dose; and that measurements made during the test dose period may be predictive of eventual outcome. These findings are, of course, only a report of a preliminary pilot experiment, subject to important caveats about small number of cases, interpretation of large numbers of correlation coefficients, and need for cross validation. Nevertheless they are encouraging and suggest that the test dose approach has considerable potential for further research."
"9237","0","Perspective: Can psychedelic-assisted therapy be a promising aid in compulsive sexual behavior disorder treatment?.^\nRecently, there has been an increase in studies yielding evidence for psychedelics' anxiolytic and anti-depressive qualities. Preliminary evidence for treatment in substance addiction is also available. In our manuscript, we present a perspective on the possible effectiveness and mechanisms of action of psychedelics' introduction in the treatment of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder (CSBD) and other p roblematic sexual behaviors, which are considered representative of the so-called “behavioral addiction” category. Evidence for the efficacy of Mindfulness Based Interventions in CSBD treatment is promising. Psychedelics- and mindfulness-induced states share common characteristics on both a subjective and objective level. One of the proposed mechanisms regards reduction of experiential avoidance through the promotion of exposure and acceptance. On the neurophysiological level, a shift from higher- to lower-level association regions and an impact on 5- HT2A receptors is observed. Elaborated mechanisms explain the possible enhancement of therapeutic processes by psychedelics. Psychedelics' relative safety and low addictive potential support their introduction into traditional forms of therapy for CSBD and other out of control behaviors."
"6262","1","A Randomised, Controlled Trial of MDMA-assisted Prolonged Exposure Therapy for Comorbid Alcohol Use Disorder and Post-traumatic Stress Disorder.^\nWe urgently require new strategies for the treatment of comorbid PTSD and alcohol dependence. Recent evidence has shown strong support for trauma‐focused integrated treatments (namely COPE), however only 49% demonstrate clinically significant improvements. MDMA may be a promising approach to improve response to COPE for this population. Emerging evidence suggests that MDMA‐assisted therapy may be of promise for PTSD, and has demonstrated a good safety profile and potential efficacy in alcohol dependence. This project will evaluate the clinical efficacy and tolerability of MDMA‐assisted COPE relative to a placebo‐assisted COPE. We hypothesise that MDMA treated patients will be have a reduction in PTSD symptom severity as well as heavy drinking. We will utilise a double blind, randomised, controlled design. A sample of 120 individuals will receive 14 weeks of treatment including 12 COPE sessions and 2 dosing sessions with MDMA (80‐160mg) or placebo."
"5398","1","Effects of nicotine on the neurophysiological and behavioral effects of ketamine in humans.^\nBackground: N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor hypofunction has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia and its associated neurocognitive impairments. The high rate of cigarette smoking in schizophrenia raises questions about how nicotine modulates putative NMDA receptor hypofunction in the illness. Accordingly, we examined the modulatory effects of brain nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) stimulation on NMDA receptor hypofunction by examining the interactive effects of nicotine, a nAChR agonist, and ketamine, a non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist, on behavioral and neurophysiological measures in healthy human volunteers. Methods: From an initial sample of 17 subjects (age range 18–55 years), 8 subjects successfully completed 4 test sessions, each separated by at least 3 days, during which they received ketamine or placebo and two injections of nicotine or placebo in a double-blind, counterbalanced manner. Schizophrenia-like effects Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale, perceptual alterations Clinician Administered Dissociative Symptoms Scale, subjective effects Visual Analog Scale and auditory event-related brain potentials (mismatch negativity, MMN; P300) were assessed during each test session. Results: Consistent with existing studies, ketamine induced transient schizophrenia-like behavioral effects. P300 was reduced and delayed by ketamine regardless of whether it was elicited by a target (P3b) or novel (P3a) stimulus, while nicotine only reduced the amplitude of P3a. Nicotine did not rescue P300 from the effects of ketamine; the interactions of ketamine and nicotine were not significant. While nicotine significantly reduced MMN amplitude, ketamine did not. Conclusion: Nicotine failed to modulate ketamine-induced neurophysiological and behavioral effects in this preliminary study. Interestingly, ketamine reduced P3b amplitude and nicotine reduced P3a amplitude, suggesting independent roles of NMDA receptor and nAChR in the generation of P3b and P3a, respectively.

"4633","1","Creative processes under the influence of a low dose of LSD: a placebo-controlled, double-blind trial in healthy volunteers.^\nBackground: Previously scientific studies have shown the potential of psychedelics in full hallucinogenic doses to change creativity, with enhancing effects on divergent thinking specifically while under the influence of the substance. This effect might be beneficial in a therapeutic context, in patients suffering from rigid thinking patterns, like depression. Anecdotal evidence has suggested that psychedelics in small, sub‐hallucinogenic doses (microdosing) might improve creativity, and some users selfmedicate with it to find relief for their depressive symptoms. While scientific research with small doses of psychedelics is scarce, we aimed to quantify the cognitive effects of single small LSD doses on creative processes in healthy volunteers in a dosefinding study. Methods: The study was conducted according to a doubleblind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, within‐subject design with four oral LSD doses (0, 5, 10, and 20 μg, LSD base) given on four separate test days, with minimally five days of washout in between. LSD was formulated as a solution of 25 μg LSD base in 1mL ethanol (96%) which resulted in 0.2, 0.4, and 0.8 mL LSD, for 5, 10, and 20 μg LSD. Doses were administered sublingually with a 1 mL syringe. To mask the treatment condition, ethanol was added so that all syringes contained the same volume. Placebo was 1 mL ethanol only (96%). Participants were 24 healthy males (N = 12) and females (N = 12) aged 22.75 on average (SD = 2.97). All consumed alcohol and had experience with other recreational drugs. Task‐based creativity was assessed three hours post‐treatment with the Alternate Uses Task (AUT) and five hours post‐treatment with the Story Writing task. In the latter participants were asked to write a (non)‐fictive story around two given words. To assess the level of divergent thinking or creativity of the story, two independent raters assigned a creativity score between zero to five to the stories and their scores were averaged to a final creativity score. The AUT is a measure of divergent thinking. Responses are scored afterward by two independent raters. Dependent outcome variables are Fluency, Originality, the ratio of Fluency and Originality, Flexibility, and Elaboration. Parallel versions of tasks were used on separate test days. In addition, the participant selfrated how creative s/he felt on a visual analogue scale (VAS). This was done eleven times during the test day, and daily, up to four days after treatment administration. Blood samples were taken during the test day to determine LSD concentrations. The study was conducted according to the declaration of Helsinki and its amendments, which is the international convention governing drug studies in human volunteers (World‐Medical‐ Association, 2013). A permit for obtaining, storing, and administering LSD was obtained from the Dutch Drug Enforcement Administration. The study was registered in the Netherlands Trial Register (NTR7102). All data entered SPSS version 24.0, where a General Linear Model Repeated Measures (GLM RM) Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was run on data of the AUT, the Story Writing Task, and the VAS. LSD (four levels) was included as a within‐subject factor; additional within‐subject factors were Time (ten levels) or Day (four levels) for the VASs. In the case of a main LSD or Time effect, Bonferronicorrected pairwise comparisons and contrast analyses for that particular measure were conducted with the placebo or the baseline as a reference category. Partial eta squared (partial η2) is reported to demonstrate the effect magnitude, and it is based on Cohen's f, which defines small, medium, and large as respectively 0.10, 0.25, and 0.50, which corresponds to partial η2 values of 0.01, 0.06, and 0.14. Results: GLM RM ANOVA did not show main effects of LSD on AUT parameters Fluency (F3,69 = 0.65, p = 0.59, partial η2 = 0.03), Elaboration (F3,69 = 0.09, p = 0.99, partial η2 = 0.004), Flexibility (F3,69 = 2.30, p = 0.08, partial η2 = 0.09), Originality (F3,69 = 0.28, p = 0.84, partial η2 = 0.01), and Ra io (F3,66 = 0.17, p = 0.92, partial η2 = 0.01). RM GLM ANOVA revealed no main LSD effect (F3,69 = 1.31, p = 0.28, partial η2 = 0.05) on rater‐scored Creativity which was 2.76 (0.22) on average (SEM) on a scale from zero to five. GLM RM ANOVA did not reveal main effects of LSD (F3,57 = 1.22, p = 0.31, partial η2 = 0.06) or Day (F3,57 = 0.14, p = 0.93, partial η2 = 0.008), or their interaction (F9,171 = 1.03, p = 0.42, partial η2 = 0.05) on the self‐rated levels of Creativity experienced up to four days after treatment administration. At 3 hours post‐administration the AUT was performed the predicted mean (SD) LSD plasma concentrations were 113 (32), 212 (70), and 391 (146) pg/mL after LSD 5, 10, and 20 μg, respectively. Predicted LSD concentrations at 5 hours after drug administration, when the Story Writing Task was performed, were 69 (21), 137 (57), and 258 (112) pg/mL after the 5, 10, and 20 μg dose, respectively. Conclusions: Despite anecdotal reports of positive effects of psychedelic microdoses on creative cognitive processes in users, the present study did not demonstrate LSD effects on task‐based or self‐rated creative thinking. Nonetheless, findings stimulate further research in a placebo‐controlled setting, and eventually in patient populations, to test whether LSD microdoses change potentially creative processes earlier after LSD administration, closer to LSD plasma peak concentrations, or after repeated administrations."

Caloric intake and body weight fell significantly after 8 days of treatment although there was no definite change in appetite ratings. Average central turnover of serotonin, as estimated by the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) accumulation of 5 hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5 HIAA) during probenecid loading, decreased by 66%. No significant change in homovanillic acid, the major dopamine product, was apparent. The results support the contention that the effect of fenfluramine on human dietary intake may be mediated by alterations in serotonergic rather than dopaminergic mechanisms."
"502","1","Neuropsychological effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) in recreational users.^\nWhile neuropsychological studies on 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ecstasy) users have been emerging, results have been inconsistent, possibly due to methodological issues. The current study examined the performance of 22 recreational MDMA users compared to 28 age, education, and IQ comparable normal control subjects on a comprehensive battery of neuropsychological tests. Results revealed no significant differences in cognitive functioning between the MDMA users and normal controls. However, greater use of MDMA was associated with poorer scores on several measures of nonverbal memory, and greater frequency users (> or = 50 times) evidenced significantly lower scores on 2 of 3 nonverbal memory tests compared to lesser frequency users (< 50 times). Our results suggest that a subgroup of MDMA patients, specifically heavy MDMA users, evidence declines in nonverbal (visual) memory, however, other cognitive areas appear to be spared."
"1314","1","Ketamine Anesthesia Does Not Improve Depression Scores in Electroconvulsive Therapy: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Although interest in ketamine use during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) has increased, studies have been equivocal with regard to its efficacy. The aims of this clinical trial were to evaluate ketamine's antidepressive effects in ECT as a primary anesthetic, determine ketamine's tolerability when compared with standard anesthesia, and determine if plasma brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is necessary for treatment response. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Adults meeting criteria for treatment-resistant depression undergoing index course ECT received either methohexital (1 to 2 mg/kg) or ketamine (1 to 2 mg/kg) anesthesia in this dual-arm double-blinded randomized clinical trial (NCT02752724). The primary outcome of this study is change in depression questionnaire scores before and after ECT. Seizure data, depression severity using self-reported and clinician-assessed questionnaires, cognitive scoring, and plasma BDNF concentrations were obtained before and after completion of ECT. RESULTS: There were no differences in seizure lengths, hemodynamics, or seizure stimuli between the ketamine (n=23;138 ECTs) and methohexital (n=27;159 ECTs) groups. Depression scores improved similarly after ECT in both groups. In the methohexital group, 15% of patients failed to achieve adequate seizures and were switched to ketamine and 26% were converted to bilateral ECT stimulus, whereas all ketamine patients achieved adequate seizures and only 4% required bilateral stimulus. Plasma BDNF increased after ECT only in the ketamine group. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that ketamine does not significantly improve depression when compared with methohexital as a single induction agent for ECT, increases serum BDNF and does not increase rates of post-ECT agitation. Ketamine use in ECT may have some benefits for some patients that are not captured through standard depression assessment questionnaires alone."
"2208","1","Psilocybin Induces Aberrant Prediction Error Processing of Tactile Mismatch Responses - A Simultaneous EEG-FMRI Study.^\nAs source of sensory information, the body provides a sense of agency and self/non-self-discrimination. The integration of bodily states and sensory inputs with prior beliefs has been linked to the generation of bodily self-consciousness. The ability to detect surprising tactile stimuli is essential for the survival of an organism and for the formation of mental body representations. Despite the relevance for a variety of psychiatric disorders characterized by altered body and self-perception, the neurobiology of these processes is poorly understood. We therefore investigated the effect of psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self-experience, on tactile mismatch responses by combining pharmacological manipulations with simultaneous electroencephalography-functional magnetic resonance imaging (EEG-fMRI) recording. Psi reduced activity in response to tactile surprising stimuli in frontal regions, the visual cortex, and the cerebellum. Furthermore, Psi reduced tactile mismatch negativity EEG responses at frontal electrodes, associated with alterations of body- and self-experience. This study provides first evidence that Psi alters the integration of tactile sensory inputs through aberrant prediction error processing and highlights the importance of the 5-HT2A system in tactile deviancy processing as well as in the integration of bodily and self-related stimuli. These findings may have important implications for the treatment of psychiatric disorders characterized by aberrant bodily self-awareness."

When comparing the psychological traits of ayahuasca participants to a control group, quantitative results using the Zuckerman-Kuhlman-Aluja Personality Questionnaire showed statistically significant higher scores in Impulsive Sensation Seeking, Boredom Susceptibility, and Social Warmth scales. Qualitative analysis of ayahuasca experiences resulted in five main categories: emotional experiences (including social emotions such as love and empathy), corporal experiences, spiritual/transcendental experiences, personal experiences, and visions. Last, qualitative descriptions provide support for the importance of social interactions in the phenomenological manifestations of the psychedelic experience. Both quantitative and qualitative results suggest that the combination of social interactions and the pharmacological action of ayahuasca could facilitate the manifestation of social emotions during the ritual, and may contribute to the long-term increase of empathic and social aspects of personality."
"6432","1","Ecstasy use and its association with sexual behaviors among drug users in New York City.^\nIn the past two decades, recreational use of ecstasy has become a growing concern in the United States, although most studies assessing ecstasy use have focused on white, middle-class adolescents who use ecstasy during raves and in clubs. We assessed the prevalence of recent ecstasy use among predominantly minority heroin, cocaine, and crack users in New York City and the association between ecstasy and sexual risk above and beyond that of the other drugs. Between 2002 and 2004, injection and non-injection heroin, crack and cocaine users (N = 534) completed a risk behavior questionnaire that included items on ecstasy use. Logistic regression was used to investigate the relation between current ecstasy use and sexual behaviors. Of 534 illicit drug users, 69.7% were aged 25 years or older, 65.2% were Hispanic, 27.9% Black and 77.4% male; 36.7% were injectors. 17.2% of respondents reported recent (last six months) ecstasy use. In a multivariable logistic regression model, current ecstasy use was associated both with initiating sex before age 14 (adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 1.51) and having two or more partners in the past two months (AOR = 1.86) after adjusting for age at study entry, current cocaine and marijuana use and being an injection drug user. This study suggests that ecstasy use may be more prevalent among urban drug users. Ecstasy use in urban settings, beyond clubs and raves, should continue to be monitored. © 2005 Springer Science+Business Media, Inc."
"6364","1","Personal and family history of alcohol dependence alters antidepresant response to oral riluzole post-ketamine infusion.^\nBackground: Family history of alcohol dependence is a positive predictor of ketamine's antidepressant effects in unipolar and bipolar depression. As we recently suggested that the glutamatergic modulator riluzole may delay time to relapse after ketamine infusion in a 4 week trial, we investigated if a lifetime personal or family history of alcohol dependence mediated riluzole's effect. Methods: Secondary analysis of randomized, double‐blind placebo controlled trial of treatment‐resistant unipolar depression (18‐65, MADRS≥22) who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) and randomized to double‐blind treatment with riluzole (100‐200 mg/day) or placebo for 4 weeks. Results: Family history of alcohol dependence predicted a positive response to ketamine (p=.02). In subjects randomized to placebo, the family history positive group maintained a greater antidepressant response (p=.002). There was no significant difference in antidepressant efficacy based on a family history of alcoholism in subjects randomized to riluzole (p=.88). No antidepressant difference was observed between placebo and riluzole in subjects with no family history of alcoholism (p=.27). Riluzole inhibited the sustained antidepressant effect in subjects with a family history of alcoholism (p=.04). Past personal history had no main effect (p=.057). Conclusions: Riluzole reduced the antidepressant effect of ketamine in patients with a family history but does not significantly improve the effect in patients without a family history. Personal history did not emerge as a significant factor. Although this study was not specifically powered based on family history, it is unlikely that riluzole extension post‐ketamine is a useful adjunct based on personal or family history of alcoholism."
"3728","1","Effects of low-dose intranasal (S)-ketamine in patients with neuropathic pain.^\nBackground: NMDA receptors are involved in the development and maintenance of neuropathic pain. We evaluated the efficacy and safety of intranasal (S)-ketamine, one of the most potent clinically available NMDA receptor antagonists. Methods: Sixteen patients with neuropathic pain of various origins were randomized into two treatment groups: (S)-ketamine 0.2 mg/kg (group 1); (S)-ketamine 0.4 mg/kg (group 2). Plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine were measured over 6 h by High Performance Liquid Chromatography combined with mass spectrometry. Quantitative sensory testing (QST) was conducted before, during and after treatment. Side effects and amount of pain reduction were recorded. Results: Intranasal (S)-ketamine administration lead to peak plasma concentrations of 27.7 ± 5.9 ng/ml at 10 ± 6.3 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 22.2 ng/ml at 13.8 ± 4.8 min after application (group 2). Maximal plasma concentrations of (S)-norketamine were 18.3 ± 14.9 ng/ml at 81 ± 59 min (group 1) and 34.3 ± 5.5 ng/ml at 75 ± 40 min (group 2). Pain scores decreased significantly in both groups with minimal pain at 60 min after drug administration (70 ± 10% and 61 ± 13% of initial pain in groups 1 and 2). The time course of pain decrease was significantly correlated with plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and (S)-norketamine (partial correlations: (S)-norketamine: -0.90 and -0.86; (S)-ketamine: -0.72 and -0.71 for group 1 and group 2, respectively). Higher dosing elicited significantly more side effects. Intranasal (S)-ketamine had no significant impact on thermal or mechanical detection and pain thresholds in normal or symptomatic skin areas. Conclusions: Intranasal administration of low dose (S)-ketamine rapidly induces adequate plasma concentrations of (S)-ketamine and subsequently of its metabolite (S)-norketamine. The time course of analgesia correlated with plasma concentrations. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)"

(2) Methods: Cross-sectional descriptive study examining sleep quality (Pittsburg Sleep Quality Index), eating behaviour (Three Factor Eating Questionnaire (R18)), tobacco and drug use (ESTUDES questionnaire) and alcohol use (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener). (3) Results: 178 people, of whom 87.1% (155) were women, with an average age of 41.59 ± 10.9 years. A total of 59.6% of the healthcare workers had sleep problems, to a greater or lesser degree. The average daily consumption was 10.56 ± 6.74 cigarettes. The most commonly used drugs included cannabis, occasionally used by 88.37%, cocaine (4.75%), ecstasy (4.65%) and amphetamines (2.33%). A total of 22.73% of participants had increased their drug use, and 22.73% had increased their consumption during the pandemic, with beer and wine accounting for 87.2% of drinks consumed during this period. (4) Conclusions: In addition to the psychological and emotional impact already demonstrated, the COVID-19 crisis has repercussions on sleep quality, eating behaviour and alcohol, tobacco and drug consumption. Psychological disturbances have repercussions on physical and functional aspects of healthcare workers. It is feasible that these alterations are due to stress, and it is necessary to act through treatment and prevention as well as promote healthy habits."
"3719","1","Turn on, Tune in, and Drop out: Predictors of Attrition in a Prospective Observational Cohort Study on Psychedelic Use.^\nBACKGROUND: The resurgence of research and public interest in the positive psychological effects of psychedelics, together with advancements in digital data collection techniques, have brought forth a new type of research design, which involves prospectively gathering large-scale naturalistic data from psychedelic users; that is, before and after the use of a psychedelic compound. A methodological limitation of such studies is their high attrition rate, particularly owing to participants who stop responding after initial study enrollment. Importantly, study dropout can introduce systematic biases that may affect the interpretability of results. OBJECTIVE: Based on a previously collected sample (baseline n=654), here we investigated potential determinants of study attrition in web-based prospective studies on psychedelic use. METHODS: Logistic regression models were used to examine demographic, psychological trait and state, and psychedelic-specific predictors of dropout. Predictors were assessed 1 week before, 1 day after, and 2 weeks after psychedelic use, with attrition being defined as noncompletion of the key endpoint 4 weeks post experience. RESULTS: Predictors of attrition were found among demographic variables including age (β=0.024; P=.007) and educational levels, as well as personality traits, specifically conscientiousness (β=-0.079; P=.02) and extraversion (β=0.082; P=.01). Contrary to prior hypotheses, neither baseline attitudes toward psychedelics nor the intensity of acute challenging experiences were predictive of dropout. CONCLUSIONS: The baseline predictors of attrition identified here are consistent with those reported in longitudinal studies in other scientific disciplines, suggesting their transdisciplinary relevance. Moreover, the lack of an association between attrition and psychedelic advocacy or negative drug experiences in our sample contextualizes concerns about problematic biases in these and related data."
"5403","0","Glutamate modulators as novel interventions for mood disorders.^\nRecent evidence suggests that critical molecules in neurotrophic signaling cascades are long-term targets for currently available monoaminergic antidepressants. As chronic and severe mood disorders are characterized by impairments in neuronal resilience, pharmacological strategies that subserve a neuroprotective function might alter disorder pathophysiology and modify disease progression. Several promising approaches involve modulation of the glutamate neurotransmitter system, via post-synaptic receptor blockade or potentiation and presynaptic vesicular release inhibition. A focused review of the extant scientific literature was conducted, with a discussion of 3 compounds or classes of drugs currently undergoing clinical investigation: ketamine, riluzole, and AMPA receptor potentiators. Recent investigations in mood disordered patients suggest that the NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine might demonstrate rapid antidepressant properties. Riluzole has been shown to reverse glutamate-mediated impairments in neuronal plasticity and to stimulate the synthesis of brain derived neurotrophic factor. Open-label trials in treatment-resistant depression have yielded promising results. Likewise, AMPA receptor potentiators favorably impact neurotrophic factors as well as enhance cognition. CONCLUSIONS: Pharmacological approaches that modulate components of the glutamate system offer novel targets for severe, recurrent mood disorders. Controlled studies are necessary."
"2827","1","The P3 in 'ecstasy' polydrug users during response inhibition and execution.^\nSubstance abuse and associated externalizing disorders are characterized by behavioural disinhibition and low impulse control, with reduced neural inhibition postulated to be the common underlying brain mechanism. The P3 component of event-related potentials (ERPs) is a widely used neurophysiological measure thought to reflect inhibitory brain processes, but as yet has not been assessed in ecstasy users. We recorded ERPs evoked by a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) in 16 current ecstasy polydrug users and 17 controls. The CPT included conditions where a prepared motor response had to be executed (Go) or inhibited (NoGo). Both controls and ecstasy users showed normal, robust patterns of P3 anteriorization and delay in the NoGo compared to the Go condition. Ecstasy users had Lower P3 amplitudes at midline electrodes and a less anterior location of NoGo P3 peaks. These effects became weaker after statistically controlling for age, educational level and lifetime cannabis use. While lower P3 amplitudes are consistent with higher levels of neural disinhibition in ecstasy polydrug users, the normal switch pattern between response execution and inhibition, and the less anterior location of the NoGo P3, do not indicate disturbed inhibitory brain mechanisms. © 2005 British Association for Psychopharmacology."

In-depth interviews with 12 experts in the fields of psychiatry, clinical psychology, medicine, and the effects of psychedelics were conducted in an expert consultation format. Interviews were transcribed, and themes were produced using an interpretative phenomenological analysis (IPA) approach. We found that while the exclusion criteria may be justified for psychedelic protocols that provide minimal psychological support for participants, experts agreed that psychedelic-, ketamine-, and MDMA-assisted psychotherapy are not necessarily contraindicated for all individuals within this group. Rather, results suggest that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy as well as therapy with MDMA and ketamine, which include high levels of support, may be of benefit to some individuals experiencing said conditions and symptoms. Potentially relevant factors for predicting treatment outcomes include specific symptom endorsement, illness duration, symptom severity, quality of therapeutic alliance, role of trauma in symptom etiology and perpetuation, and the level of other supports in the client’s life. An analysis of expert opinions revealed that psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy can potentially benefit people with psychopathological psychosis and psychotic conditions under the right conditions. However, more research needs to be carried out to determine the risks and develop a protocol specific to this population. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2023 APA, all rights reserved)"
"946","1","Brain serotonin synthesis in MDMA (ecstasy) polydrug users: An alpha-[11C]methyl-L-tryptophan study.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) use may have long-term neurotoxic effects. In this study, positron emission tomography with the tracer alpha-[11C]methyl-Ltryptophan (11C-AMT) was used to compare human brain serotonin (5-HT) synthesis capacity in 17 currently drug-free MDMA polydrug users with that in 18 healthy matched controls. Gender differences and associations between regional 11C-AMT trapping and characteristics of MDMA use were also examined. MDMA polydrug users exhibited lower normalized 11C-AMT trapping in pre-frontal, orbitofrontal, and parietal regions, relative to controls. These differences were more widespread in males than in females. Increased normalized 11C-AMT trapping in MDMA users was also observed, mainly in the brainstem and in frontal and temporal areas. Normalized 11C-AMT trapping in the brainstem and prefrontal regions correlated positively and negatively, respectively, with greater lifetime accumulated MDMA use, longer durations of MDMA use, and shorter time elapsed since the last MDMA use. Although the possibility of pre-existing 5-HT alterations pre-disposing people to use MDMA cannot be ruled out, regionally decreased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the forebrain could be interpreted as neurotoxicity of MDMA on distal (frontal) brain regions. On the other hand, increased 5-HT synthesis capacity in the raphe and adjacent areas could be due to compensatory mechanisms."
"8851","1","Psychedelics and workplace harm.^\nThis study aims to understand the relationship between Lifetime Classic Psychedelic Use (LCPU), employment status, and weekly work hours on levels of psychological distress. The data used for this analysis is pooled from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health (NSDUH) from 2008–2019 and includes a sample size of 484,732 individuals. The findings suggest that LCPU and being employed are independently associated with better health. Additionally, the results indicate that psychedelic use is associated with lower distress for those who are employed, volunteer, retired, or permanently disabled. However, those who are unemployed, full-time students, or homemakers may experience higher levels of distress with psychedelic use. Interestingly, the analysis also suggests that those who use psychedelics are working longer hours per week before experiencing an increase in stress. Overall, the study suggests that psychedelics are not likely to have a negative impact on employment outcomes."
"9611","1","Urgent ketamine infusion rapidly eliminated suicidal ideation for a patient with major depressive disorder: A case report.^\nPresents a case report of a 37-year-old married woman with young children, who worked as a professional. She had 2 prior depressive episodes and had previously been treated with paroxetine with a good response. She also had a remote pituitary adenoma resection, and was treated for B12 deficiency and hypothyroidism. There was no significant psychiatric comorbidity including substance use disorders, anxiety disorders, or personality disorders. There were no symptoms of psychosis or mania/ hypomania. Her current depressive episode began 25 months prior when she was overwhelmed by many stressors at home and at work. At month 3, she started treatment with venlafaxine XR up to 300 mg/d by her family physician. She deteriorated at month 6 when her supervisor confronted her with her declining work performance and she left on disability. Twelve months after her episode began, she enrolled in a clinical trial (unpublished) in our tertiary care psychopharmacology unit. Our case outlines how urgent ketamine was feasible to use in a tertiary care psychiatric outpatient practice to rapidly reduce suicidal ideation a patient with major depressive disorder (MDD). The reinstitution of lithium may have contributed to the long-lasting reduction of suicidal ideation. However, if ketamine was unavailable, we would have sent the patient to the emergency department, where she may have been admitted to the inpatient ward and possibly treated with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT). An inpatient psychiatric admission is expensive, stigmatizing, and disruptive to a patient s family life. Additionally, there is often a delay of several days before ECT can be initiated, leaving patients in distress and at risk of self-harm. In summary, we found it feasible to use ketamine urgently in our clinical practice to reduce suicidal ideation and dysphoria for a patient with MDD. Urgent ketamine could potentially reduce use of psychiatric emergency services and the need for inpatient psychiatric admissions. Patients should be carefully selected and close follow-up must be ensured. Future studies should evaluate whether using ketamine urgently improves patient outcomes, patient satisfaction, and to what extent it affects treatment costs compared to the current standard of care for suicidal crises in MDD, including ECT.

"9544","1","Gender differences in abusers of amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine in southwestern China.^\nThe objective of this study was to investigate abuse conditions of new-type drugs for users who are seeking treatment, gender differences, and differences between the amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) users and mixed amphetamine-type stimulants and ketamine (ATS. +. K) poly-drug users. A retrospective analysis was conducted of patients with a final diagnosis of the substance use disorder according to the Diagnoses and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fourth Edition (DSM-IV) who underwent treatment for exposure to new-type drugs at the mental health center of the West China Hospital from March 2009 to May 2011. A questionnaire was used to collect information about socio-demographics, drug abuse conditions and psychiatric co-morbidities. Male subjects were older (p=0.026), had low level education (p=0.003), were less previously married (p<0.001), were more likely to be employed and to hold higher status jobs (p=0.007); 77.1% of subjects had a psychotic disorder, 28.0% of subjects had a mood disorder, 39.7% had an anxiety disorder, and 45.0% had a cognitive impairment disorder. More men used methamphetamine MA (p<0.001), tobacco (p=0.014) and more than one drug substance (p=0.004) compared to women; women were more vulnerable to mood disorders (p=0.034) than men. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use 3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine MDMA (p<0.001) and develop more psychotic disorders (p=0.04) than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (p=0.002), alcohol (p=0.014) and develop more cognitive impairment disorder (p=0.034). The present study found that the new-type drug patients have a high degree of psychiatric morbidities; more men were using MA, tobacco and multi-substance and more women patients experience mood disorder in the gender differences. For the males, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA (3, 4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine) and develop more psychotic disorders than the ATS patients; for females, the ATS. +. K patients were more likely to use MDMA, alcohol and develop more cognitive impairment disorder. These results suggested that the psychiatrists should focus on the mood disorder among females, psychotic disorders among males who abuse ATS and ketamine, and cognitive impairment disorder for the females who abuse ATS and ketamine. © 2012."
"5944","1","Neural correlates of S-ketamine induced psychosis during overt continuous verbal fluency.^\nThe glutamatergic N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor has been implicated in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. Administered to healthy volunteers, a subanesthetic dose of the non-competitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine leads to psychopathological symptoms similar to those observed in schizophrenia. In patients with schizophrenia, ketamine exacerbates the core symptoms of illness, supporting the hypothesis of a glutamatergic dysfunction. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind study design, healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while differences in BOLD responses measured with fMRI were detected. During the scanning period, subjects performed continuous overt verbal fluency tasks (phonological, lexical and semantic). Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine elicited psychosis like psychopathology. Post-hoc t-tests revealed significant differences between placebo and ketamine for the amounts of words generated during lexical and semantic verbal fluency, while the phonological domain remained unaffected. Ketamine led to enhanced cortical activations in supramarginal and frontal brain regions for phonological and lexical verbal fluency, but not for semantic verbal fluency. Ketamine induces activation changes in healthy subjects similar to those observed in patients with schizophrenia, particularly in frontal and temporal brain regions. Our results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDA receptor dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia."
"5031","0","An optimization for postpartum depression risk assessment and preventive intervention strategy based machine learning approaches.^\nBACKGROUND: Postpartum depression (PPD) is one of the most common psychiatric disorders for women after delivery. The establishment of an effective PPD prediction model helps to distinguish high-risk groups, and verifying whether such high-risk groups can benefit from drug intervention is very important for clinical guidance. METHODS: We collected data of parturients that underwent a cesarean delivery. The Control group was divided into a training cohort and a testing cohort. Six different ML models were constructed and we compared their prediction performance in the testing cohort. For model interpretation, we introduced SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). Then, training cohort, ketamine group and dexmedetomidine (DEX) group were classified as high or low risk for PPD by the model. A 1:1 propensity score matching (PSM) was performed to compare the incidence of PPD between two groups in different risk cohorts. RESULTS: Extreme gradient enhancement (XGB) had the best recognition effect, with an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) of 0.789 (95 % CI 0.742-0.836) in the training cohort and 0.744 (95 % CI 0.655-0.823) in the testing cohort, respectively. A threshold of 21.5 % PPD risk probability was determined. After PSM, the results showed that the incidence of PPD in the two intervention groups was significantly different from the control group in the high-risk cohort (P < 0.001) but not in the low-risk cohort (P > 0.001). CONCLUSION: Our study demonstrated that the XGB algorithm provided a more accurate in prediction of PPD risk, and it was beneficial to receive early intervention for the high-risk groups distinguished by the model."
"9158","1","Substance usage intention does not affect attentional bias: implications from Ecstasy/MDMA users and alcohol drinkers.^\nBackground: An attentional bias towards substance-related stimuli has been demonstrated with alcohol drinkers and many other types of substance user. There is evidence to suggest that the strength of an attentional bias may vary as a result of context (or use intention), especially within Ecstasy/MDMA users. Objective: Our aim was to empirically investigate attentional biases by observing the affect that use intention plays in recreational MDMA users and compare the findings with that of alcohol users. Method: Regular alcohol drinkers were compared with MDMA users. Performance was assessed for each group separately using two versions of an eye-tracking attentional bias task with pairs of matched neutral, and alcohol or MDMA-related visual stimuli. Dwell time was recorded for alcohol or MDMA. Participants were tested twice, when intending and not intending to use MDMA or alcohol. Note, participants in the alcohol group did not complete any tasks which involved MDMA-related stimuli and vice versa. Results: Significant attentional biases were found with both MDMA and alcohol users for respective substance-related stimuli, but not control stimuli. Critically, use intention did not affect attentional biases. Attentional biases were demonstrated with both MDMA users and alcohol drinkers when usage was and was not intended. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the robust nature of attentional biases i.e. once an attentional bias has developed, it is not readily affected by intention."
"4204","0","The Effect of MDMA-Induced Anxiety on Neuronal Apoptosis in Adult Male Rats' Hippocampus.^\nEcstasy or MDMA as a psychoactive drug and hallucinogen is considered one of the most commonly used drugs in the world. This psychotropic substance is discussed both as sexually stimulating and reducing fear and anxiety. Amphetamines also destroy neurons in some brain areas. The aim of this study was to investigate the effects of MDMA on anxiety and apoptosis of hippocampal neurons. Forty-two male Wistar rats of mean weight 200-220 g were used and distributed into six groups [control, control-saline, and experimental groups (1.25, 2.5, 5, 10 mg/kg)]. Rats in experimental groups received MDMA at different doses for seven days by intraperitoneal injection and the control-saline group received saline (1 ml/kg); anxiety was then investigated by plus-maze test. Forty-eight hours after behavioural testing brains were taken from animals and fixed, and after tissue processing, slices were stained with TUNEL kit for apoptotic cells. The area densities of apoptotic neurons were measured throughout the hippocampus and compared in all groups (P < 0.05). Physiological studies showed that 1.25 mg/kg and 2.5 mg/kg doses caused anti-anxiety behaviour and 5 and 10 mg/kg doses of MDMA caused anxiety-like behaviour. Moreover, our histological study showed that ecstasy increased apoptotic cell numbers and the highest increase was observed with the 10 mg/kg dose of MDMA. We concluded that MDMA can cause different responses of anxiety-like behaviour in different doses. This phenomenon causes a different ratio of apoptosis in hippocampal formation. Reduction of anxiety-like behaviour induced by the 2.5 mg/kg dose of MDMA can control apoptosis."

Patients and Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out in 23 high schools in Hatay in 2006 using a questionnaire consisted of General Perceived Self-Efficacy Scale, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support, and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory. Results: A total of 1629 students were given study questionnaire. Lifetime substance use prevalence was 38.8 for cigarette smoking, 30.5 for alcohol use, 30.1 for being drunk, 13.9 for regular smoking, 7.1 for volatile substance use, 1.1 for marijuana use, 0.8 for drug use such as heroin, ecstasy, and cocaine. Anxiety scores were higher in smokers while self esteem and self efficacy scores were higher in alcohol users. Exposure to physical violence and use of physical violence within the last year were higher in smokers and in all substance users. Conclusion: Cigarette, alcohol and volatile substances were frequently used among adolescents. The results show that high anxiety is related with smoking, high self esteem and self efficacy are related with alcohol use. Substance use is associated with exposure to and use of violence. © Medical Journal of Trakya University. Published by Ekin Medical Publishing. All rights reserved."
"5735","1","The effects of repeated low doses of LSD in healthy human volunteers.^\nBACKGROUND: There have been frequent reports of the use of psychedelics like lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) at very low doses, known as 'microdosing'. Anecdotal reports suggest that microdosing improves cognitive functioning and mood. However, few controlled studies have examined the effects of exposure to repeated microdoses in humans. The objective of this study was to examine the effects of repeated low doses of LSD on mood, cognition, and subjective experiences in healthy adults. METHODS: In a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study, healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 received four sublingual doses of placebo (n = 18), 13 μg (n = 19), or 26 μg (n = 19) of LSD administered every 3 to 4 days. Physiological, subjective, mood, and cognitive outcome measures were collected over five in‐laboratory sessions. Acute effects were examined during the first and fourth drug administration sessions, and lasting effects of LSD were examined during the fifth drug‐free session. RESULTS: Over the four drug administration sessions, repeated microdoses of LSD elicited dose‐dependent subjective “drug feel” effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05) and stimulant‐like effects (26 μg vs. placebo; 26 μg vs. 13 μg, P < 0.05). LSD also acutely decreased negative mood during a simulated social rejection task (26 μg vs placebo, P < 0.05). Overall, the drug produced minimal effects on physiological, cognitive, and most other mood‐related measures. CONCLUSION: Repeated exposure to low doses of LSD have minimal effects on overall mood and cognitive performance in healthy adults. Future studies with symptomatic volunteers or different doses may be needed to investigate the claims of microdose users."
"8010","1","Is depersonalization disorder initiated by illicit drug use any different? A survey of 394 adults.^\nObjective: Previous studies have documented that in a substantial minority of individuals with depersonalization disorder, onset is first triggered by illicit drug ingestion. The goal of this study was to systematically compare a large sample of individuals with drug-initiated (D) versus non-drug-initiated (ND) chronic depersonalization. Method: We conducted an internet survey of 394 adults endorsing DSM-IV-TR depersonalization and/or derealization symptoms. Sixty-four questions were utilized to inquire about demographic and clinical characteristics, illness course, substance use history, and treatment response. The Cambridge Depersonalization Scale (CDS) was administered. The study was conducted from September 2005 to January 2006. Results: Compared to the ND group (n = 198), the D group (n = 196) included more male and younger individuals. The 2 most common precipitating drugs were cannabis and hallucinogens, followed by ecstasy. The majority of participants had modest use histories prior to onset and never ingested subsequently. The 2 groups endorsed similar illness course, impairment, suicidality, and limited treatment response. The D group showed significantly greater improvement over time than the ND group (P = .002), although the groups did not differ in reported psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy effectiveness. The groups did not differ in CDS total score or on the 4 subscale scores of unreality of self, perceptual alterations, unreality of surroundings, and temporal disintegration. On the numbing subscale of the CDS, the ND group scored higher (P = .009) only prior to controlling for age and gender. Conclusion: The study strongly supports a uniform syndrome for chronic depersonalization/derealization regardless of precipitant. © Copyright 2009 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc."
"2445","0","Attitude and beliefs about the social environment associated with chemsex among MSM visiting STI clinics in the Netherlands: An observational study.^\nBACKGROUND: Drug use during sex, 'chemsex', is common among men who have sex with men (MSM) and related to sexual and mental health harms. This study assessed associations between chemsex and a wide range of determinants among MSM visiting STI clinics to increase understanding of characteristics and beliefs of MSM practicing chemsex. METHODS: In 2018, 785 MSM were recruited at nine Dutch STI clinics; 368 (47%) fully completed the online questionnaire. All participants reported to have had sex in the past six months. Chemsex was defined as using cocaine, crystal meth, designer drugs, GHB/GBL, ketamine, speed or XTC/MDMA during sex in the past six months. Associations between chemsex and psychosocial determinants, socio-demographics, sexual behaviour and using tobacco or alcohol were assessed by multivariable logistic regression analyses. RESULTS: Chemsex was reported by 44% of MSM (161/368) and was not associated with socio-demographics. Independent determinants were 'believing that the majority of friends/sex partners use drugs during sex' (descriptive norm) (aOR: 1.95, 95%CI: 1.43-2.65), 'believing that sex is more fun when using drugs' (attitude) (aOR: 2.06, 95%CI: 1.50-2.84), using tobacco (aOR: 2.65, 95%CI: 1.32-5.32), multiple sex partners (aOR: 2.69, 95%CI: 1.21-6.00), group sex (aOR: 4.65, 95%CI: 1.54-14.05) and using online dating platforms (aOR: 2.73, 95%CI: 1.13-6.62). CONCLUSION: MSM are likely to find themselves in distinct social networks where it is the norm to use drugs when having sex and pleasure is linked to chemsex. Health services should acknowledge the social influence and pleasurable experiences to increase acceptability of strategies aimed at minimizing the possible harms of chemsex."
"123","0","Depression and suicide (Hungarian).^\nEvery form of depression involves a risk of suicide. It is particularly great in the phase of activation, but it is present in every phase of the disease. Short term but intensive psychotherapy was shown to be very beneficial in bringing the patients out of the phase of crisis. In cases of this nature the main consideration is that of gaining time. As a supplementary measure an appropriately selected course of suitable drugs is always indicated. The patient should be helped out of his constrictive mental state which is the principal symptom of depression and the presuicidal syndrome. Initial response should not deceive the therapist, since the risk of suicide still persists in a latent form. Causes which can influence the background of every depression, such as unfavourable external circumstances and severe physical illness should naturally also receive attention, in order to secure a lasting psychotherapeutic result. The numerous failures should not deter the efforts made in this respect."
"512","1","Abnormal visual experiences in individuals with histories of hallucinogen use: A web-based questionnaire.^\nDespite longstanding reports of prolonged or reoccurring perceptual changes in a subset of hallucinogen users, very little is known about Hallucinogen Persisting Perception Disorder and related visual abnormalities in hallucinogen users. We used an online questionnaire to document the symptoms and relationship to drug use of unusual visual phenomena in hallucinogen users. 16,192 individuals viewed the information sheet and 2679 were included in the study. Of these, 224 reported having unrelated diagnoses associated with unusual visual experiences and were excluded from main analyses. Most (60.6%) of the remaining 2455 participants reported having experienced drug-free visual experiences that resembled hallucinogen effects. Probability of experiencing constant or near-constant symptoms was predicted by greater past exposure to specific hallucinogens, including lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD). Although symptoms were common, few (104, or 4.2% of the sample) found them distressing or impairing enough to consider seeking treatment. Visual changes in hallucinogen users may be more common than previously suspected and are worthy of further study. © 2010 Elsevier Ireland Ltd."
"3425","1","Acute psychological and physiological effects of psilocybin in healthy humans: a double-blind, placebo-controlled dose-effect study.^\nRATIONALE: Serotonin (5-Hydroxytryptamine, 5-HT) receptors play an important role in perception, affect regulation and attention. Pharmacological challenge with the 5-HT(2A) agonist psilocybin (PY) is useful in studying the neurobiological basis of cognition and consciousness. OBJECTIVE: Investigation of dose-dependent effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical and physiological parameters. METHODS: Eight subjects received placebo (PL), and 45 (""very low dose, VLD""), 115 (""low dose, LD""), 215 (""medium dose, MD""), and 315 (""high dose, HD"") microg/kg body weight PY. The ""Altered States of Consciousness Rating Scale"" (5D-ASC), the ""Frankfurt Attention Inventory"" (FAIR), and the ""Adjective Mood Rating Scale"" (AMRS) were used to assess the effects of PY on psycho(patho)logical core dimensions, attention, and mood. A 24-h electrocardiogram (EKG) was recorded and blood pressure was measured. Plasma concentrations of thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), prolactin (PRL), cortisol (CORT), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), and standard clinical chemical parameters were determined. RESULTS: PY dose dependently increased scores of all 5D-ASC core dimensions. Only one subject reacted with transient anxiety to HD PY. Compared with PL, MD and HD PY led to a 50% reduction of performance in the FAIR test. ""General inactivation"", ""emotional excitability"", and ""dreaminess"" were the only domains of the AMRS showing increased scores following MD and HD PY. The mean arterial blood pressure (MAP) was moderately elevated only 60 min following administration of HD PY. Neither EKG nor body temperature was affected by any dose of PY. TSH, ACTH, and CORT plasma levels were elevated during peak effects of HD PY, whereas PRL plasma levels were increased following MD and HD PY. CONCLUSION: PY affects core dimensions of altered states of consciousness and physiological parameters in a dose-dependent manner. Our study provided no cause for concern that PY is hazardous with respect to somatic health."
"6321","1","Psychotomimetic effects of single-dose ketamine in children: exploring effects of age and alpha-2 agonist pretreatment.^\nBackground: Sub‐anesthetic doses of NMDA receptor antagonist drugs have been used for conscious sedation and treatment of pain and depression in humans, including clinical use in children for burn management and fracture reductions where ketamine offers less respiratory depression than a commonly used combination of midazolam‐fentanyl. However, NMDA antagonists like ketamine produce dosedependent, transient psychotomimetic effects in adult humans with limited safety data in children. Animal models used to measure NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity observed with sustained NMDA receptor blockade ‐along with limited clinical observations‐ suggest 1) that NMDA antagonist‐induced neurotoxicity and psychotomimetic effects may both be age dependent (i.e., expressed postpuberty) and 2) that certain treatments ‐like alpha‐2 adrenergic agonists‐ may attenuate NMDA antagonistinduced neurotoxicity, with initial experimental results in adult humans suggesting alpha‐2 adrenergic agonist attenuation of ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects. We report on a double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of the effect of the alpha‐2 agonist, dexmedetomidine, on the psychotomimetic effects of ketamine in children receiving single‐dose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine treatment for conscious sedation during limb fracture reductions in an emergency department (ED) setting. The study hypothesized 1) ketamine‐induced psychotomimetic effects, and 2) attenuation of psychotomimetic effects with a) younger age and b) pretreatment using dexmedetomidine. Methods: Children ages 7‐17 years undergoing clinically indicated ketamine sedation for orthopedic fracture reduction in the ED were randomized (stratified to achieve approximately equal numbers of <12 vs. >12 years‐of‐age children in each group) to co‐administration of dexmedetomidine versus placebo during sedation for ED management of fractures. Following initial pain control with oral oxycodone (0.2 mg/kg), medical assessments, patient stabilization, and informed consent, participants were administered dexmedetomidine (0.7 mcg/kg) or placebo, followed by 1.0 mg/kg of IV ketamine. Adverse events were recorded using a clinician‐administered adverse events and side effects scale. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale for Children (BPRSC) was administered prior to ketamine dose, during ketamine treatment, and again prior to discharge from the emergency room, with planned primary analysis focused on BPRS positive symptom change from the pre‐ketamine to on‐ketamine condition. Cognitive testing was obtained following on‐ketamine BPRS ratings. Analyses on BPRS subscale and other outcomes were performed using repeated measures ANOVA (ANCOVA when baseline values were non‐zero), using time as the repeated measure (pre‐ vs. during ketamine), and treatment condition (dexmedetomidine vs. saline) and age (<12 vs. >12) as independent variables. Results: Forty children (mean age: 11.0 years (SD = 2.3 years), 70.0% male, 22.5% black) were randomized to ketamine+saline (n =18) vs. ketamine+dexmedetomidine (n= 22). Ketamine treatment at these doses produced mild but statistically significant psychotomimetic effects, consistent with prior reports of dose‐dependent psychotomimetic effects in adult humans. BPRS positive symptoms (hallucinations, delusions, peculiar fantasies), absent in all subjects prior to ketamine treatment, were manifested during ketamine treatment, as indicated by a significant main effect of time (F[1,36] =19.98, p<0.0001). A trend‐level time by treatment by age interaction for BPRS positive symptoms was also observed (F[1,36]=3.93, p =0.055), explained by greater psychotomimetic effects in older children receiving ketamine without dexmedetomidine pre‐treatment. Frequently reported (>5%, baseline‐corrected) side effects were sedation (56.3%), dizziness (50.0%), “pleasant” dreams (31.4%) and visual hallucinations (29.7%). Conclusions: The results of this study indicate that singledose, sub‐anesthetic IV ketamine may be feasibly used n a well‐controlled ED setting for conscious sedation during medical procedures, with generally well‐tolerated adverse events, consistent with prior reports. However, ketamine treatment in children, as in adults, is associated with psychotomimetic effects. Trend level observations in this sample are also consistent with prior work in animals and humans suggesting 1) that younger children may be less susceptible to psychotomimetic effects and 2) that pretreatment with alpha‐2 agonists may attenuate NMDA antagonist induced effects on the brain. Future studies are needed to better characterize these effects."
"958","0","The Viability of Microdosing Psychedelics as a Strategy to Enhance Cognition and Well-being-An Early Review.^\nPsychedelic substances are currently experiencing a renaissance in interest for both therapeutic as well as recreational applications. It has been proposed that microdosing, i.e., ingesting sub-perceptual doses of a psychedelic, could confer some of the benefits of these substances to users while minimizing the risks associated with full-dose use. This review aimed to summarize and examine the extant literature on psychedelic microdosing. Exploratory evidence published to date indicates a variety of benefits reported by microdosers including improvements in mood, focus, and creativity, with some null reports, and a minority of people reporting selective negative consequences such as increased anxiety and physiological discomfort. Methodological limitations of current evidence, however, make definitive conclusions hard to draw. Recommendations for future research are given."
"8955","1","A longitudinal study of self-reported psychopathology in early ecstasy and amphetamine users.^\nAims: It still remains unclear whether psychopathological abnormalities described in human 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine users (MDMA users) and d-amphetamine users (AMPH users) existed before the beginning of regular use or if they develop with ongoing use. Objectives: The present study was conducted in order to assess this relationship and to overcome previous methodological shortcomings. Methods: A longitudinal cohort study in 96 beginning MDMA and d-amphetamine users between 2006 and 2011 with a follow-up duration of 24 months. In order to explore the impact of MDMA and AMPH use on self-reported psychopathology (measured by the Symptom Checklist-90-Revised), mixed models for repeated measures were fitted. In order to examine the impact of previous psychopathology on subsequent use, partial correlation analyses and linear regression analyses were applied. Results: Over the course of the 2-year follow-up period, 31 subjects used neither MDMA nor AMPH (non-users); 65 subjects used both MDMA and AMPH: 37 subjects used between 1 and 14 tablets of MDMA and 28 subjects used 15 or more tablets of MDMA. Thirty-three subjects used between 1 and 14 g of AMPH, and 32 subjects used 15 g or more. No associations concerning MDMA/AMPH use and development of self-reported psychopathology were found. However, there was a significant relationship between globally increased self-reported psychopathology - particularly psychoticism - at the beginning of the study and subsequent AMPH use. Conclusions: The data of the present study suggest that a certain psychopathological profile could form a risk factor for later use of amphetamines."
"625","1","Facing death, returning to life: A qualitative analysis of MDMA-assisted therapy for anxiety associated with life-threatening illness.^\nAnxiety associated with life-threatening illness (LTI) is a pervasive mental health issue with a wide impact. A spectrum of traditional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are available, but offer varying success in reducing symptoms and improving quality of life. We explore a novel therapy for this condition by assessing prominent thematic elements from participant narrative accounts of a pilot phase 2 clinical trial of 3,4 Methylenedioxymethamphetamine-Assisted Therapy (MDMA-AT) for treating anxiety associated with LTI. Semi-structured qualitative interviews were conducted with a subset of adult participants 3 months following completion of this trial. This qualitative analysis sought to complement, clarify, and expand upon the quantitative findings obtained from the clinical trial to further understand the process and outcomes of the treatment. Interviews were coded and analyzed using an Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) methodological framework. Participants described in detail their experiences from before, during and after the trial, which were analyzed and categorized into thematic clusters. Specifically, participants explored what they felt were important elements of the therapeutic process including processing trauma and grief, exploring mystical and existential experiences, engaging with the present moment with reduced physiological activation, and facing illness and existential fears. Outcomes of the treatment included increased ability to cope with LTI, reduced psychological symptoms, improved vitality and quality of life, and feeling more resourced. Participant narratives also showed a reconnection to life and greater emotional resilience in response to trauma and medical relapse. These findings are compared to similar treatments for the same indication. Limitations and challenges encountered in conducting this study are discussed along with implications for theory and clinical treatment."

(see record [rid]2019-70053-001[/rid]). The studies by George et al. and Ochs-Ross et al. are the only two placebo-controlled, doubleblinded, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of using ketamine for treatment-resistant depression in the geriatric population. Unlike the case reports that preceded them, these studies assessed the benefits of a dose titration strategy rather than a fixed dose, shared a more homogenous patient profile, and standardized the timing of the intervention in relation to the patient’s course of illness. In addition to tracking patient response to the acute phase of ketamine delivery, both studies assessed how the frequency and duration of treatment affected a patient’s time to relapse and tolerability to treatment, which may offer clues for developing future maintenance protocols. The RCTs demonstrated an attenuation of symptom improvement with an overall sustained reduction of Montgomery–Asberg Depression Rating Scale scores with repeated ketamine dosing that were not seen in the earlier case reports. Key differences in subject profile were noted between the case reports and RCTs and therefore may have contributed to the variance of these results.

"7665","0","A Comparative Review of the Neuro-Psychopharmacology of Hallucinogen-Induced Altered States of Consciousness: The Uniqueness of Some Hallucinogens.^\nAltered states of consciousness induced by hallucinogens (H-ASC) is still a vaguely understood phenomenon. Taken the diverse psychological effects they exert, the main mechanism of action of hallucinogens; LSD, ibogaine, THC, PCP, MDMA, methamphetamine, mescaline, psilocybin and DMT, of which psychological effects are discussed in the article, are not properly understood and explained by the modern methods of neuroscience due to the lack of vigorous research. The involvement of some receptors, such as, 5-HT2 (and probably other 5-HT receptors), glutamate and dopamine receptors, adrenergic and cannabinoid receptors, is one of the mechanisms, however it is not easy to explain such incongruent psychological effects by only receptor and neurotransmitter systems alone, since H-ASCs have, sometimes, their own unity and gestalt, unfolding the subconscious, in the ""voyages"" they induce, although the perception may, or may not, be distorted depending on the person, and ""set and setting"". They induce visual, tactile and auditory hallucinations; synesthesia; perception of fractals, geometrical and kaleidoscopic images with vivid colors; perception of two dimensional pictures as three dimensional, animated and moving; distortions and alterations in the body perception; alterations in the perceptions of temporal-spatial continuum and time; changes in the perception of the ego and the self; feelings of unification with nature and universe, peak experiences mimicking satori or nirvana-, ecstasy, rapture, extreme euphoria, excitement and happiness, oceanic bliss, self-fulfillment, referred as ""good trip"", as well as, dysphoria, anxiety, mania, delirium, psychosis, acute schizophrenia, collapse of the self, known as ""bad trip""; depending upon the mood, affection and psychology of the person, and ""set and setting"". Mysticomimetic effects of H-ASCs, imitate the consciousness states of ancient mystics, probably, by means of activating prefrontal cortex, limbic system and the right temporal lobe. A hypothetical ""holographic brain theory"" may give some extra insights about the explanation of some of the effects of H-ASCs. It should be taken into account that H-ASCs, can be accepted as a good tool to investigate the nature of consciousness, brain and the human psyche, as well as some of the H-ASCs are good models of psychosis, too. More detailed scientific research should be performed to understand the basic and real mechanisms of H-ASCs, to comprehend and unravel the mystery of human mind and consciousness, since scientific medical research on hallucinogens has been legalized since 1992."
"199","0","Modeling ""psychosis"" in vitro by inducing disordered neuronal network activity in cortical brain slices.^\nINTRODUCTION: Dysregulation of neuronal networks has been suggested to underlie the cognitive and perceptual abnormalities observed schizophrenia. DISCUSSIONS: An in vitro model of psychosis is proposed based on the two different approaches to cause aberrant network activity in layer V pyramidal cells of prefrontal brain slices: (1) psychedelic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide and (2) minimal GABA(A) receptor antagonism, modeling the GABA interneuron deficit in schizophrenia. A test of this model would be to determine if drugs that normalize aberrant networks in brain slices have efficacy in the treatment of schizophrenia. Selective agonists of glutamate mGlu2/3 metabotropic receptors, which are highly effective in suppressing aberrant network activity in slices, are the most advanced toward reaching that clinical endpoint. In accord with the model, a recent phase II clinical trial shows that an mGlu2/3 receptor agonist is equivalent in efficacy to a standard antipsychotic drug for both negative and positive symptoms in schizophrenic patients, but without the usual side effects. D1/5 dopamine receptor agonists are also effective in normalizing aberrant network activity induced by both hallucinogens and minimal GABA(A) antagonism; clinical efficacy remains to be determined. A general model of network regulation is presented, involving astrocytes, GABA interneurons, and glutamatergic pyramidal cells, revealing a wide range of potential sites hitherto not considered as therapeutic targets."
"1864","1","Psychedelic Treatment for Trauma-Related Psychological and Cognitive Impairment Among US Special Operations Forces Veterans.^\nBACKGROUND: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans are at increased risk for a variety of mental health problems and cognitive impairment associated with military service. Current treatments are lacking in effectiveness and adherence. Therefore, this study examined psychedelic treatment with ibogaine and 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine for trauma-related psychological and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans. METHOD: We conducted a survey of Veterans who completed a specific psychedelic clinical program in Mexico between 2017 and 2019. Questions probed retrospective reports of mental health and cognitive functioning during the 30 days before and 30 days after treatment. A total of 65 people completed treatment during this time frame and were eligible for contact. Of these, 51 (78%) completed the survey and were included in data analyses (mean age = 40; male = 96%; married = 55%; Caucasian/White = 92%; Operation Enduring Freedom/Operation Iraqi Freedom Service = 96%). RESULTS: Results indicated significant and very large reductions in retrospective report of suicidal ideation (p < .001; d = -1.9), cognitive impairment (p < .001; d = -2.8), and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (p < .001; d = -3.6), depression (p < .001; d = -3.7), and anxiety (p < .001; d = -3.1). Results also showed a significant and large increase in retrospective report of psychological flexibility (p < .001; d = 2.9) from before-to-after the psychedelic treatment. Increases in the retrospective report of psychological flexibility were strongly associated with retrospective report of reductions in cognitive impairment, and symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder, depression, and anxiety (rs range -0.61 to -0.75; p < .001). Additionally, most participants rated the psychedelic experiences as one of the top five personally meaningful (84%), spiritually significant (88%), and psychologically insightful (86%) experiences of their lives.Limitations: Several limitations should be considered including the retrospective, self-report, survey design of the study, and the lack of randomization and blinding, thus making these finding preliminary. CONCLUSION: U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans may have unique treatment needs because of the sequela of problems associated with repeated trauma exposure and the nature of the exposure. Psychedelic-assisted therapy with these under-researched psychedelics may hold unique promise for this population. However, controlled studies are needed to determine whether this treatment is efficacious in relieving mental health and cognitive impairment among U.S. Special Operations Forces Veterans."
"8287","1","Evaluation of clinical factors associated with adverse drug events in patients receiving sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions.^\nIntroduction: Sub-anesthetic ketamine is frequently used as an analgesic to reduce perioperative opioid consumption and has also been shown to have antidepressant effects. Side effects of ketamine include dizziness, diplopia, nystagmus, and psychomimetic effects. It is unclear what clinical factors may be associated with ketamine-related adverse drug events (ADEs). Methods: We performed a retrospective review of 95 patients who received sub-anesthetic ketamine infusions at our institution. Data examined associations between ketamine-related ADEs and various clinical characteristics including chronic pain, depression, or psychiatric disorder, patient physical characteristics, chronic opioid use, perioperative opioid use, dose and duration of ketamine infusions, pain scores, and perioperative medications such as serotonergic agents, central nervous system (CNS) depressants, and analgesics. Results: Overall incidence of ketamine-related ADEs was 29.5% and the incidence of psychomimetic effects was 14.8%. We observed that patients with a history of depression have a lower incidence of ketamine-related ADEs compared to patients without a history of depression (10.3% vs 37.3%; p value = 0.007). Conclusion: Patients with depression were found to have a statistically significant reduction in the incidence of ketamine-related ADEs. We found no statistically significant positive associations between ketamine-related ADEs and other clinical factors such as a history of chronic pain, psychiatric disease, patient physical characteristics, perioperative opioid use, dose of ketamine infusion, or co-administration of other CNS depressants."
"6037","1","Ketamine in the Treatment of Suicidal Depression.^\nPatients currently taking psychiatric medications may continue them during the study. However, if a patient is taking a benzodiazepine (such as Ativan, Klonopin, or Xanax), they will be able to take up to 2mg per day of Lorazepam during the week before the infusion, but none will be permitted in the 24 hours pre‐infusion. Also, Zolpidem (Ambien) will not be permitted in the 24 hours pre‐infusion. If a person chooses to participate, their dose of benzodiazepine may need to be reduced so that they can do without it during the 24 hours pre‐infusion. Depressed participants are randomly assigned to receive a single dose of Ketamine(0.5 mg/kg) or Midazolam (0.02 mg/kg), which is given slowly, in a vein, over about 40 minutes. The study is ""double‐blind,"" meaning patients and study staff will not know which medication is in the infusion. If a patient does not respond to the first infusion, and s/he received Midazolam, then s/he will be offered the option of a second infusion, this time with Ketamine (0.5 mg/kg). S/he will then start treatment with a standard antidepressant, unless s/he is not already taking one. After the infusion(s), participants will have weekly research interviews for 6 weeks to monitor response. If a patient does have a sufficient infusion response, and s/he is not already taking an antidepressant, then s/he will receive 6‐weeks antidepressant research treatment with Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, or Escitalopram, followed by open clinical treatment. However, if s/he is already taking an antidepressant, then s/he will receive open treatment. If s/he does not have a sufficient infusion response, then s/he will receive open treatment. Participation in this study requires a brief inpatient stay, at no cost, at the New York State Psychiatric Institute (NYSPI). Eligible participants enrolled in this study will be offered medication management visits at no cost for a total of up to 6 months from the date of enrollment combining inpatient and outpatient treatment. Study medications (Sertraline, Fluoxetine, Paroxetine, Escitalopram, Lorazepam, Zolpidem) will be at no cost during the 6 months. The study will not provide other medications at no cost."
"8611","1","Cytokine- and Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor-Related Gene-Based Genome-Wide Association Study of Low-Dose Ketamine Infusion in Patients with Treatment-Resistant Depression.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Ketamine may work as an anti-inflammatory agent, and it increases the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in patients with treatment-resistant depression. However, whether genes related to pro-inflammatory and anti-inflammatory cytokines and VEGF may predict the treatment response to ketamine remains unknown.Therefore the aim of this study was to analyze whether specific genes related to inflammatory processes and VEGF were associated with treatment response to low-dose ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant depression. METHODS: Based on the genome data from our clinical trial, this study was a secondary analysis of candidate genes correlated with different timepoints of depressive symptoms. In total, 65 patients with treatment-resistant depression (n = 21 for ketamine 0.5 mg/kg, 20 for ketamine 0.2 mg/kg, and 24 for normal saline) were genotyped for 684,616 single nucleotide polymorphisms. Genes associated with 80 cytokines (i.e., interleukin [IL]-1, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, and adiponectin) and VEGF (i.e., VEGF and VEGF receptors) were selected for the gene-based genome-wide association study on the antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion. RESULTS: Specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, including rs2540315 and rs75746675 in IL1R1 and rs79568085 in VEGFC, were related to the rapid (within 240 min) antidepressant effect of a ketamine infusion; specific single nucleotide polymorphisms, such as Affx-20131665 in PIGF and rs8179353, rs8179353, and rs8179353 in TNFRSF8, were associated with the sustained (up to 2 weeks) antidepressant effect of low-dose (combined 0.5 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg) ketamine. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings further revealed that genes related to both anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory cytokines (i.e., IL-1, IL-2, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-α, C-reactive protein, and adiponectin) and VEGF-FLK signaling predicted the treatment response to a ketamine infusion in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The synergic modulation of inflammatory and VEGF systems may contribute to the antidepressant effect of ketamine.

"4848","1","Clonazepam treatment of lysergic acid diethylamide-induced hallucinogen persisting perception disorder with anxiety features.^\nAn unique and intriguing characteristic of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and LSD-like substances is the recurrence of some of the symptoms which appear during the intoxication, in the absence of recent intake of hallucinogens. Hallucinogen persisting perception disorder (HPPD) is a condition in which the re-experiencing of one or more perceptual symptoms causes significant distress or impairment in social, occupational or other important areas of functioning and may be extremely debilitating. Benzodiazepines are one of the recommended agents for the treatment of HPPD but it is unclear which of them may be more helpful. The goal of our investigation was to assess the efficacy of clonazepam in the treatment of LSD-induced HPPD. Sixteen patients fulfilled entrance criteria. All complained of HPPD with anxiety features for at least 3 months and were drug free at least 3 months. They received clonazepam 2 mg/day for 2 months. Follow-up was continued for 6 months. They were weekly evaluated during the 2 months of clonazepam administration and monthly during the follow-up period using the Clinical Global Impression Scale, a Self-report Scale and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale. Patients reported a significant relief and the presence of only mild symptomatology during the clonazepam administration. This improvement was clearly sustained and persisted during a 6-month follow-up period. This study suggests that high potency benzodiazepines like clonazepam, which has serotonergic properties, may be more effective than low-potency benzodiazepines in the treatment of some patients with LSD-induced HPPD."
"2724","1","Superstitious conditioning as a model of delusion formation following chronic but not acute ketamine in humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has previously been shown to induce delusion-like or referential beliefs, both acutely in healthy volunteers and naturalistically among nonintoxicated users of the drug. Delusions are theoretically underpinned by increased superstitious conditioning or the erroneous reinforcement of random events. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Using a novel and objectively measured superstitious conditioning task, experiment 1 assessed healthy volunteers before and during placebo (n = 16), low-dose (n = 15), and high-dose ketamine (n = 16) under randomized and double-blind conditions. Experiment 2 used the same task to compare ketamine users (n = 18), polydrug controls (n = 19), and nondrug-using controls (n = 17). RESULTS: In experiment 1, ketamine produced dose-dependent psychotomimetic effects but did not cause changes in superstitious conditioning. Experiment 2 found increased levels of superstitious conditioning among ketamine users compared to polydrug and nondrug-using controls, respectively, as evidenced by both objective task responses and subjective beliefs following the task. CONCLUSIONS: Results indicate that chronic but not acute exposure to ketamine may increase the propensity to adopt superstitious conditioning. These findings are discussed in terms of acute and chronic ketamine models of delusion-like belief formation in schizophrenia."
"7472","1","Understanding pathways to stimulant use: a mixed-methods examination of the individual, social and cultural factors shaping illicit stimulant use across Europe (ATTUNE): study protocol.^\nINTRODUCTION: Amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) including amphetamine, methylenedioxymethamphetamine/'ecstasy', methamphetamine, synthetic cathinones and 'Ritalin' are the second most commonly used illicit drugs globally. Yet, there is little evidence on which factors are associated with the development of different patterns of ATS use over the life course. This study aims to examine which individual, social and environmental factors shape different pathways and trajectories of ATS consumption. The study will be conducted in five European countries: Germany, the Netherlands, Poland, Czech Republic and the UK. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: We will use a sequential mixed-methods study design to investigate the multiple factors (familial, social and occupational situation, critical life events, general risk behaviour, mental and physical health, satisfaction with life) that shape individual ATS use pathways. A systematic literature review will be performed to provide an overview of the current academic literature on the topic. In module 1, qualitative semistructured interviews (n=ATS users and non-users) will be conducted to explore individual experiences of, and perspectives on, dynamics of change in stimulant consumption patterns. In module 2, structured questionnaires (n=2000 ATS users and non-users) will be administered via tablet computers to validate and enhance the generalisability of the interview findings. Data integration will take place at two key points. First, during the study, where the findings from the first qualitative interviews will inform the design of the structured questionnaire. Second, at the end of the study, where mixed methods data will be brought together to generate an in-depth, contextualised understanding of the research topic. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The study has been approved by the respective responsible ethics committee in each participating country. Data will be treated confidentially to ensure participants' anonymity. Findings will be disseminated in peer-reviewed scientific journals, national and international conferences, and in briefings for policy and practice."
"3398","1","A transdiagnostic systematic review and meta-analysis of ketamine's anxiolytic effects.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine may be effective in treating symptoms of anxiety, but the time profile of ketamine's anxiolytic effect is ill-defined. This systematic review and meta-analysis investigated the anxiolytic effect of ketamine at different time points across a range of clinical settings. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched to capture randomised control trials measuring the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in contexts including mood disorders, anxiety disorders and chronic pain. Meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. The correlations between (1) improvements in mean anxiety and depression scores, and (2) peak dissociation and improvements in mean anxiety scores were also assessed. RESULTS: In all, 14 studies met inclusion criteria. Risk of bias was high in 11 studies. Ketamine significantly reduced anxiety scores compared to placebo at acute (<12 h; standard mean difference (SMD): -1.17, 95% confidence interval (CI) [-1.89, -0.44], p < 0.01), subacute (24 h; SMD: -0.44, 95% CI [-0.65, -0.22], p < 0.01) and sustained (7-14 days; SMD: -0.40, 95% CI [-0.63, -0.17], p < 0.01) time points. Exploratory analyses revealed improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms correlated at both subacute (R(2) = 0.621, p = 0.035) and sustained time points (R(2) = 0.773, p = 0.021). The relationship between peak dissociation and improvement in anxiety was not significant. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine appears to offer rapid and sustained anxiety symptom relief across a range of clinical settings, with anxiolytic effects occurring within the first 12 h of administration and remaining effective for 1-2 weeks. Future studies could explore the effects of ketamine maintenance therapy on anxiety symptoms."
"8853","1","Confidence and psychosis: a neuro-computational account of contingency learning disruption by NMDA blockade.^\nA state of pathological uncertainty about environmental regularities might represent a key step in the pathway to psychotic illness. Early psychosis can be investigated in healthy volunteers under ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist. Here, we explored the effects of ketamine on contingency learning using a placebo-controlled, double-blind, crossover design. During functional magnetic resonance imaging, participants performed an instrumental learning task, in which cue-outcome contingencies were probabilistic and reversed between blocks. Bayesian model comparison indicated that in such an unstable environment, reinforcement learning parameters are downregulated depending on confidence level, an adaptive mechanism that was specifically disrupted by ketamine administration. Drug effects were underpinned by altered neural activity in a fronto-parietal network, which reflected the confidence-based shift to exploitation of learned contingencies. Our findings suggest that an early characteristic of psychosis lies in a persistent doubt that undermines the stabilization of behavioral policy resulting in a failure to exploit regularities in the environment."

We sought to determine if use of MDMA (methylenedioxyamphetamine or ""ecstasy"") is associated with myocardial hypertrophy at death. Methods and results: A matched, retrospective study using medical examiner (ME) death reports. Consecutive MDMA positive (+) and MDMA negative (-) deaths identified from MEs in 10 states and a local county, respectively. Five MDMA(-) cases were matched to each MDMA(+) case for age, sex, and ethnicity. MDMA(+) cases were confirmed using GC/MS and other drugs of abuse (e.g., cocaine and methamphetamine) were absent. Matched MDMA(-) cases were trauma fatalities with intact hearts and blood negative for all illicit stimulants. Cardiac weights were compared between the two groups. Twenty seven MDMA(+) deaths and 135 matched MDMA(-) deaths were enrolled. Mean age was 20 years (range 16-33 years); 44% were female. 70.4% were Caucasian, 14.8% African-American, 11.1% Asian, and 3.7% Hispanic. Mean heart weight of MDMA(+) fatalities was 315.7 and 277.2 g for MDMA(-) fatalities (Diff = 38.5 g; 95% CI = 18.3-8.7). Multivariate analysis revealed that MDMA(+) fatalities were more likely to have an enlarged heart (OR = 18.3; 95% CI = 3.6-1.6). Conclusion: The findings of this study suggest that MDMA users might also be at risk for myocardial hypertrophy and possible cardiac toxicity, similar to other stimulants. © 2005 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"4708","1","Efficacy of repeated intravenous esketamine in adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious depression.^\nBACKGROUND: Patients with anxious major depressive disorder (MDD) are more likely to have poorer outcomes than those with non-anxious MDD. However, the effect of esketamine on adolescents with anxious versus non-anxious MDD has remained unknown. AIMS: We compared the efficacy of esketamine in adolescents with MDD and suicidal ideation, both anxious and non-anxious. METHODS: Fifty-four adolescents with anxious (n=33) and non-anxious (n=21) MDD received three infusions of esketamine 0.25 mg/kg or active-placebo (midazolam 0.045 mg/kg) over 5 days, with routine inpatient care and treatment. Suicidal ideation and depressive symptoms were assessed using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale and the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. Multiple-sample proportional tests were used to compare the differences between groups on treatment outcomes 24 hours after the final infusion (day 6, primacy efficacy endpoint) and throughout the 4-week post-treatment (days 12, 19 and 33). RESULTS: In subjects who received esketamine, a greater number of patients in the non-anxious group than the anxious group achieved antisuicidal remission on day 6 (72.7% vs 18.8%, p=0.015) and day 12 (90.9% vs 43.8%, p=0.013), and the non-anxious group had a higher antidepressant remission rate compared with the anxious group on day 33 (72.7% vs 26.7%, p=0.045). No significant differences in treatment outcomes were observed between the anxious and non-anxious groups at other time points. CONCLUSIONS: Three infusions of esketamine as an adjunct to routine inpatient care and treatment had a greater immediate post-treatment antisuicidal effect in adolescents with non-anxious MDD than in those with anxious MDD; however, this benefit was temporary and was not maintained over time.

The fundamental idea that psychotic states seen in psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia might be attributable, in part, to abnormalities in serotonergic systems began with the almost simultaneous discovery of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and serotonin. Sixty years of study have confirmed early speculations regarding the important relationship between serotonin and both drug-induced and disorder-based psychotic states. Now, modern biochemical, pharmacological, behavioral, neuroimaging, genetic and molecular biological sciences are converging to understand how serotonergic systems interact with other monoaminergic and glutamatergic systems to modulate states of consciousness and contribute to psychotic disorders such as the group of schizophrenias. This review summarizes experimental assessments of the serotonergic hallucinogen model psychosis in relation to the serotonin hypothesis of schizophrenia."
"1456","1","Effect of Low Dose of Ketamine on Learning Memory Function in Patients Undergoing Electroconvulsive Therapy-A Randomized, Double-Blind, Controlled Clinical Study.^\nOBJECTIVES: Converging evidence suggests that low doses of ketamine have antidepressant effects. The feasibility and safety of administering low doses of ketamine as adjunctive medication during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) to enhance ECT efficacy and mitigate cognitive impairment has attracted much attention. This study investigated the effects of low doses of ketamine on learning and memory in patients undergoing ECT under propofol anesthesia. METHODS: This randomized, placebo-controlled, double-blind study recruited patients with moderate to severe depressive disorders who failed to respond to antidepressants and were scheduled to receive ECT. Participants were randomly assigned to a study group, which received an intravenous administration of 0.3 mg/kg ketamine and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia, and a control group, which received isovolumetric placebo (normal saline) and then underwent ECT under propofol anesthesia. The Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess the severity of depression after ECT. Before and after the ECT course, the Mini-mental State Examination and the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision were used to assess global cognitive and learning and memory functions, respectively. Psychotropic effects were assessed using the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale. Vital signs and other adverse events were recorded for each ECT procedure. RESULTS: Of 132 patients recruited, 66 were assigned to each group; 63 patients in study groups and 64 patients in the control group completed the ECT course during the study. Afterward, the incidence of global cognitive impairment in the control group was higher than it was in the study group. In addition, the decline in the Wechsler Memory Scale-Chinese-Revision scale was greater in the control group than in the study group. The necessary ECT treatment times were shorter in the study group than in the control group (8 [7, 9] vs 9 [8, 10]). No significant escalations of the positive Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale scores or adverse events were observed in the study group when compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: As adjunctive medication, ketamine can attenuate learning and memory impairment, especially for short-term memory, caused by ECT performed under propofol anesthesia. Ketamine can also reduce ECT treatment times during the therapy course without inducing significant adverse effects."
"4644","1","Memory and mood during the night and in the morning after repeated evening doses of MDMA.^\nPreviously it has been shown that MDMA causes memory impairment during daytime testing. However, MDMA is usually taken in the evening or during the night. In addition, it is known that sleep deprivation also causes memory impairment. The present study aimed to assess whether evening doses of MDMA added to, or interacted with the memory impairment due to sleep deprivation. Fourteen healthy subjects participated in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, two-way cross-over study. Treatments consisted of MDMA 75 and 50 mg divided over the evening or double placebo. Memory tests and subjective measures of mood were conducted at baseline and three times post dosing that is at 6.30 pm, 9.30 pm, 1.30 am and 7 am, respectively -1.5, 1.5, 5.5 and 11 h relative to drug intake (first dose). Memory performance detoriated progessively over time as a function of sleep loss, independent of treatment. MDMA added to this impairment as indicated by a significant main effect of MDMA on verbal and spatial memory performance. Mood ratings and response speed revealed an MDMA by Time interaction. After administration of MDMA response speed improved and feelings of vigor, friendliness, elation, anxiety, confusion, arousal and positive mood increased in magnitude during the night, while all these parameters returned to placebo-like levels on the final morning session. It is concluded that evening doses of MDMA selectively impair memory performance, and that this impairment is additional to the effect of sleep deprivation on memory performance."
"343","0","Maternal Multiple Sclerosis and Health Outcomes Among the Children: A Systematic Review.^\nOBJECTIVE: To summarize the available literature and provide an overview of in utero exposure to maternal multiple sclerosis (MS) and the influence on offspring health outcomes. METHODS: We conducted a systematic review by searching Embase, Medline and PubMed.gov databases, and we used covidence.org to conduct a thorough sorting of the articles into three groups; 1) women with MS and the influence on birth outcomes; 2) women with MS treated with disease-modifying therapy (DMT) during pregnancy and the influence on birth outcomes; and 3) women with MS and the influence on long-term health outcomes in the children. RESULTS: In total, 22 cohort studies were identified. Ten studies reported on MS without DMT and compared with a control group without MS, and nine studies on women with MS and DMT prior to or during pregnancy met the criteria. We found only four studies reporting on long-term child health outcomes. One study had results belonging to more than one group. CONCLUSION: The studies pointed towards an increased risk of preterm birth and small for gestational age among women with MS. In terms of women with MS treated with DMT prior to or during pregnancy, no clear conclusions could be reached. The few studies on long-term child outcomes all had different outcomes within the areas of neurodevelopment and psychiatric impairment. In this systematic review, we have highlighted the research gaps on the impact of maternal MS on offspring health."
"5357","1","Trends in ecstasy use in the United States from 1995 to 2001: Comparison with marijuana users and association with other drug use.^\nThis study aims to estimate changes in the prevalence of ecstasy use over time, analyze the overlap of ecstasy use and other drug use, and compare other drug use in ecstasy versus marijuana users. The authors hypothesized that ecstasy users early in the ""epidemic"" would be polydrug users and that associations between ecstasy and other drug use would diminish as the prevalence of ecstasy use increased. Data were drawn from public use data files from the 1995, 1997, 1999, and 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse. Ecstasy use increased in the U.S. population and the prevalence was greater in younger age groups. Ecstasy users were likely to use a variety of other drugs; however, association of ecstasy use with other drug use was strongest early in the ""epidemic,"" diminishing as the number of new users increased. Later, more drug-naive adolescents and young adults began experimenting with ecstasy. These results can orient prevention strategies that target ecstasy users.

These tests included the emergence and elevated plus-maze tests, social interaction, cat odor avoidance and footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. MDMA increased anxiety-related behaviours in the emergence and elevated plus-maze tests at all dose levels. A 5 mg/kg dose of MDMA also significantly reduced the time spent in close proximity to an anxiogenic cat odor stimulus. The 5 mg/kg dose also significantly reduced footshock-induced ultrasonic vocalizations. In the social interaction test, MDMA decreased aggressive behaviours at all doses tested, while the highest dose (5 mg/kg) also significantly increased the duration of social interaction. These results indicate that MDMA has both anxiogenic and anxiolytic effects depending upon the test situation employed. The facilitation of social interaction produced by MDMA in rats concurs with human experience of MDMA as a uniquely prosocial drug. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B.V."
"2963","0","[Acting out and psychoactive substances: alcohol, drugs, illicit substances].^\nIn humans, some psychotropic agents (alcohol, drugs, illicit substances) have been suggested to play a role in the occurrence of major behavioural disorders, mainly due to the suppression of psychomotor inhibition. Behavioural disinhibition is a physiological mechanism which allows humans to behave appropriately according to a given environmental situation. The behavioural disinhibition induced by either therapeutic dosage or misuse involves the loss of restraint over certain types of social behaviour and may increase the risk of auto or hetero-aggression and acting out. The increased use of psychotropic agents in recent years and the occurrence of unwanted effects are worrying and must be detected and evaluated. The objective of the present study was to establish a causal relationship between psychoactive substance use and occurrence of major behavioural disorders, such as paradoxical rage reactions and suicidal behaviour, based on a literature analysis. It consisted of reviewing reports of drug-induced violent reactions in healthy volunteers and demonstrating, where possible, a cause-effect relationship. Patients with schizophrenia and psychopathic personalities were not included in our study since psychiatric comorbidity could influence behavioural responses. Psychotropic agents included drugs, licit and illicit substances already associated with violence in the past. Many reports used the ""Go/No Go test"" to evaluate the disinhibiting effect of psychotropic substances; this allows the ""cognitive mapping"" of drugs. The results suggest that only alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and cocaïne are related to aggressive behaviour. The best known precipitant of behavioural disinhibition is alcohol, which induces aggressive behaviour. However, there are large differences between individuals, and attentional mechanisms are now recognised as being important in mediating the effects of alcohol. Suicidal tendency as an adverse antidepressant reaction is rare, especially with atypical antidepressants. However, the risk of acting out exists and the responsibility of antidepressant agents in the genesis of suicidal tendencies is now established. The disinhibiting effects of benzodiazepines are well-known and proven by clinical trials. It's a ""model"" of acting out, and the causal relationship is undeniable. That cocaïne is related to violent behaviour is demonstrated by its pharmacological actions on CNS. The chronic use of cocaïne induces ""a limbic dyscontrol syndrome"" based on the altered activity of limbic structures. On the contrary, we could not demonstrate a causal relationship between aggression and either cannabis, ecstasy or phencyclidine. Cannabis abusers look particularly for euphoria and relaxing effects. Aggression as an adverse cannabis reaction is very rare and occurs in most cases in association with other drugs and in predisposed individuals. Ecstasy use may lead to long-term alterations of neuronal function in the human CNS and cause psychiatric disorders. However, there is insufficient information about long-term use of ecstasy to estimate its role in the occurrence of behavioural disorders. Clinical and forensic assumptions about phencyclidine and violence were not warranted. However, the substance-effect relationships can be criticized in the case of alcohol, antidepressants, benzodiazepines and cocaïne. In fact, individual, social and psychiatric factors exert an influence on behaviour that is superior to the pharmacological effect of psychotropic agents. The most important parameter in drug-induced behavioural disinhibition is dosage, but mode of administration is also important. In addition, polysubstance abuse is very common. Substances may be taken simultaneously and alcohol is frequently combined with drugs. The combinations of substances result in multiple interactions, and very little is known about the effects of these interactions on violence in humans. Co-occurrence of substance abuse and other mental disorders is also very frequent. Multiple substance abuse should be avoided, because potential interactions between two or more drugs are more likely to cause violent behaviour. In the future, a specific treatment of these deleterious phenomena will have to be considered in order to reduce drug-induced iatrogenic behavioural disorders."

Ramaekers, Kim P. C. Kuypers, Marleen Wingen, Armin Heinecke and Elia Formisano (Neuropsychopharmacology, 2009[Jun], Vol 34[7], 1641-1648). In the original article, corrections were made to Figures 1 and 2; the revised figures are given in the erratum. (The following abstract of the original article appeared in record [rid]2011-14110-002[/rid]). Prospective memory refers to the realization of delayed intentions. Several studies have shown that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) users perform worse on measures of prospective memory as compared to nondrug users. Interpretation of these data may be limited because of polydrug use, psychosocial stressors, and increased psychopathology that have been reported in MDMA users. This study was designed to directly assess the pharmacological effect of MDMA on prospective memory and brain activity in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, cross-over study. Twelve recreational MDMA users received MDMA 75 mg and placebo and performed an objective prospective memory task during functional imaging. During prospective memory task performance subjects were engaged in a foreground task that consisted of a simple reaction time to visual stimuli (Go trials) and a prospective task of withholding a response during trials that were part of a dynamic memory set (No go trials). Behavioral data showed that a single dose of MDMA increased prospective memory failures in the No go trials, and that number of prospective memory failures was positively correlated to MDMA concentration in plasma. Functional imaging showed that MDMA decreased BOLD activation during Go trials in the thalamus (left), putamen (left), precuneus (left), and the inferior parietal lobules (bilateral), as compared to placebo. During No go trials, MDMA reduced BOLD deactivation in the inferior parietal lobules (bilateral), as compared to placebo. It is concluded that the loss of deactivation in inferior parietal lobules may account for increments in memory failures observed during MDMA intoxication.

Methods: The file records of the 215 cases who gave at least one urine-blood sample applied to Izmir Ataturk Education and Research Hospital Addiction Unit Probation Policlinic at February 2010 have been assessed retrospectively. Sociodemographic characteristics, clinical characteristics of substance use and CAGE (Cut down, Annoyed, Guilty, Eye-opener) scores and blood %CDT (carbohydrate-deficient transferring) results of cases were used to detect AUD. SPSS 15.0 program has been used for the statistical assessment. Results: The average age of the sample was 29.4±9.1 year and most of the patients were male (%99.5). The lifetime prevalence of substances was cannabis %99.5, ecstasy %17.2, benzodiazepine %11.6, cocaine %5.6, heroin %0.9 and inhalants %0.9. %10.2 patients were positive for urine samples. %8.8 patient were positive for cannabis and %3.2 were positive for benzodiazepine. Urine samples positive group had higher unemployment rates (χ2=8.72, p=0.003) and higher CAGE scores (χ2=5.08, p=0.024). %37.2 patients had positive %CDT and %25.6 patients had positive CAGE scores. Discussion: The most important finding of this study is that higher unemployment rates in urine positive group and high AUD rates in all patients. The relationship between unemployment and substance use show that social and employment rehabilitation programs with medical treatment is important. High AUD rates show the importance of evaluating alcohol use in treatment."
"5984","0","Suicide Prevention Strategies for General Hospital and Psychiatric Inpatients: A Narrative Review.^\nBackground: In-patient (IP) suicides contribute a small but significant proportion of overall suicides. Despite this, suicide prevention strategies focusing on the general hospital IP population remain relatively underresearched. This paper is intended to provide an overview of various proposed suicide prevention approaches in the general hospital, including psychiatric IP, settings, and their evidence base. Methodology: Electronic searches of MEDLINE through PubMed, ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar databases were performed to identify potentially relevant articles from inception till January 2019. The generated abstracts were systematically screened for their eligibility to be included in the review. Included articles were grouped under five broad themes: environmental modification, staff education, pharmacotherapy, psychotherapy, and brain stimulation. Data extraction was done using a structured proforma. Results: Environmental modifications and educating the health care professionals appear to be the most promising strategies to reduce suicide-related mortality among IPs. Among pharmacological methods, ketamine has shown initial promise in reducing suicidal ideations. Follow-up data are lacking for most of the described methods. Limited but positive evidence exists for cognitive therapies focusing on the immediate postadmission period and brain stimulation techniques, and it warrants further replication. Conclusion: There is a striking paucity of original research on IP suicide prevention. Given the ethical and methodological issues in carrying out studies with IP suicide as the primary outcome, there is a need to focus on intermediate suicide outcome measures, such as knowledge, attitude, and skills among staff handlers of suicidal patients."
"1528","0","Potential negative effects of dextromethorphan as an add-on therapy to methylphenidate in children with ADHD.^\nObjectives: Methylphenidate (MPH) is highly effective in controlling the symptoms of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), but some children with ADHD either do not respond to, or do not tolerate, treatment. Dextromethorphan (DM) is a neuroprotective agent which has been used in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. This clinical trial had examined the effect of DM on the use of MPH in the children with ADHD. Methods: This randomized double-blind clinical trial had evaluated 44 male outpatients, aged between 6 and 12 years, with a diagnosis of ADHD. The study subjects were randomly assigned into one of the two groups: receiving MPH alone (15–60 mg per day) or MPH plus DM (30–60 mg per day) for 8 weeks. Assessments, comprising the Chinese version of the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL-C) scale and the Swanson, Nolan and Pelham Questionnaire (SNAP)-IV rating tests conducted by parents and the serum cytokines measured by microarray and enzyme-linked immunosorband assay (ELISA), were compared between groups at baseline and at 8 weeks after the medication was started. Results: There were a significant decrease at the mean scores of both CBCL-C and SNAP-IV scales after 8 weeks of treatment, but no significant differences between MPH and MPH+DM groups. Compared with the MPH-only group, the mean scores of some psychometric parameters reported on the CBCL-C and SNAP-IV scales regarding time effects as well as the attention problems on the CBCL-C scale regarding group effect were significantly higher in the DM+MPH group. Although there were no significant differences in the levels of various serum cytokines between groups, the subjects in the DM-MPH group had relatively fewer and lower levels of adverse effects. Significant interactions were found between the withdrawn/depression item reported on the CBCL-C scale and tumor necrosis factor α (αTNF-α) (p = 0.027), as well as between thought problems item on the CBCL-C and TNF-α (p = 0.028) in subjects who had received DM+MPH treatment. Conclusion: Following the trial, DM+MPH was not superior to MPH alone for the treatment of children with ADHD, yet DM may potentially have negative effects on ADHD symptoms when combined with MPH.

Objectives: To explore mental health service user attitudes to psychedelics and psilocybin therapy. Methods: A questionnaire capturing demographics, diagnoses, previous psychedelic and other drug use, and attitudes to psychedelics and psilocybin therapy was distributed to mental health service users. Results: Ninety-nine participants completed the survey (52% female, mean age 42 years). The majority (72%) supported further research, with 59% supporting psilocybin as a medical treatment. A total of 27% previously used recreational psilocybin, with a male preponderance (p = 0.01). Younger age groups, those with previous psychedelic experience, and those with non-religious beliefs were more likely to have favourable attitudes towards psilocybin. A total of 55% of the total sample would accept as a treatment if doctor recommended, whereas 20% would not. Fewer people with depression/anxiety had used recreational psychedelics (p = 0.03) but were more likely to support government funded studies (p = 0.02). A minority (5%) of people with conditions (psychosis and bipolar disorder) that could be exacerbated by psilocybin thought it would be useful for them. One fifth of the total sample viewed psychedelics as addictive and unsafe even under medical supervision. Concerns included fear of adverse effects, lack of knowledge, insufficient research, illegality, and relapse if medications were discontinued. Conclusions: The majority supported further research into psilocybin therapy. Younger people, those with previous recreational psychedelic experience, and those with non-religious beliefs were more likely to have favourable attitudes towards psilocybin therapy."

"6379","0","Safety and efficacy of ketamine for pain relief.^\nIntravenous ketamine treatment is frequently used for the management of chronic pain, especially in those patients who do not benefit from other therapies. In this commentary we discuss the efficacy of ketamine for relief of chronic pain and ketamine's safety profile. A review of the literature indicates that only a few studies show that intravenous ketamine has analgesic effects that persist beyond the infusion period, an effect that occurs in about two‐thirds of patients. Ketamine has multiple safety issues, ranging from psychotomimetic and schizotypal symptoms, sympathetic stimulation, tachycardia and hypertension, and damage to the liver and the urogenital tract. Damage to the urogenital tract seems to be restricted to individuals who chronically abuse ketamine. We indicate the need for large randomized trials in which ketamine is compared with an 'active' placebo."
"4956","1","Alterations of consciousness and mystical-type experiences after acute LSD in humans.^\nRATIONALE: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used recreationally and in clinical research. Acute mystical-type experiences that are acutely induced by hallucinogens are thought to contribute to their potential therapeutic effects. However, no data have been reported on LSD-induced mystical experiences and their relationship to alterations of consciousness. Additionally, LSD dose- and concentration-response functions with regard to alterations of consciousness are lacking. METHODS: We conducted two placebo-controlled, double-blind, cross-over studies using oral administration of 100 and 200 μg LSD in 24 and 16 subjects, respectively. Acute effects of LSD were assessed using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) scale after both doses and the Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ) after 200 μg. RESULTS: On the MEQ, 200 μg LSD induced mystical experiences that were comparable to those in patients who underwent LSD-assisted psychotherapy but were fewer than those reported for psilocybin in healthy subjects or patients. On the 5D-ASC scale, LSD produced higher ratings of blissful state, insightfulness, and changed meaning of percepts after 200 μg compared with 100 μg. Plasma levels of LSD were not positively correlated with its effects, with the exception of ego dissolution at 100 μg. CONCLUSIONS: Mystical-type experiences were infrequent after LSD, possibly because of the set and setting used in the present study. LSD may produce greater or different alterations of consciousness at 200 μg (i.e., a dose that is currently used in psychotherapy in Switzerland) compared with 100 μg (i.e., a dose used in imaging studies). Ego dissolution may reflect plasma levels of LSD, whereas more robustly induced effects of LSD may not result in such associations."
"7681","1","Tri-city study of Ecstasy use problems: A latent class analysis.^\nThis study used latent class analysis to examine distinctive subtypes of Ecstasy users based on 24 abuse and dependence symptoms underlying standard DSM-IV criteria. Data came from a three site, population-based, epidemiological study to examine diagnostic nosology for Ecstasy use. Subject inclusion criteria included lifetime Ecstasy use exceeding five times and once in the past year, with participants ranging in age between 16 and 47 years of age from St. Louis, Miami, U.S. and Sydney, Australia. A satisfactory model typified four latent classes representing clearly differentiated diagnostic clusters including: (1) a group of sub-threshold users endorsing few abuse and dependence symptoms (negatives), (2) a group of 'diagnostic orphans' who had characteristic features of dependence for a select group of symptoms (mild dependent), (3) a 'transitional group' mimicking the orphans with regard to their profile of dependence also but reporting some abuse symptoms (moderate dependent), and (4) a 'severe dependent' group with a distinct profile of abuse and dependence symptoms. A multinomial logistic regression model indicated that certain latent classes showed unique associations with external non-diagnostic markers. Controlling for demographic characteristics and lifetime quantity of Ecstasy pill use, criminal behavior and motivational cues for Ecstasy use were the most efficient predictors of cluster membership. This study reinforces the heuristic utility of DSM-IV criteria applied to Ecstasy but with a different collage of symptoms that produced four distinct classes of Ecstasy users. © 2008 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

"3089","0","Ketamine mechanism of action: Separating the wheat from the chaff.^\nThis article discusses the mechanism of action of ketamine. Ketamine exerts rapid and robust antidepressant effects in severely ill-depressed patients who have failed conventional treatments. This clinical finding has been paradigm-shifting as there is now tremendous hope that very ill-depressed patients can be treated in a matter of hours, rather than many weeks or months required for standard therapies to take effect. However, although the therapeutic potential of ketamine has elicited tremendous excitement in the field, ketamine’s use outside of a monitored clinic setting is limited due to its anesthetic actions at higher doses, abuse liability, ataxic effects, and capacity to produce changes in sensation and dissociation even when administered at sub-anesthetic antidepressant- effective doses. Ketamine’s antidepressant action had been presumed to be via its anesthetic target, which is the inhibition of the NMDA glutamate receptor. Ketamine is rapidly metabolized in the liver via multiple cytochrome P450 isoforms to norketamine, dehydronorketamine, hydroxyketamines, and a number of hydroxynorketamines (HNKs) in a stereoselective manner. Validation of the relevance of HNK metabolites to the clinical antidepressant actions of ketamine in humans will require human clinical trials, which are currently in preparation.

"8678","1","The epidemiology of mescaline use: Pattern of use, motivations for consumption, and perceived consequences, benefits, and acute and enduring subjective effects.^\nBackground: Mescaline is a naturally occurring psychoactive phenethylamine found in several cacti and historically used ceremonially by Indigenous and Latin American populations. Broader recognition of its possible therapeutic value in Western science began in the 1950s; however, knowledge of the safety profile of mescaline and the extent of its use remains limited. The primary aim of this study is to examine the epidemiology of mescaline use among English-speaking adults. Methods: About 452 respondents completed a web-based survey designed to assess their previous experience with mescaline (subjective effects, outcome measures, and mescaline type used). Results: Most respondents reported that they had consumed mescaline infrequently (⩽once/year), for spiritual exploration or to connect with nature (74%). A small number of respondents reported drug craving/desire (9%), whereas very few reported legal (1%), or psychological problems (1%) related to its use, and none reported seeking any medical attention. Overall, respondents rated the acute mystical-type effects as “moderate,” ego-dissolution and psychological insight effects as “slight,” and challenging effects as “very slight.” Most respondents reported that they used Peyote and San Pedro in their most memorable mescaline experience. Overall, the intensity of acute mescaline effects did not differ between mescaline types. About 50% of the sample reported having a psychiatric condition (i.e. depression, anxiety, etc.), and most (>67%) reported improvements in these conditions following their most memorable experience with mescaline. Conclusion: Findings indicate that the mescaline in any form may produce a psychedelic experience that is associated with the spiritual significance and improvements in the mental health with low potential for abuse."
"514","1","Use patterns and self-reported effects of Salvia divinorum: an internet-based survey.^\nBACKGROUND: There is growing use of Salvia divinorum (SD), a psychoactive plant that produces hallucinogen-like effects through a kappa opioid receptor (KOR) mechanism. Little is known about KOR agonist effects in humans and about users of SD. OBJECTIVES: To characterize the reasons, methods, and reported consequences of SD use. METHODS: Individuals reading SD-related pages of a drug-information website were invited to anonymously complete an online questionnaire if they had used SD. RESULTS: Participants (N=500) were 92.6% male and 23.4 ± 8.7 (mean ± s.d.) years old. They had used a median of six times (range 1-250). 80.6% probably or definitely would use SD again. Most participants (92.6%) typically smoked or vaporized SD product. When smoked, the drug's main effects were estimated to last 14.1 ± 12.8 (range 0.5-120) minutes. When asked to compare SD effects to other methods of altering consciousness, the most common answer was that SD was unique (38.4%). 25.8% reported persisting (≥ 24 h) positive effects (often described as increased sense of well-being) on at least one occasion. 4.4% reported persisting negative effects (most often anxiety). CONCLUSIONS: SD is typically smoked, acute effects are brief, and persistent adverse effects are uncommon. In addition to acute hallucinogenic effects, SD may produce subacute increases in subjective well-being. Such a subacute effect would be unusual for a drug that is used non-medically, as withdrawal from other drugs typically either does not affect mood or causes dysphoria. Findings from this convenience sample should be confirmed and extended using surveys of random samples and controlled clinical studies."
"6986","1","A systematic study of microdosing psychedelics.^\nThe phenomenon of 'microdosing', that is, regular ingestion of very small quantities of psychedelic substances, has seen a rapid explosion of popularity in recent years. Individuals who microdose report minimal acute effects from these substances yet claim a range of long-term general health and wellbeing benefits. There have been no published empirical studies of microdosing and the current legal and bureaucratic climate makes direct empirical investigation of the effects of psychedelics difficult. In Study One we conducted a systematic, observational investigation of individuals who microdose. We tracked the experiences of 98 microdosing participants, who provided daily ratings of psychological functioning over a six week period. 63 of these additionally completed a battery of psychometric measures tapping mood, attention, wellbeing, mystical experiences, personality, creativity, and sense of agency, at baseline and at completion of the study. Analyses of daily ratings revealed a general increase in reported psychological functioning across all measures on dosing days but limited evidence of residual effects on following days. Analyses of pre and post study measures revealed reductions in reported levels of depression and stress; lower levels of distractibility; increased absorption; and increased neuroticism. To better understand these findings, in Study Two we investigated pre-existing beliefs and expectations about the effects of microdosing in a sample of 263 naïve and experienced microdosers, so as to gauge expectancy bias. All participants believed that microdosing would have large and wide-ranging benefits in contrast to the limited outcomes reported by actual microdosers. Notably, the effects believed most likely to change were unrelated to the observed pattern of reported outcomes. The current results suggest that dose controlled empirical research on the impacts of microdosing on mental health and attentional capabilities are needed."

Club drugs have been categorized as being used at raves and dance parties. The literature shows that each drug has different properties, users, and settings. Each drug has different adverse effects and requires different acute care protocols. Although these drugs were identified early, scientific information about them, including the toxicological tests to identify them, is still evolving. Increasing numbers of studies on the short- and long-term effects of these drugs on humans are being published, but because of limitations on research using human subjects, they may not always be as rigorous as desired and can be cited by drug users to discredit findings of harm. The lack of research-based information on these drugs has led to the emergence of web sites that may or may not provide accurate data. Evaluated chemical dependency treatment protocols using the latest research for each of these different drugs are needed. Copyright © 2005 Taylor & Francis Inc."
"6074","1","Geriatric Ketamine for Pain Management Study.^\nElderly patients are making up a greater proportion of the New York State population every year as the nation's overall population continues to age at a rapid pace. Acute and chronic pain conditions are very common in the geriatric population and it is well recognized that pain is undertreated in the elderly. Complicating this important public health problem is that changes in physiology that occur in the elderly, such as cognitive decline and impaired ability of the liver and kidney to metabolize medications, render opioid administration particularly dangerous in the geriatric population. Adverse side effects and increased health care utilization are well known hazards associated with opioid use in the elderly. Therefore, development of pain management strategies that include non‐opioid pain treatment modalities has the potential to have a major impact on the health and well‐being of New Yorkers. This study undertakes a novel strategy intended to reduce opioid consumption in the elderly. This research project will evaluate the analgesic feasibility and safety of short infusion of subdissociative dose of intravenous ketamine compared with short infusion of intravenous morphine for controlling pain in ED patients 65 years of age and older, laying the groundwork for ketamine to become a safe and viable alternative to opioids in managing geriatric pain in the ED. The significance of this project being done at Maimonides Medical center is to lay the foundation to providing safer analgesia in geriatric ED patients and moving towards an eventual goal of an ""opioid‐free"" ED. Methods: Study Design: This is a prospective, randomized, double‐blind trial evaluating and comparing analgesic effect of Ketamine administered in sub‐dissociative doses 0.3 mg/kg as a intravenous infusion (10 min), and intravenous Morphine given at 0.1 mg/kg as intravenous infusion (10 min) with a maximum dose of 10 mg. in elderly adults (age 65 and older) with pain in the ED. Study Protocol: Patient screening, enrollment, and data collection will be performed by study investigators and the research fellow. ED pharmacy investigators will maintain the randomization list which will be generated prior to commencement of the study, will prepare the medication, and will deliver it to the nurse caring for the study participant in a blinded fashion. The study will include patients aged 65 and older presenting to the ED with abdominal, flank, back, traumatic chest or musculoskeletal pain of (moderate to very severe pain) five or more on a standard eleven point (0 ‐ 10; with 0 being no pain to 10 very severe pain) numeric rating scale (NRS), and who require opioid analgesia as determined by the treating ED attending physician. Exclusion criteria will include altered mental status, allergy to morphine or ketamine, weight <40kg or >115kg, unstable vital signs (systolic blood pressure <90 or >200 mmHg, heart rate <50 or >150 beats per minute, non‐traumatic chest pain, headache, and respirations <8 or >30 per minute), past medical history of severe renal or hepatic insufficiency, alcohol or drug abuse or psychiatric illness; BMI >40; severe COPD The medication will be administered using infusion pump with a 10 minute run time. Study investigators will record pain scores, vital signs, and adverse effects at 0, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes. After patients are evaluated by the treating ED physician and determined to meet eligibility criteria, each patient will be approached by a member of the research team for acquisition of written informed consent and HIPAA authorization. The on‐duty ED pharmacist will prepare medications according to the two arms of the study: patients receiving 0.1 mg /kg of morphine ; patients receiving 0.3 mg/kg of ketamine. Patients a priori will will be randomized to either of the two arms. A list will be generated via SPSS 19.0 from 1 to 90; and SPSS 19.0 will be programmed to randomly assign patients to either of the two arms at 10 patient blocks. Thus, for example in patients 1 to 10; SPSS will randomly assign 5 patients t the Ketamine group and 5 patients to the morphine group and so on for all 90 patients. Therefore, after completion 45 patients will be assigned to the Ketamine group and 45 to the morphine group. Antonios will then e‐mail the list to Nicholas Filk and pharmacy department who will have the list and when a patient is enrolled in the study will know which medication to give the patient. Every other investigator and clinician would be blinded to the randomization assignment. Patients who report a pain NRS of five or greater and request additional pain relief will be given fentanyl 0.5 mcg/kg as a rescue analgesic. All data, including gender, demographics, medical history, and vital signs, will be recorded on data collection sheets and will be entered into and analyzed via SPSS 19.0. Development of the randomization list, confirmation of written consent acquisition on all participants, and statistical analyses will be conducted by the research manager and statistician, who will be independent of any data collection."
"2825","1","Ketamine-based anesthesia improves electroconvulsive therapy outcomes: a randomized-controlled study.^\nBACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a common and debilitating condition that can be challenging to treat. Electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is currently the therapeutic gold standard for treatment-resistant MDD. We tested our hypothesis that ketamine-based anesthesia for ECT results in superior improvement in treatment-resistant MDD outcomes compared with propofol-based anesthesia. METHODS: Patients with treatment-resistant MDD were enrolled in a randomized clinical trial with assignment to ketamine- or propofol-based anesthesia arms. Using a modified intention-to-treat analysis, we compared the median number of ECT treatments required to achieve a 50% reduction (primary outcome) and a score ≤ 10 (secondary outcome) on the Montgomery-Asberg depression rating scale (MADRS) between anesthesia groups. RESULTS: The study was terminated as significant results were found after the first planned interim analysis with 12 patients in each of the ketamine (intervention) and propofol (control) groups. All ketamine patients achieved at least a 50% MADRS reduction after a median of two ECT treatments whereas ten propofol patients (83%) achieved the same outcome after a median of four ECT treatments. All ketamine patients and seven propofol patients (58%) achieved MDD remission (MADRS ≤ 10). Log rank tests showed that both time-to-50% reduction and remission differed significantly between groups. Adverse events and recovery time were similar between groups. CONCLUSIONS: In this early-terminated small-sized study, ketamine-based anesthesia compared with propofol-based anesthesia provided response and remission after fewer ECT sessions.

"827","0","Increased hippocampal engagement during learning as a marker of sensitivity to psychotomimetic effects of δ-9-THC.^\nBACKGROUND: Cannabis and its main psychoactive ingredient δ-9-tetrahydrocannibidiol (THC) can induce transient psychotic symptoms in healthy individuals and exacerbate them in those with established psychosis. However, not everyone experience these effects, suggesting that certain individuals are particularly susceptible. The neural basis of this sensitivity to the psychotomimetic effects of THC is unclear. METHODS: We investigated whether individuals who are sensitive to the psychotomimetic effects of THC (TP) under experimental conditions would show differential hippocampal activation compared with those who are not (NP). We studied 36 healthy males under identical conditions under the influence of placebo or THC (10 mg) given orally, on two separate occasions, in a pseudo-randomized, double-blind, repeated measures, within-subject, cross-over design, using psychopathological assessments and functional MRI while they performed a verbal learning task. They were classified into those who experienced transient psychotic symptoms (TP; n = 14) following THC administration and those who did not (NP; n = 22). RESULTS: Under placebo conditions, there was significantly greater engagement of the left hippocampus (p < 0.001) in the TP group compared with the NP group during verbal encoding, which survived leave-one-out analysis. The level of hippocampal activation was directly correlated (Spearman's ρ = 0.44, p = 0.008) with the severity of transient psychotic symptoms induced by THC. This difference was not present when we compared two subgroups from the same sample that were defined by sensitivity to anxiogenic effects of THC. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that altered hippocampal activation during verbal encoding may serve as a marker of sensitivity to the acute psychotomimetic effects of THC."

In the weight reductions, we used litters with double the number of offspring to induce growth restriction comparable to that of standard size litters treated with MDMA. Litters were treated twice daily from PI I to 20 with vehicle or MDMA (20 mg/kg) or only weighed. Males, but not females, exposed to MDMA had longer latencies and more errors in the Cincinnati water maze compared to males of the other treatments. In the Morris water maze (210 cm pool, 10X10 cm platform), the MDMA animals were impaired relative to all other treatments during acquisition. Only the MDMA females showed deficits when the platform was shifted to a new location, however, both MDMA males and females were impaired when the location of the platform was again shifted and a reduced platform (5X5 cm) used. No differences were observed in the ability to swim a straight channel, locate a platform with a cue, or the endocrine response to forced swim among the treatment groups. No differences were seen between animals injected with saline and those only weighed. The data suggest that factors, such as growth retardation, multiple injections, or the composition of the litter, do not affect the development of learning and memory impairments resulting from P11 to 20 MDMA exposure. The large litter approach offers a novel method to control for undernutrition during the preweaning period in rodents. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved."
"7342","1","Between prohibitions: Patterns and meanings of magic mushroom use in the UK.^\nA survey of magic mushroom use was completed by 174 participants in 2004, a year when the sale of hallucinogenic mushrooms was not illegal in the UK. The data were collected in Edinburgh and Bristol (UK). Participants were a self-selecting convenience sample. Participants tended to be in their 20s, White-British, in education or employed; 64% were male. Participants reported a pattern of infrequent but intense consumption (47% used between 4-12 times/year, average consumption in one setting was 12 g, a high dose). Use was explained in terms of laughing, hallucinations, altering perspective (41-74%), and feelings of being closer to nature (49%). Negative experiences reported included paranoia (35%) and anxiety (32%). Mushroom use was located within a wider recreational drug and alcohol culture. Four focus groups aided the interpretation of the data. Future research is recommended into negative experiences. Implications for policy and harm minimisation literature are discussed.

"8737","1","Post-LSD hallucinosis is associated with decrease in flicker-fusion sensitivities.^\nPurpose. LSD and similar agents may alter visual perceptions continuously and permanently in certain users resulting in hallucinogen persisting perceptual disorder (HPPD)1. In the present study, the psychophysical De Lange curves (TMTF curves) were established to determine how HPPD affected former LSD abusers. Methods. Sinusoidal waveform stimulation was used and generated by a visual stimulator2. The stimuli were achromatic, with 200 troland luminance, 50° field size, and were seen under a Maxwellian view. Nine flicker frequencies were tested. At each frequency, the measurement was triplicated using the ""fusion to flicker with preview"" method3 and the results were averaged. The examiner was blinded to the diagnostic status of the subjects. Eighteen subjects participated in the study. They formed three equal number groups: LSD naive controls (age: 25±2.9 years), post-LSD subjects without HPPD (age: 27.2±8.5) and post-LSD subjects with HPPD (age: 22.4±4.2). The LSD groups had a history of LSD use 2-3 years prior to the study. At the time of testing, subjects were drug-free verified by toxicological screening. Binocular corrected visual acuity was normal in all subjects. Results. The De Lange curves were established in 10-15 minutes for each subject. Among the three groups: 1) The difference in high frequency sensitivities (> 30 Hz) was not statistically significant; 2) By contrast, the sensitivities at lower frequencies differed markedly: the lower the frequencies, the greater the difference, e.g., at 5 Hz the sensitivities of the control group were more than 3 times those of the LSD subjects without HPPD, and 5 times those of LSD with HPPD; and 3) The differences of the CFF values were statistically significant using an ANOVA (p<0.001). Conclusions. 1) LSD reduces sensitivities to the flicker at frequencies less than 30 Hz; 2) Patients with post-LSD hallucinations have the least sensitivity to the flicker perception, followed by asymptomatic LSD users, followed by LSD naive controls; 3) The De Lange curve is a sensitive, specific and reliable method to determine this; 4) Decreased sensitivity to flicker is consistent with the hypothesis that HPPD is associated with disinhibition of visual information processing."
"3644","0","Additive inhibition of human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptors by mixtures of commonly used drugs of abuse.^\nYearly, exposure to drugs of abuse results in ∼1 million emergency department visits in the US. In ∼50% of the visits, stimulant drugs like cocaine and amphetamine-like substances (e.g. 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, the main active ingredient of ecstasy)) are involved, whereas in ∼60% multiple drugs are involved. These drugs induce higher dopamine and serotonin levels resulting in drug-induced toxicity. Since GABA receptors (GABA-R) provide the main inhibitory input on dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons, drug-induced inhibition of GABA-R could contribute to higher neurotransmitter levels and thus toxicity.We therefore investigated the effects of combinations of commonly abused stimulant drugs (cocaine, MDMA, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) and meta-chlorophenylpiperazine (mCPP)) on the function of the human α1β2γ2 GABAA receptor (hGABAA-R), expressed in Xenopus oocytes, using the two-electrode voltage-clamp technique.These drugs concentration-dependently inhibited the GABA-evoked current (mCPP > cocaine > MDMA > MDA). Most drug combinations decreased the GABA-evoked current stronger than the single drug. Additivity was observed during combined exposure to low concentrations of cocaine and mCPP as well as during combined exposure to MDA with cocaine or mCPP. However, combinations containing MDMA mainly resulted in sub-additivity or no additivity.At drug concentrations relevant for clinical toxicology, co-exposure to ≥2 drugs can decrease the GABA-evoked current in an additive manner. Thus, in patients exposed to multiple drugs, inhibitory GABA-ergic input is reduced more prominently, likely resulting in higher brain dopamine levels. As this will increase the risk for drug-induced toxicity, treatment of drug-intoxicated patients with drugs that enhance GABA-ergic input should be further optimized. © 2012 Elsevier Inc."

The two studies reported here were designed to test whether surgical patients could achieve self-transcendent states and whether those states predicted better clinical outcomes. Methods Two, single-site, parallel-group randomized clinical trials (RCTs) involving knee and hip replacement patients were conducted. In Study 1 (N=196), patients were randomized to a preoperative, 15-min mindfulness of breath or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation intervention. In Study 2 (N=118), patients were randomized to a preoperative, 20-min mindfulness of breath, mindfulness of pain, or cognitive-behavioral pain psychoeducation intervention. Self-transcendent state and acute clinical symptomology were assessed immediately before and after the preoperative interventions. Postoperative outcomes were also assessed. Results A brief MBI induced self-transcendent states in a general sample of knee and hip replacement patients (Study 1: F= 36.79, p < .001; Study 2: F= 7.25, p = .001). MBI-induced self-transcendent states were associated with decreases in pain intensity (Study 1: beta = -.26, p=.001; Study 2: beta = -.30, p= .004), pain unpleasantness (beta = -.21, p = .008), and anxiety (beta = - .36, p < .001) immediately after the preoperative intervention. The depth of self-transcendent states achieved during meditation before surgery predicted better postoperative physical function (beta = .21, p = .033) in Study 1 and less postoperative pain intensity (beta = - .35, p = .016) and pain interference (beta = - .32, p = .019) in Study 2. Conclusions These two studies suggest self-transcendence is a therapeutic mechanism of mindfulness that is accessible to a general sample of surgical patients and can improve clinical outcomes."
"3233","0","Sociodemographic profiles, addictive and mental comorbidity in cannabis users in an outpatient specific setting.^\nContext.-In the 1990s, cannabis consumption in France increased considerably. So, in 10 years, the number of adolescents reporting regular cannabis use (10 or more times during the last 12 months) tripled. In 2004, an official program to address problems related to cannabis addiction was implemented. As part of this program, specific outpatient settings for cannabis use disorders were created. Objective.-We present the sociodemographic characteristics, the prevalence of cannabis, alcohol and others psychoactive substances and the prevalence of mental disorders in 90 cannabis users seen at an outpatient specific setting for cannabis use disorders in the Lariboisière hospital (a university hospital in Paris). Measures.-Twelve months prevalence of substance abuse and dependence, psychiatric diagnoses based on the DSM-IV and the Mini-International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI) results are described. Results.-The study population had the following characteristics: 67% male, mean age 27.5 (S.D. = 8.4) years and 59% single or divorced. Approximately, two-thirds of the users (67%) were students or currently working and 32% were unemployed. Twenty-two percent of the cannabis users received unemployment, welfare or disability benefits and 11% declared no source of revenue. Most of the users (63%) decided on their own to seek care at the setting. Seventythree percent of the subjects had seen a psychologist or a psychiatrist in the past, with or without relation to cannabis use. By far, most of the users were cannabis dependent (82%) and 9% cannabis abusers in the last 12 months according to DSM-IV criteria prior to their visit. Seven percent of the cannabis users had alcohol dependence and 7% were abusers. The 12 months prevalence of cocaine or ecstasy dependence was 2% and the prevalence of benzodiazepines, heroin or stimulants dependence 1%. The main substances used over lifetime were tobacco (99%); alcohol (96%); cocaine (41%); benzodiazepines and hypnotics (41%); ecstasy (40%) and heroin (23%). Four percent of cannabis users had a history of intravenous drug use. The main consumption mode of cannabis in France is the blunt. About three-quarters of the consumption is in the form of resin (hashish) and one-quarter as marijuana (grass). The average consumption of cannabis in the last six months was equivalent to 5.8 blunts per day (S.D. = 4.4) and 12 g per week (S.D. = 10.5), and the average monthly cost was 159 € (S.D. = 133) (234 USD, S.D. = 196). The prevalence of psychiatric disorders according to DSM-IV criteria in the sample is high. A current mood disorder was present in 48% and an anxiety disorder in 55% of the cannabis users in the last 12 months. The prevalence of affective disorders in the last 12 months was major depressive disorder (38%), dysthymia (19%), hypomania (3%) and mania (1%). The prevalence of anxiety disorders in the last 12 months was social phobia (29%); generalised anxiety disorder (17%); panic disorder with or without agoraphobia (16%); obsessive compulsive disorder (12%); agoraphobia without panic disorder (9%) and post-traumatic stress disorder (5%). The prevalence of schizophrenia was 4%. The prevalence of bulimia was 4% and no anorexia. Women are more likely to report an affective disorder (64% versus 41%; p = 0.04) or a posttraumatic stress disorder (17% versus 0%; p < 0.001) in the last 12 months. The prevalence of family history for psychiatric disorders was 52% and for addiction, 59%. Conclusions.- The cannabis users seen in our specific setting are a fairly homogeneous group and for the most part addicted to cannabis only, but with very high rates of dependence. Indeed, other than tobacco dependence, 80% of the users were only dependent on, or abused on cannabis in the last 12 months. In comparison with the cohort of French cannabis users (n = 4202) seen at specific outpatient settings for marijuana users in 2005, cannabis users seen in Lariboisière Hospital are older, the percentage of females is greater, they are more dependent on marijuanaand have a high prevalence of affective and anxiety disorders. © 2008 L'Encéphale, Paris."
"7126","1","Elevated impulsivity and impaired decision-making cognition in heavy users of MDMA (""Ecstasy"").^\nRationale: In animal studies, the common club drug 3,4- methylendioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") consistently caused a prolonged loss of presynaptic serotonergic neurons, and evidence suggests that MDMA consumption may also affect the human serotonergic system. Serotonin (5-HT) has been implicated in the regulation of impulsivity and such executive functions as decision-making cognition. In fact, MDMA users have shown elevated impulsivity in two studies, but little is known about decision making in drug-free MDMA consumers. Objective: The aim of this study was to examine the cognitive neurotoxicity of MDMA with regard to behavioral impulsivity and decision-making cognition. Methods: Nineteen male, abstinent, heavy MDMA users; 19 male, abstinent cannabis users; and 19 male, drug-naïve controls were examined with the Matching Familiar Figures Test (MFFT) as well as with a Go/No-Go Task (GNG) for impulsivity and with a Gambling Task (GT) for executive functioning. Results: MDMA users showed significantly elevated impulsivity in the MFFT Impulsivity score (I-score), but not in commission errors of the GNG, compared with controls. Cannabis users did not yield altered impulsivity compared with controls. In the GT, MDMA users performed significantly worse than cannabis consumers and controls, whereas cannabis users exhibited the same decision-making capacity as controls. In addition, the I-score as well as the decision-making performance was correlated with measures of MDMA intake. The I-score and the decision-making performance were also correlated. Conclusions: These results suggest that heavy use of MDMA may elevate behavioral impulsivity and impair decision-making cognition possibly mediated by a selective impairment of the 5-HT system. © 2006 Springer-Verlag."
"8315","0","A rapid method for the extraction, enantiomeric separation and quantification of amphetamines in hair.^\nThis paper presents a rapid and sensitive method for the determination and chiral separation of amphetamines and related designer drugs in hair samples. The substances are extracted from hair matrix by a 30 min treatment with a saturated carbonate buffer at pH 10 under ultrasonication. A commercial chiral derivatizing agent, trifluoroacetyl-prolyl chloride, is then added to the solution that is directly extracted with hexane and subsequently analyzed by GC/MS in SIM mode. R and S isomers of amphetamine, methamphetamine, MDA, MDMA and MDEA can be separated and detected with a limit of detection of 0.1 ng/mg for amphetamine, methamphetamine and MDA, and of 0.2 ng/mg for MDMA and MDEA. The method was then applied to 12 samples from suspected amphetamines abusers, showing the presence of both isomers of amphetamine and MDMA in one sample (27 and 1.5 ng/mg, respectively) and of MDMA in further eight samples, in concentrations ranging from traces to 2.7 ng/mg. No differences were observed in the disposition of different isomers in hair. © 2009 Elsevier Ireland Ltd. All rights reserved."
"7815","1","Depressive and anxiety symptomatology in ecstasy users: The relative contribution of genes, trauma, life stress and drug use.^\nRationale: Previous research has identified elevated rates of depressive and anxiety symptoms amongst ecstasy users; however, few studies have examined which factors increase the likelihood of experiencing such symptoms. Objectives: The current study aimed to determine the relationship between ecstasy use and depressive/anxiety symptomatology after controlling for known environmental and genetic (polymorphism of the serotonin transporter gene) risk factors for depression and anxiety disorders. Methods: Participants consisted of a community sample of 184 18-35-year olds who had taken ecstasy at least once in the past 12 months. Participants completed an interview and questionnaires and provided a saliva sample. Mood symptoms were assessed using the Mood and Anxiety Symptom Questionnaire. Timeline methods were used to collect information on lifetime and recent ecstasy use, as well as recent other drug use and life stress. Trauma exposure was measured using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-Trauma List. Genomic DNA was extracted from participant saliva samples. Results: Neither lifetime nor recent ecstasy use was associated with the severity of current mood symptoms, either alone or in combination with genetic risk factors. Rather, lifetime trauma, recent stressful life events, the frequency of tobacco use and recent polydrug use significantly predicted the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. Conclusions: These results highlight the need to consider the role of environmental factors when examining the relationship between ecstasy use and mood symptoms. Whether ecstasy exacerbates such symptoms in vulnerable individuals requires further investigation using prospective designs. © 2010 Springer-Verlag."
"6693","1","Acute administration of MDMA influences reward-driven behavior and its underlying neural circuitry.^\nBackground: The use of MDMA (3,4‐methylenedioxy‐Nmethylamphetamine) or “ecstasy” is associated with risk taking behavior, notably high‐risk sexual behavior. However, it is currently unknown whether these behavioral effects of MDMA are a consequence of an increase in risky choices or a change in reward‐driven behavior. To better understand the effects of MDMA on reward‐related decision‐making, as well as the underlying neurobiological mechanisms, we modeled risky decision‐making following acute MDMA administration. Methods: Eighteen ecstasy users performed the Rogers' gambling task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after receiving a placebo, low (1.0 mg/kg), or high (1.6 mg/kg) dose of MDMA, along with 18 controls, in a double‐blind, mixed between‐within subjects design. The Rogers' task requires participants to choose between variable (“experimental”) and fixed (“control”) gambles, following which they are given feedback regarding their choices. Behavioral analyses were carried out using the R statistical package. The AFNI fMRI package was used to analyze activation at the time of feedback, and also functional connectivity during the Rogers' task. Results: Relative to controls, ecstasy users were more likely to choose the risky option even without MDMA on board. However, acute administration of MDMA did not consistently influence the likelihood of choosing the experimental over control gambles, regardless of the (1) size, (2) probability of winning, or (3) difficulty of making the choice. This suggests that MDMA does not influence risky choices, as measured by the Roger's task. Instead, participants demonstrated an increase in behavioral adaptation to winning ‐ specifically they were less likely to switch following a winning outcome for experimental options, with increasing plasma MDMA concentration. We hypothesized that this change in reward‐driven behavior was either a consequence of a change in reward‐related learning rate, in the positive reward prediction error, or in unexpected uncertainty (stemming from outcomes that violate top‐down expectations). To test these hypotheses, we focused our analysis on regions known to process learning rates (amygdala, cuneus), reward prediction errors (ventral striatum), and unexpected uncertainty (posterior cingulate cortex or PCC, middle temporal cortex, insula, hippocampus). We found a main effect of MDMA on feedback‐related activity within the PCC, hippocampus, and insula, but not in other regions of interest. Critically, a regression analysis revealed that the activity in the PCC explained MDMA effects on win‐switch behavior. Finally, we examined functional connectivity between the PCC and reward ‐ related regions, and found that MDMA administration influences the connectivity between the PCC and the caudate, orbitofrontal and anterior cingulate cortices. Conclusions: Taken together, these data suggest that MDMA's influence on risk‐related behavior may be a consequence of a shift in reward‐centered processing of risky options, potentially mediated through its impact on PCC function and connectivity, coupled with pre‐existing differences in risk processing."

[DSM-IV]; American Psychiatric Association, 1994) drug use disorders and major depression in the United States for 1992. Data were derived from the National Longitudinal Alcohol Epidemiologic Survey (NLAES), a national probability survey consisting of 42,862 respondents, 18-years-old and older, residing in the contiguous United States. The sampling design included oversampling of Blacks and young adults (18-29 years old). Comorbidity rates and associations between DSM-IV drug use disorders (i.e., prescription drugs, sedatives, tranquilizers, amphetamines, cannabis, cocaine, and hallucinogens) and major depression were expressed as odds ratios with confidence intervals adjusted for the complex design characteristics of the NLAES. Comorbidity analyses were presented by gender, ethnicity, and age for past-year, prior-to-past-year, and lifetime diagnoses. The results showed that virtually all odds ratios were significantly greater than 1, demonstrating that comorbidity of a variety of drug use disorders and major depression is pervasive in the general population. Diagnostic and subgroup variations in comorbidity were noted. As expected, the association between drug dependence and major depression was greater than the association between abuse and major depression. The association between abuse and major depression was greater for women than men for prescription drugs, sedatives, tranquilizers, and amphetamines, but not for cocaine or hallucinogens. Men generally demonstrated stronger relations between drug dependence and major depression. Implications of the results are discussed in terms of professional help seeking, the self-medication hypothesis, and differential social-control theory."

Body image is perceived as a tri-partite construct consisting of image-properties, body-self, and body memory. Depressed patients in an outpatient mental health service participated in a DMT group treatment consisting of twelve 90-min long sessions in groups of 4–7 patients. Patients (N = 18) responded to a structured Body Image Assessment (BIA) before and after the treatment. Initially, the depressed patients’ body image was characterized by fragmentation, distortions, and shallowness of body awareness. The DMT group treatment aimed to offer the patients a safe space for exploring their embodied experiences in a validating social setting. This produced positive changes in the body image: finding a better sensation of one's body, tolerating the sensations, settling in the body, finding pleasure and meaningfulness in the experiences. BIA scores indicated large effect sizes in the change between pre- and post-treatment assessments. Change for more positive body image during the treatment predicted fewer depressive symptoms at the follow-up measurement."
"2820","1","Repeated intranasal ketamine for treatment-resistant depression - the way to go? Results from a pilot randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine research in depression has mostly used intravenous, weight-based approaches, which are difficult to translate clinically. Intranasal (IN) ketamine is a promising alternative but no controlled data has been published on the feasibility, safety and potential efficacy of repeated IN ketamine treatments. METHODS: This randomised, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study compared a 4-week course of eight treatments of 100 mg ketamine or 4.5 mg midazolam. Each treatment was given as 10 separate IN sprays, self-administered 5 min apart. The study was stopped early due to poor tolerability after five treatment-resistant depressed participants were included. Feasibility, safety (acute and cumulative), cognitive and efficacy outcomes were assessed. Plasma ketamine and norketamine concentrations were assayed after the first treatment. RESULTS: Significant acute cardiovascular, psychotomimetic and neurological side effects occurred at doses < 100 mg ketamine. No participants were able to self-administer all 10 ketamine sprays due to incoordination; treatment time occasionally had to be extended (>45 min) due to acute side effects. No hepatic, cognitive or urinary changes were observed after the treatment course in either group. There was an approximately two-fold variation in ketamine and norketamine plasma concentrations between ketamine participants. At course end, one participant had remitted in each of the ketamine and midazolam groups. CONCLUSIONS: IN ketamine, with the drug formulation and delivery device used, was not a useful treatment approach in this study. Absorption was variable between individuals and acute tolerability was poor, requiring prolonged treatment administration time in some individuals. The drug formulation, the delivery device, the insufflation technique and individual patient factors play an important role in tolerability and efficacy when using IN ketamine for TRD."

While its underlying mechanism of antidepressant action is not fully understood, modulating glutamatergically-mediated connectivity appears to be a critical component moderating antidepressant response. This double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled study analyzed data from 19 drug-free individuals with TRD and 15 healthy volunteers who received a single intravenous infusion of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) as well as an intravenous infusion of saline placebo. Magnetoencephalographic recordings were collected prior to the first infusion and 6–9 h after both drug and placebo infusions. During scanning, participants completed an attentional dot probe task that included emotional faces. Antidepressant response was measured across time points using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Dynamic causal modeling (DCM) was used to measure changes in parameter estimates of connectivity via a biophysical model that included realistic local neuronal architecture and receptor channel signaling, modeling connectivity between the early visual cortex, fusiform cortex, amygdala, and inferior frontal gyrus. Clinically, ketamine administration significantly reduced depressive symptoms in TRD participants. Within the model, ketamine administration led to faster gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) transmission in the early visual cortex, faster NMDA transmission in the fusiform cortex, and slower NMDA transmission in the amygdala. Ketamine administration also led to direct and indirect changes in local inhibition in the early visual cortex and inferior frontal gyrus and to indirect increases in cortical excitability within the amygdala. Finally, reductions in depressive symptoms in TRD participants post-ketamine were associated with faster α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) transmission and increases in gain control of spiny stellate cells in the early visual cortex. These findings provide additional support for the GABA and NMDA inhibition and disinhibition hypotheses of depression and support the role of AMPA throughput in ketamine's antidepressant effects.

"8838","0","Effect of intermittent exposure to ethanol and MDMA during adolescence on learning and memory in adult mice.^\nBackground: Heavy binge drinking is increasingly frequent among adolescents, and consumption of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is often combined with ethanol (EtOH). The long-lasting effects of intermittent exposure to EtOH and MDMA during adolescence on learning and memory were evaluated in adult mice using the Hebb-Williams maze. Methods: Adolescent OF1 mice were exposed to EtOH (1.25 g/kg) on two consecutive days at 48-h intervals over a 14-day period (from PD 29 to 42). MDMA (10 or 20 mg/kg) was injected twice daily at 4-h intervals over two consecutive days, and this schedule was repeated six days later (PD 33, 34, 41 and 42), resulting in a total of eight injections. Animals were initiated in the Hebb-Williams maze on PND 64. The concentration of brain monoamines in the striatum and hippocampus was then measured. Results: At the doses employed, both EtOH and MDMA, administered alone or together, impaired learning in the Hebb-Williams maze, as treated animals required more time to reach the goal than their saline-treated counterparts. The groups treated during adolescence with EtOH, alone or plus MDMA, also presented longer latency scores and needed more trials to reach the acquisition criterion score. MDMA induced a decrease in striatal DA concentration, an effect that was augmented by the co-administration of EtOH. All the treatment groups displayed an imbalance in the interaction DA/serotonin. Conclusions: The present findings indicate that the developing brain is highly vulnerable to the damaging effects of EtOH and/or MDMA, since mice receiving these drugs in a binge pattern during adolescence exhibit impaired learning and memory in adulthood."
"8298","1","Relationship between ketamine-induced psychotic symptoms and NMDA receptor occupancy: a [(123)I]CNS-1261 SPET study.^\nRATIONALE: Ketamine induces effects resembling both positive and negative psychotic symptoms of schizophrenia. These are thought to arise through its action as an uncompetitive antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor. OBJECTIVES: We used [(123)I]CNS-1261 to study ketamine binding to NMDA receptors in healthy human controls in vivo and its relationship to positive and negative psychotic symptom induction. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy controls underwent two single-photon emission tomography scans with [(123)I]CNS-1261. On each occasion, they received a bolus infusion of either ketamine or saline. The Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS) was administered at the end of each scan. Predefined regions of interest were used to estimate change in volume of distribution of [(123)I]CNS-1261 following ketamine administration. Two normalised-to-cortex binding indices were also used in order to study effects of ketamine on NMDA receptor availability by region, after correction for global and nonspecific effects. RESULTS: Ketamine-induced reduction in [(123)I]CNS-1261 volume of distribution in all regions showed the strongest correlation with BPRS negative subscale (p < 0.01). With the normalised-to-cortex measures, NMDA receptor binding in middle inferior frontal cortex showed a significant correlation with BPRS negative subscale (BI1 r = 0.88, BI2 r = 95.9, p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: [(123)I]CNS-1261 binding was modulated by ketamine, a drug known to compete for the same site on the NMDA receptor in vitro. Ketamine may induce negative symptoms through direct inhibition of the NMDA receptor, and positive symptoms may arise through a different neurochemical pathway."
"285","0","Are there sex differences associated with the effects of ecstasy/3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)?.^\nSex has been identified as an important factor in moderating the effects of several drugs of abuse. Given the increasing popularity of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine [MDMA]) use, it is important for researchers and clinicians to understand the factors that may influence its pharmacological actions to improve education, harm reduction and treatment efforts. This review focuses on preclinical and clinical research that examines the role of sex as an independent variable in the effects of ecstasy/MDMA. A systematic search of PsycINFO and MEDLINE electronic databases from 1966 to April 2006 was conducted. Both preclinical and clinical studies show a sexually dimorphic pattern in the acute, subacute and possibly long-term effects of ecstasy/MDMA. Specifically, adult females are more sensitive than males to the acute and subacute physical and psychological effects of ecstasy/MDMA and long-term alterations in aspects of 5-HT functioning. Conversely, males are more sensitive to the acute physiological effects of ecstasy/MDMA. These findings are consistent with research outcomes reported for other substances such as amphetamines and cocaine. Potential reasons for these sex differences and directions for future research are discussed."
"8498","1","AUD Readmission Risk Lower With Pre-Discharge Ketamine Infusion or Naltrexone Injection.^\nIntroduction: Alcohol use disorder (AUD) impacts 15 million Americans [1], leading to 5 million annual emergency department (ED) visits and 2 million inpatient admissions [2]. Hospitalization is a vital opportunity to initiate addiction recovery, and two single‐dose, adherenceindependent, pharmacologic interventions ‐ intravenous (IV) ketamine and intramuscular (IM) naltrexone ‐ are well‐suited to administer before discharge. However, their feasibility and effectiveness at reducing re‐admissions among AUD inpatients are not well established. Methods: Our open‐label pilot trial randomized participants to 1) IM naltrexone injection, 2) IV ketamine infusion, or 3) enhanced‐linkage alone. Adult (age 18‐65), hospitalized participants with severe AUD and at least one past‐year hospital encounter were recruited through an addiction consultation service at an urban, safety‐net hospital. Exclusion criteria included psychiatric instability, severe hepatic or cardiac disease, chronic or planned opioid use, and other severe substance use disorders. The primary aim was to test feasibility, and the primary clinical outcome was 30‐day, all‐cause re‐admission rate. Secondary clinical outcomes included 30‐day emergency department (ED) visit rate and 14‐day outpatient addiction clinic follow‐up rate. Results: Participants (n = 44) were mean 45.1 years‐old, 20.5% female, 56.8% white/Caucasian, 34.1% Hispanic, 61.4% stably housed. All interventions were feasible, with approximately 3.8 participants recruited per month, no serious adverse events reported, and 90.9% with complete inpatient protocol adherence. For the linkage‐alone (LA), naltrexone (NTX), and ketamine (KET) arms, the thirty‐day readmission rates were 41.2, 21.4, and 15.4% respectively. Thirty‐day emergency department rates were 70.6, 57.1, and 53.9% respectively. Fourteen‐day follow up rates were 41.2, 50.0, and 61.5% respectively. Comparing the KET arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission was 0.37 (P = 0.17). Comparing the NTX arm to the LA arm, the relative risk of readmission 0.52 (P = 0.27) DISCUSSION: A single ketamine infusion or naltrexone injection given pre‐discharge, combined with enhanced treatment linkage, are feasible and may reduce readmission rates among medically hospitalized patients with AUD, though the differences did not reach statistical significance. Our results are consistent with Dakwar et al. [3] who demonstrated beneficial effects with a single ketamine infusion compared to their active control, midazolam, among a lower‐acuity AUD population. IM naltrexone ‐ representing an aspirational standard of care ‐ also demonstrated favorable outcomes compared to the LA arm. A lack of blinding may have introduced expectancy effects for the two pharmacologic interventions. Moreover, despite randomization, the linkage alone arm appeared to be more housing insecure, male, and predisposed to care utilization than the other arms. The ketamine arm had a lower baseline daily quantity of alcohol than the other arms. Next steps include further dissemination of results and planning a larger, blinded trial. If effective in recovery initiation, IV ketamine and/or IM naltrexone could represent a novel addition to the inpatient standard of care for AUD. Conclusions: In this randomized pilot trial among hospitalized AUD patients, both the ketamine infusion and naltrexone injection arms showed lower readmission rates and higher outpatient follow‐up rates compared to the linkage alone arm, though results were not statistically significant."
"4057","1","Long-term follow-up of psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation.^\nBACKGROUND: A recent open-label pilot study (N = 15) found that two to three moderate to high doses (20 and 30 mg/70 kg) of the serotonin 2A receptor agonist, psilocybin, in combination with cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) for smoking cessation, resulted in substantially higher 6-month smoking abstinence rates than are typically observed with other medications or CBT alone. OBJECTIVES: To assess long-term effects of a psilocybin-facilitated smoking cessation program at ≥12 months after psilocybin administration. METHODS: The present report describes biologically verified smoking abstinence outcomes of the previous pilot study at ≥12 months, and related data on subjective effects of psilocybin. RESULTS: All 15 participants completed a 12-month follow-up, and 12 (80%) returned for a long-term (≥16 months) follow-up, with a mean interval of 30 months (range = 16-57 months) between target-quit date (i.e., first psilocybin session) and long-term follow-up. At 12-month follow-up, 10 participants (67%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At long-term follow-up, nine participants (60%) were confirmed as smoking abstinent. At 12-month follow-up 13 participants (86.7%) rated their psilocybin experiences among the five most personally meaningful and spiritually significant experiences of their lives. CONCLUSION: These results suggest that in the context of a structured treatment program, psilocybin holds considerable promise in promoting long-term smoking abstinence. The present study adds to recent and historical evidence suggesting high success rates when using classic psychedelics in the treatment of addiction. Further research investigating psilocybin-facilitated treatment of substance use disorders is warranted."
"5741","1","[Reliability and validity of self-reported drug use among secondary school students].^\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the reliability and validity of self-reported use among secondary school students. METHOD: Validity was assessed in a representative sample of nearly 1,300 students by analyzing: a) the proportion of questions on drug use left unanswered compared with that for other questions; b) the proportion of inconsistencies between related questions; c) the proportion of questions wrongly completed; d) admision of ficticious drug use; e) the relationship between self-reported drug use and that of friends', and f) willingness to admit cannabis and ecstasy use. Reliability was analyzed using the kappa index, the proportion of specific agreement, and the intra-class correlation coefficient in a test-retest procedure in a randomized subsample of 349 students. RESULTS: The response rate to questions on drug use was high and was similar to that for more neutral questions. Only 0,3% of the secondary school students reported having used a fictitious drug. Except in the case of heroin, individual drug use was directly related to friends' perception of consumption. A very low proportion of students would not be willing to admit to use of cannabis (2%) or ecstasy (3,4%). Questions referring to drug use at some time during students' lives showed greater reliability than those referring to more recent drug use (last 12 months). The kappa indexes for drug consumption at some time during students lives ranged from 0.65 to 0.87, except for ecstasy and LSD (0.51 and 0.52 respectively). The age of first drug consumption was highly reliable (intra-class correlation coefficients ranged from 0.71 to 1). CONCLUSIONS: Except for ectasy, amphetamines and LSD, indexes of reliability and validity were generally good and similar to those obtained in other studies. These findings support the idea that information about self-reported drug use obtained through a questionnaire is reliable and valid, although the absolute prevalences of the use of some drugs should be interpreted with caution. The indicator of consumption at some time during students' lives is especially useful in studies monitoring drug use among this population."
"956","1","Acute effects of MDMA on trust, cooperative behaviour and empathy: A double-blind, placebo-controlled experiment.^\nBACKGROUND: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is being actively researched as an adjunct to psychotherapy. It may be beneficial to trust, empathy and cooperative behaviour due to its acute prosocial effects. AIM: To test (a) the acute effects of MDMA on measures of empathy, trust and cooperative behaviour, and (b) subacute changes in mood three days after MDMA administration. METHODS: Twenty-five participants (n=7 female), participated in this double-blind, repeated-measures, placebo-controlled experiment. Participants attended two acute sessions, one week apart. Each acute session was followed by a subacute session three days later. Participants received placebo (100 mg ascorbic acid) during one acute session, and MDMA (100 mg MDMA-HCl) at the other, with order counterbalanced. Participants completed the following tasks assessing prosocial behaviour: a trust investment task, a trustworthy face rating task, an empathic stories task, a public project game, a dictator game and an ultimatum game. Participants reported subjective effects. Blood was taken pre-drug, 2 and 4 hours post-drug, and tested for plasma MDMA levels. RESULTS: MDMA acutely increased self-reported 'closeness to others' and 'euphoria' and increased plasma concentrations of MDMA. MDMA did not significantly change task-based empathy, trust or cooperative behaviour. Using Bayesian analyses, we found evidence that MDMA and placebo did not differ in their effects on empathy and cooperative behaviour. MDMA did not significantly change subacute mood and this was supported by our Bayesian analyses. CONCLUSION: Despite augmentation in plasma MDMA levels and subjective drug effects, we found no increase in prosocial behaviour in a laboratory setting."
"4035","1","Effects of ayahuasca on mental health and quality of life in naïve users: A longitudinal and cross-sectional study combination.^\nAyahuasca is a hallucinogenic decoction used as a traditional medicine in several Amazonian regions. The ritualistic use of ayahuasca has spread throughout many countries, making it necessary to study its risks and benefits. Two sub-studies were designed for this investigation. In sub-study 1, a psychiatric interview and a battery of questionnaires were administered to subjects (n = 40) before their first ayahuasca use. Two follow-ups were conducted at 1 and 6 months. In sub-study 2, the same interview and battery of questionnaires were administered to long-term ayahuasca users (n = 23) and their scores were compared with those of the ayahuasca-naïve group. In the first assessment, nearly half (45%) of the naïve users were found to meet the diagnostic criteria for a psychiatric disorder. After the ayahuasca use, more than 80% of those subjects showed clinical improvements that persisted at 6 months. The questionnaires showed significant reductions in depression and psychopathology. Regarding sub-study 2, long-term users showed lower depression scores, and higher scores for self-transcendence and quality of life, as compared to their peers in sub-study 1. Further controlled and observational naturalistic studies assessing the eventual risks and potential benefits of ayahuasca are warranted."
"8436","0","Clinical outcome data of chronic pain patients treated with cannabis-based oils and dried flower from the UK Medical Cannabis Registry.^\nBACKGROUND: The following study evaluated the clinical outcomes of patients enrolled in the UK Medical Cannabis Registry, who were treated with inhaled dried flower (Adven® EMT2, Curaleaf International, Guernsey), and sublingual/oral medium-chain triglyceride-based oils (Adven, Curaleaf International, Guernsey) for chronic pain. METHODS: In this cohort study, the primary outcomes were changes in validated patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) at 1, 3, and 6 months compared to baseline, and adverse event analysis. Statistical significance was defined as p < 0.050. RESULTS: Three hundred and forty-eight (45.7%), 36 (4.7%), and 377 (49.5%) patients were treated with oils, dried flower, or both, respectively. Patients treated with oils or combination therapy recorded improvements within health-related quality of life, pain, and sleep-specific PROMs at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.050). Patients treated with combination therapy recorded improvements in anxiety-specific PROMs at 1, 3, and 6 months (p < 0.050). 1,273 (167.3%) adverse events were recorded, with previously cannabis naïve users, ex-cannabis users, and females more likely to experience adverse events (p < 0.050). CONCLUSIONS: This study observed an association between initiation of CBMP treatment and improved outcomes for chronic pain patients. Prior cannabis use and gender were associated with adverse event incidence. Placebo-controlled trials are still necessary to establish the efficacy and safety of CBMPs for chronic pain."
"4521","1","P.217 Effects of BDNF Val66Met genotype status on hippocampal subfield volumes during ketamine and placebo in healthy subjects.^\nBackground: Restoration of diminished synaptic densities are one of ketamine's antidepressant and antisuicidal mechanisms [1]. This knowledge is mostly informed by animal models, while translational mechanistic studies in humans are scarce. For example, a study in a stress model indicated that stress reduced apical dendritic spines in hippocampal CA1 neurons, while ketamine normalized spine numbers within one hour [2]. In addition, previous evidence indicated that ketamine's synaptic turnover changes are brain‐derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) dependent [3]. In this study, we aimed to detail the impact of ketamine on CA1 and other hippocampal subfields and investigate the influence of BDNF genotype status in healthy human subjects. The study was conducted as post‐hoc analysis of a previously conducted trial. Methods: Thirty‐one healthy volunteers (14 female, mean age 25.2) underwent a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled crossover MRI study. Each subject was measured twice with a structural T1‐weighted structural MRI on a Siemens 3T Trio Scanner applying MPRAGE sequences (TR/TE=2300/4.21 ms, flip angle set to 9°, voxel size 1.0×1.0×1.1 mm). In the scanner after the baseline sequence, esketamine (0.11 mg/kg) followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.12mg/kg was infused over 20 minutes. The second structural MRI scan was recorded within the same session 45 minutes afterwards. Each subject underwent a placebo scan in randomized crossover order at least a week apart. We used FreeSurfer 6.0 for automated hippocampal subfield delineation and genotyping for BDNF Val66Met genotype status (Val/Val n=19 vs. Met‐carrier n=12) was conducted with PLEX assay and the MassARRAY. We used linear mixed models (lMM) and differences of least means squares to compare volume differences before and after ketamine and placebo. Additionally, we incorporated BDNF genotype status as fixed effect. Post hoc testing was Tukey‐Kramer adjusted. Results: Linear mixed modeling yielded a significant main effect for drug (F1,741=7, p=0.0083). We found no significant subfield surviving Tukey‐Kramer correction (all p>0.05). For the left CA1 we found a trend for moderate volume increases after ketamine vs. placebo (p=0.076, t30=1.84, cohen's d=0.39). Within this sample, there was no main effect for genotype status on hippocampal subfield volume differences between ketamine and placebo (F1,742=0.18, p=0.67). Discussion: We conducted a forward translational psychiatric neuroscience study and demonstrated a significant effect of ketamine vs. placebo on hippocampal subfield volumes in humans. In accordance with previous results in animals, we found a trend for increased CA1 volumes within 45 min after ketamine infusion, that speak for immediate effects on neuronal plasticity of ketamine. The main limitation of this work is the low ketamine dose as well as lack of stress before the MRI experiment in healthy subjects. In addition, we did not substantiate an effect of BDNF genotype status on hippocampal volume changes. Notably, the genotype analysis had subgroup numbers, which demands follow‐up analyses in larger samples. No conflict of interest"
"617","0","Psychedelics in the treatment of substance use disorders.^\nGrowing evidence from observational studies and clinical trials suggests that psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine, and psilocybin may hold treatment potential for alcohol, opioid, tobacco, and other substance use disorders (SUDs). The mechanisms by which psychedelics might exert therapeutic efficacy in these conditions have not been fully elucidated, although the subjective effects of the psychedelic experience appear necessary. Given the often profound nature of psychedelic experiences, they may serve as turning points in the life narratives of users, eliciting lasting behavioral change. To better characterize the extent of psychedelics’ therapeutic potential in patients with SUDs, randomized, placebo-controlled trials are needed, with some already underway. However, even if such trials demonstrate compelling evidence of psychedelics’ therapeutic potential, these substances may still face considerable challenges to integration into the current SUDs treatment paradigm because of clinician concerns about their addictive potential and philosophical objections from 12-step facilitation programs.

"4458","1","Psilocybin-induced spiritual experiences and insightfulness are associated with synchronization of neuronal oscillations.^\nRATIONALE: During the last years, considerable progress has been made toward understanding the neuronal basis of consciousness by using sophisticated behavioral tasks, brain-imaging techniques, and various psychoactive drugs. Nevertheless, the neuronal mechanisms underlying some of the most intriguing states of consciousness, including spiritual experiences, remain unknown. OBJECTIVES: To elucidate state of consciousness-related neuronal mechanisms, human subjects were given psilocybin, a naturally occurring serotonergic agonist and hallucinogen that has been used for centuries to induce spiritual experiences in religious and medical rituals. METHODS: In this double-blind, placebo-controlled study, 50 healthy human volunteers received a moderate dose of psilocybin, while high-density electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings were taken during eyes-open and eyes-closed resting states. The current source density and the lagged phase synchronization of neuronal oscillations across distributed brain regions were computed and correlated with psilocybin-induced altered states of consciousness. RESULTS: Psilocybin decreased the current source density of neuronal oscillations at 1.5-20 Hz within a neural network comprising the anterior and posterior cingulate cortices and the parahippocampal regions. Most intriguingly, the intensity levels of psilocybin-induced spiritual experience and insightfulness correlated with the lagged phase synchronization of delta oscillations (1.5-4 Hz) between the retrosplenial cortex, the parahippocampus, and the lateral orbitofrontal area. CONCLUSIONS: These results provide systematic evidence for the direct association of a specific spatiotemporal neuronal mechanism with spiritual experiences and enhanced insight into life and existence. The identified mechanism may constitute a pathway for modulating mental health, as spiritual experiences can promote sustained well-being and psychological resilience."
"730","0","Ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for cancer pain.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a commonly used anaesthetic agent, and in subanaesthetic doses is also given as an adjuvant to opioids for the treatment of cancer pain, particularly when opioids alone prove to be ineffective. Ketamine is known to have hallucinogenic side effects. To date no systematic review of the benefits and harms of adjuvant ketamine for cancer pain has been undertaken. OBJECTIVES: To determine the effectiveness and adverse effects of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids in the treatment of cancer pain. SEARCH STRATEGY: Studies were identified from MEDLINE (1966-2001), EMBASE (1980-2001), CancerLit (1966-2001), the Cochrane Library (Issue 1, 2001); by handsearching reference lists from review articles, trials, and chapters from standard textbooks on pain and palliative care. The manufacturer of ketamine (Pfizer Parke-Davis) provided search results from their in-house database, PARDLARS. SELECTION CRITERIA: RCTs of adult patients with cancer and pain being treated with an opioid, and receiving either ketamine (any dose and any route of administration) or placebo or an active control. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Two independent reviewers identified four RCTs for possible inclusion in the review, and 32 case studies/case series reports. Quality and validity assessment was performed by three independent reviewers, and two RCTs were excluded because of inappropriate study design. Patient reported pain intensity and pain relief was assessed using visual analog scales, verbal rating scales or other validated scales, and adverse effects data were collated. MAIN RESULTS: Two trials were eligible for inclusion in the review and both concluded that ketamine improves the effectiveness of morphine in the treatment of cancer pain. However, pooling of the data was not appropriate because of the small total number of patients (30), and the presence of clinical heterogeneity. Some patients experienced hallucinations on both ketamine plus morphine and morphine alone and were treated successfully with diazepam. No other serious adverse effects were reported. REVIEWER'S CONCLUSIONS: Current evidence is insufficient to assess the benefits and harms of ketamine as an adjuvant to opioids for the relief of cancer pain. More randomized controlled trials are needed."
"4142","1","LSD modulates music-induced imagery via changes in parahippocampal connectivity.^\nPsychedelic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were used extensively in psychiatry in the past and their therapeutic potential is beginning to be re-examined today. Psychedelic psychotherapy typically involves a patient lying with their eyes-closed during peak drug effects, while listening to music and being supervised by trained psychotherapists. In this context, music is considered to be a key element in the therapeutic model; working in synergy with the drug to evoke therapeutically meaningful thoughts, emotions and imagery. The underlying mechanisms involved in this process have, however, never been formally investigated. Here we studied the interaction between LSD and music-listening on eyes-closed imagery by means of a placebo-controlled, functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study. Twelve healthy volunteers received intravenously administered LSD (75µg) and, on a separate occasion, placebo, before being scanned under eyes-closed resting conditions with and without music-listening. The parahippocampal cortex (PHC) has previously been linked with (1) music-evoked emotion, (2) the action of psychedelics, and (3) mental imagery. Imaging analyses therefore focused on changes in the connectivity profile of this particular structure. Results revealed increased PHC-visual cortex (VC) functional connectivity and PHC to VC information flow in the interaction between music and LSD. This latter result correlated positively with ratings of enhanced eyes-closed visual imagery, including imagery of an autobiographical nature. These findings suggest a plausible mechanism by which LSD works in combination with music listening to enhance certain subjective experiences that may be useful in a therapeutic context."

The purpose of the study was to report and statistically analyze psychometric data on PTSD symptoms collected during 80 psychiatric evaluations of patients applying to the New Mexico Medical Cannabis Program from 2009 to 2011. METHODS: The Clinician Administered Posttraumatic Scale for DSM-IV (CAPS) was administered retrospectively and symptom scores were then collected and compared in a retrospective chart review of the first 80 patients evaluated. RESULTS: Greater than 75% reduction in CAPS symptom scores were reported when patients were using cannabis compared to when they were not. CONCLUSIONS: Cannabis is associated with reductions in PTSD symptoms in some patients, and prospective, placebo-controlled study is needed to determine efficacy of cannabis and its constituents in treating PTSD."
"966","0","Driving on ice: impaired driving skills in current methamphetamine users.^\nRATIONALE: Previous research indicates a complex link between methamphetamine (METH) and driving performance. Acute dosing with amphetamines has improved driving-related performance in some laboratory studies, while epidemiological studies suggest an association between METH use, impaired driving, and accident culpability. METHODS: Current METH users were compared to a control group of nonusers on driving simulator performance. Groups were matched for age, gender, and driving experience. Subjects were assessed for current drug use, drug dependence, and drug levels in saliva/blood as well as personality variables, sleepiness, and driving performance. RESULTS: METH users, most of whom met the criteria for METH dependence, were significantly more likely to speed and to weave from side to side when driving. They also left less distance between their vehicle and oncoming vehicles when making a right-hand turn. This risky driving was not associated with current blood levels of METH or its principal metabolite, amphetamine, which varied widely within the METH group. Other drugs were detected (principally low levels of THC or MDMA) in some METH users, but at levels that were unlikely to impair driving performance. There were higher levels of impulsivity and antisocial personality disorder in the METH-using cohort. CONCLUSIONS: These findings confirm indications from epidemiological studies of an association between METH use and impaired driving ability and provide a platform for future research to further explore the factors contributing to increased accident risk in this population."

Analgesic effects were evaluated using Visual Analog Scale (VAS) pain scores at rest, time to first request for analgesic (TFA), and subsequent morphine consumption. The plasma concentration of ketamine was measured with high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in the Kepi and Kiv groups. The elimination half-life of ketamine was calculated. Patients in the Kepi group had significantly lower VAS pain scores, longer TFA, and lower morphine consumption than patients in the Kiv or Ctr groups. Compared with intravenous administration, epidural administration of ketamine resulted in higher plasma concentrations from 90 minutes to 48 hours after injection. The results suggest that epidural administration of a low dose of ketamine provides more effective analgesic effects as seen post-operatively than intravenous administration.

"3903","1","Daily oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care: a 28-day open-label proof-of-concept trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Depression and anxiety are prevalent and undertreated in patients receiving hospice care. Standard antidepressants do not work rapidly or often enough to benefit most of these patients. Ketamine has many properties that make it an interesting candidate for rapidly treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. To test this hypothesis, a 28-day, open-label, proof-of-concept trial of daily oral ketamine administration was conducted in order to evaluate the tolerability, potential efficacy, and time to potential efficacy in treating depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care. METHODS: In this open-label study, 14 subjects with symptoms of depression or depression mixed with anxiety warranting psychopharmacological intervention received daily oral doses of ketamine hydrochloride (0.5 mg/kg) over a 28-day period. The primary outcome measure was the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), which was used to rate overall depression and anxiety symptoms at baseline, and on days 3, 7, 14, 21, and 28. RESULTS: Over the 28-day trial there was significant improvement in both depressive symptoms (F5,35=8.03, p=0.002, η(2)=0.534) and symptoms of anxiety (F5,35=14.275, p<0.001, η(2)=0.67) for the eight subjects that completed the trial. One hundred percent of subjects completing the trial responded to ketamine for both anxiety and depression. A significant response in depressive symptoms occurred by day 14 for depression (mean Δ=3.5, d=1.14, 95% CI=1.09-5.9, p=0.01) and day 3 for anxiety (mean Δ=2.4, d=0.67, 95% CI=1.0-3.7, p=0.004). These improvements remained significant through day 28 for both depression (mean Δ=4.0, d=1.34, 95% CI=2.3-5.9, p=0.001) and anxiety (mean Δ=6.09, d=1.34, 95% CI=3.6-8.6, p<0.001). Side effects were rare, the most common being diarrhea, trouble sleeping, and trouble sitting still. CONCLUSIONS: Patients who received daily oral ketamine experienced a robust antidepressant and anxiolytic response with few adverse events. The response rate for depression is similar to those found with IV ketamine; however, the time to response is more protracted. The findings of the potential efficacy of oral ketamine for depression and the response of anxiety symptoms are novel. Further investigation with randomized, controlled clinical trials is necessary to firmly establish the efficacy and safety of oral ketamine for the treatment of depression and anxiety in patients receiving hospice care or other subject populations."
"2817","1","Changes in inflammatory biomarkers are related to the antidepressant effects of Ayahuasca.^\nBACKGROUND: Ayahuasca is a traditional Amazon brew and its potential antidepressant properties have recently been explored in scientific settings. We conducted a double-blind placebo-controlled trial of ayahuasca with treatment-resistant depression patients (n = 28) and healthy controls (n = 45). AIMS: We are evaluating the blood inflammatory biomarkers: C-reactive protein and interleukin 6, as a potential consequence of ayahuasca intake and their correlation with serum cortisol and brain-derived neurotrophic factor levels. Blood samples were collected at pre-treatment and 48 hours after substance ingestion to assess the concentration of inflammatory biomarkers, together with administration of the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale. RESULTS: At pre-treatment, patients showed higher C-reactive protein levels than healthy controls and a significant negative correlation between C-reactive protein and serum cortisol levels was revealed (rho = -0.40, n = 14). C-reactive protein in those patients was not correlated with Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale scores. We observed a significant reduction of C-reactive protein levels across time in both patients and controls treated with ayahuasca, but not with placebo. Patients treated with ayahuasca showed a significant correlation (rho = + 0.57) between larger reductions of C-reactive protein and lower depressive symptoms at 48 hours after substance ingestion (Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale). No significant result with respect to interleukin 6 and brain-derived neurotrophic factor was found. Furthermore, these biomarkers did not predict the antidepressant response or remission rates observed. CONCLUSIONS: These findings enhance the understanding of the biological mechanisms behind the observed antidepressant effects of ayahuasca and encourage further clinical trials in adults with depression."
"8800","1","Characteristics of patients expressing an interest in ketamine treatment: Results of an online survey.^\nBackground: Off-label ketamine treatment has shown acute antidepressant effects that offer hope for patients with therapy-resistant depression. However, its potential for integration into treatment algorithms is controversial, not least because the evidence base for maintenance treatment with repeated ketamine administration is currently weak. Ketamine is also a drug of misuse, which has raised concerns regarding the target population. Little is known about which patients would seek ketamine treatment if it were more widely available. Aims: To explore some of the characteristics of the patients actively seeking ketamine treatment. Method: An online survey containing questions about duration of current depressive episode, number of antidepressants used and other comments was completed by patients who were exploring the internet regarding the possibility of ketamine for depression. Results: Of the 1088 people who registered their interest, 93.3% reported depression, 64.3% reported a chronic course of their symptoms and in the past 10 years, 86.3% had tried at least two antidepressants. Desperation was a common theme, but this appeared to be competently expressed. A small minority (< 8%) reported experience of illegal ketamine use. Conclusions: It cannot be ruled out that patients with different degrees of treatment resistance and comorbidities will seek treatment with ketamine. This stresses the urgency to perform larger randomised controlled trials as well as to systematically monitor outcomes and adverse effects of ketamine, that is currently prescribed off-label for patients in need.

"4321","0","Is Memantine Effective as an NMDA-Receptor Antagonist in Adjunctive Therapy for Schizophrenia?.^\nMemantine, an n-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist approved for treating Alzheimer's disease, has a good safety profile and is increasingly being studied for possible use in a variety of non-dementia psychiatric disorders. There is an abundance of basic and clinical data that support the hypothesis that NMDA receptor hypofunction contributes to the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. However, there are numerous randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled clinical trials showing that add-on treatment with memantine improves negative and cognitive symptoms, particularly the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, indicating that memantine as adjunctive therapy in schizophrenia helps to ameliorate negative symptoms and cognitive deficits. It remains unclear why memantine does not show undesirable central nervous system (CNS) side effects in humans unlike other NMDA receptor antagonists, such as phencyclidine and ketamine. However, the answer could lie in the fact that it would appear that memantine works as a low-affinity, fast off-rate, voltage-dependent, and uncompetitive antagonist with preferential inhibition of extrasynaptic receptors. It is reasonable to assume that the effects of memantine as adjunctive therapy on negative symptoms and cognitive deficits in schizophrenia may derive primarily, if not totally, from its NMDA receptor antagonist activity at NMDA receptors including extrasynaptic receptors in the CNS."
"7524","1","Psychedelics in the treatment of unipolar mood disorders: a systematic review.^\nUnipolar mood disorders, including major depressive disorder and persistent depressive disorder (dysthymia), confer high rates of disability and mortality and a very high socioeconomic burden. Current treatment is suboptimal in most cases and there is little of note in the pharmaceutical development pipeline. The psychedelic drugs, including lysergic acid diethylamide and psilocybin, were used extensively in the treatment of mood disorders, and other psychiatric conditions, before their prohibition in the late 1960s. They are relatively safe when used in medically controlled environments, with no reported risk of dependence. Here, we present a systematic review of published clinical treatment studies using psychedelics in patients with broadly defined UMD, and consider their place in psychiatry. Whilst all of the included studies have methodological shortcomings, of 423 individuals in 19 studies, 335 (79.2%) showed clinician-judged improvement after treatment with psychedelics. A recently completed pilot study in the UK favours the use of psilocybin with psychological support in treatment resistant depressive disorder. The evidence overall strongly suggests that psychedelics should be re-examined in modern clinical trials for their use in unipolar mood disorders and other non-psychotic mental health conditions."
"3489","0","Methodological problems of clinical trials of psychotropic drugs.^\nUp to now, clinical studies only succeeded in differentiating between great categories of psychotropic drugs, but failed to prove finer differences of effects within these categories of substances. Two points of the testing method are discussed: problems which arise when rating pathological behaviour problems of sampling psychiatric patients. A great part of symptoms that clinicians and psychologists used to consider as relevant proved to be extremely rare. Total scores cannot be taken as a measure of the therapeutic effect, because they don't adequately express the degree of severity of the illness before and after treatment, and there is a parameter of symptoms that is independent from the observer, i.e., the frequency of the symptom in different clinical pictures. The frequency is an inverse ratio to the specifity of the symptom. It is then argued that even in clinical studies, it would be possible to choose among the variety of descriptive symptoms, those which fulfil requirements of the probabilistic test model of Rasch and to take only those symptoms to characterize the degree of severity of psychic disturbance in trials with psychotropic drugs. Conclusions are then drawn from a study including three groups of physicians (specialists for internal diseases, psychiatrists and general practitioners): failure to differentiate between placebo and a minor tranquilizer was not due to the inefficiency of the drug, but ought to be attributed to the lack of sharpness of the observations made by untrained judges. A significant difference between placebo and the minor tranquilizer was yet found, but only in the group of psychiatrists. The comparison of the first 13 and the last 13 cases in the two remaining groups, however, reveals a learning process in the course of the study. The main problems of sampling are discussed, i.e.: the loss of information as a consequence of taking the mean in a group of psychiatric patients, the role of biological rhythms, which was hitherto insufficiently considered, and finally it is demonstrated in connection with two selected cases of depressive patients that enormous differences of psychophysiological responsiveness can be hidden behind very similar clinical pictures. It is pointed out that the existing research strategy is adjusted to great samples, which were composed on the basis of behavioral characteristics, and that it failed to differentiate subtle effects of psychotropic drugs. Only experiments involving a much greater display, which take into account all aspects of observation of the selected single cases and longitudinal studies can answer the question as to which is the right medicine for the patient. Psychophysiological and biochemical methods have priority over other methods."
"1254","1","Subjective features of the psilocybin experience that may account for its self-administration by humans: a double-blind comparison of psilocybin and dextromethorphan.^\nRATIONALE: Although both psilocybin and dextromethorphan (DXM) produce psychedelic-like subjective effects, rates of non-medical use of psilocybin are consistently greater than DXM. OBJECTIVE: New data are presented from a study of psilocybin and DXM relevant to understanding the features of psilocybin subjective effects that may account for its higher rates of non-medical use. METHODS: Single, acute oral doses of psilocybin (10, 20, 30 mg/70 kg), DXM (400 mg/70 kg), and placebo were administered under double-blind conditions to 20 healthy participants with histories of hallucinogen use. RESULTS: High doses of both drugs produced similar time courses and increases in participant ratings of peak overall drug effect strength. Nine subjective effect domains are proposed to be related to the reinforcing effects of psilocybin: liking, visual effects, positive mood, insight, positive social effects, increased awareness of beauty (both visual and music), awe/amazement, meaningfulness, and mystical experience. For most ratings, (1) psilocybin and DXM both produced effects significantly greater than placebo; (2) psilocybin showed dose-related increases; 3, DXM was never significantly higher than psilocybin; (4) the two highest psilocybin doses were significantly greater than DXM. These differences were consistent with two measures of desire to take the drug condition again. CONCLUSIONS: This analysis provides new information about domains of psilocybin subjective effects proposed to be related to its reinforcing effects (alternatively described as the ""motivation"" to use). Observed differences on these domains between psilocybin and DXM are consistent with the relative rates of non-medical use of psilocybin and DXM."
"5207","1","Psilocybin-induced changes in brain network integrity and segregation correlate with plasma psilocin level and psychedelic experience.^\nThe emerging novel therapeutic psilocybin produces psychedelic effects via engagement of cerebral serotonergic targets by psilocin (active metabolite). The serotonin 2A receptor critically mediates these effects by altering distributed neural processes that manifest as increased entropy, reduced functional connectivity (FC) within discrete brain networks (i.e., reduced integrity) and increased FC between networks (i.e., reduced segregation). Reduced integrity of the default mode network (DMN) is proposed to play a particularly prominent role in psychedelic phenomenology, including perceived ego-dissolution. Here, we investigate the effects of a psychoactive peroral dose of psilocybin (0.2-0.3 mg/kg) on plasma psilocin level (PPL), subjective drug intensity (SDI) and their association in fifteen healthy individuals. We further evaluate associations between these measures and resting-state FC, measured with functional magneticresonance imaging, acquired over the course of five hours after psilocybin administration. We show that PPL and SDI correlate negatively with measures of network integrity (including DMN) and segregation, both spatially constrained and unconstrained. We also find that the executive control network and dorsal attention network desegregate, increasing connectivity with other networks and throughout the brain as a function of PPL and SDI. These findings provide direct evidence that psilocin critically shapes the time course and magnitude of changes in the cerebral functional architecture and subjective experience following psilocybin administration. Our findings provide novel insight into the neurobiological mechanisms underlying profound perceptual experiences evoked by this emerging transnosological therapeutic and implicate the expression of network integrity and segregation in the psychedelic experience and consciousness.

"6716","0","Arousal and performance: the ubiquitous inverted u relationship. Comparison of changes in response latency and arousal level in normal subjects induced by CNS stimulants, sedatives and tranquillizers.^\nThe present experiment investigates the relation between performance on a complex choice reaction time task and arousal where the changes in level of arousal are produced by 8 different drugs. Within the limits of this experiment it has been demonstrated that drug induced changes in arousal relate to associated changes in performance via an inverted U function. This inverted U relation implies that the direction and magnitude of the effects of a drug on performance are dependent upon the extent and direction in which the drug produces an arousal change and the initial arousal level of the individual subject. For example, a given increase in arousal will reduce performance scores in subjects with a high initial arousal level while the same increase in arousal would increase performance in subjects with initially low arousal levels."
"136","0","Effect of attention bias modification (ABM) on chronic pain and associated health outcomes in Defence personnel.^\nINTERVENTION: This study aims to determine whether multiple sessions of an ABM using pain cues will reduce attention bias to pain cues, reduce pain severity and related disability (e.g., pain interference) and improve mental health in ADF members (serving and ex‐serving) with chronic pain. The study will be a parallel‐groups randomized superiority trial comparing 5 sessions of ABM (using pain‐related word cue attention modification training via a modified dot‐probe task) versus sham training (i.e., placebo control condition, via a dot‐probe task) in Defence personnel who self‐report chronic pain experience lasting at least 3 months. The 2 arms include: 1. Behavioural: Attention bias modification (ABM) treatment Attention training using a computerized spatial attention task (dot‐probe, DPT) modified to alter pain‐related attention patterns using pain and neutral stimuli (with the probe placed in the opposite location to the pain stimuli). 2. Behavioural: Sham ABM placebo control condition Attention training using a computerized spatial attention task (dot‐probe) not intended to alter pain‐related attention patterns using the same pain and neutral stimuli (with the probe replacing the pain vs. neutral stimuli equally often). Stage 1: Participants will complete a series of online (or hard‐copy option upon request) validated questionnaires to assess baseline (and at post‐intervention) levels of key outcome and demographic variables. Participants will then be randomised to receive double‐blinded administration of either ABM or sham (placebo control) training. Stage 2: Participants attend 1 training session a week for 5 weeks (of ABM or sham training). Prior to the first training session and at the completion of the final training session, pre‐ and post‐intervention attention biases will be assessed, respectively, via a computerised visual probe task (<10 mins) where reaction times for different categories of pain words related to sensory and affective experiences will be measured. Participants are randomly allocated to receive either ABM or sham training, taking approximately 10 minutes each session (n = 50 each). *ABM, ‘away pain’ – in this condition, participants’ attention is implicitly re‐directed away from pain‐related cues (compared to neutral cues). This occurs via the placement of the dot probe in the opposite location of the pain cue on all trials. *Sham ABM control – participants’ attention is not trained toward or away from any stimuli type in this condition (i.e., similar to the assessment task, with the location of the dot probe replacing the pain cues 50% of the time). This condition serves as a placebo control group. During the 5‐week intervention period, a brief (5‐10 min) online survey will be completed the day following each training session to assess incremental changes in mood and pain ratings. Stage 3: Online questionnaires (or hard copy upon request) will be administered immediately and at 1‐month following the final training session to assess acute and sustained or delayed effects on key clinical outcome variables (e.g., pain, disability, negative affect). Session 1 includes pre‐intervention DPT assessment prior to ABM trials (20 min). Sessions 2‐4 include only ABM trials (10 min). Session 5 includes post‐intervention DPT assessment following the ABM trials (20 min). Each session includes instruction screens and practice trials using neutral stimuli. CONDITION: Chronic pain INCLUSION CRITERIA: Aged 18 years or older, currently serving or ex‐serving Defence member, have been experiencing pain for at least 3 months, and had this pain experience in the last few months The interventions are delivered face‐to‐face by trained research assistants (with postgraduate psychology qualifications) via the experiment presentation software, E‐prime 2.0, on laptop computers at a workstation (individual testing) in an office space or consulting room at the participant's local Defence base (e.g., local Barracks office space), local ex‐service orga isation, public library meeting room, or in a quiet room at one of the QUT campuses. All participant instructions for performing the dot probe task are contained within the program, such that the participant can read these at their own pace, pause to ask any questions of the research assistant before proceeding from the practice block to the intervention or assessment block.

"7009","0","Effects of ketamine optical isomers, psilocybin, psilocin and norpsilocin on time estimation and cognition in rats.^\nRationale Ketamine and psilocybin belong to the rapid-acting antidepressants but they also produce psychotomimetic effects including timing distortion. It is currently debatable whether these are essential for their therapeutic actions. As depressed patients report that the ""time is dragging,"" we hypothesized that ketamine and psilocybin-like compounds may produce an opposite effect, i.e., time underestimation, purportedly contributing to their therapeutic properties. Objectives Timing was tested following administration of (R)- and (S)-ketamine, and psilocybin, psilocin, and norpsilocin in the discrete-trial temporal discrimination task (TDT) in male rats. Timing related to premature responses, and cognitive and unspecific effects of compounds were tested in the 5-choice serial reaction time task (5-CSRTT) in the standard 1-s, and ""easier"" 2-s stimulus duration conditions, as well as in the vITI variant promoting impulsive responses. Results (S)-ketamine (15 but not 3.75 or 7.5 mg/kg) shifted psychometric curve to the right in TDT and reduced premature responses in 5-CSRTT, suggesting expected time underestimation, but it also decreased the accuracy of temporal discrimination and increased response and reward latencies, decreased correct responses, and increased incorrect responses. While (R)-ketamine did not affect timing and produced no unspecific actions, it reduced incorrect responses in TDT and increased accuracy in 5-CSRTT, suggesting pro-cognitive effects. Psilocin and psilocybin produced mainly unspecific effects in both tasks, while norpsilocin showed no effects. Conclusions Time underestimation produced by (S)-ketamine could be associated with its antidepressant effects; however, it was accompanied with severe behavioral disruption. We also hypothesize that behavioral disruption produced by psychedelics objectively reflects their psychotomimetic-like actions."
"863","1","Multiple drug ingestion by ecstasy abusers in the United States.^\nThe abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9). In addition to MDMA/MDA, the most commonly identified drug groups (%) were cannabis (THCCOOH) (61.6%); amphetamine/ methamphetamine (38.4%); benzoylecgonine (30.8%); diazepam-related (9.6%); opiates (7.1%); alprazolam (5.6%); and others (5.6%). Although multidrug ingestion appears to be common amongst ecstasy users, caution is recommended in interpretation. Illicit ecstasy in the United States and Canada frequently contains methamphetamine and other active substances, and multidrug use may not have been intentional."

"5693","0","MDMA.^\nThere is growing evidence that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and other psychedelic drugs have the potential to powerfully catalyze psychological healing if they are used wisely. Clinical trials using MDMA are not simply drug trials in the usual sense; they are designed to test MDMA in combination with psychotherapy. This chapter presents quantitative data regarding treatment effects and discusses some of what is understood about therapeutic mechanisms of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. It also presents the observations from clinical research in descriptive form, aimed at conveying the richness of the therapeutic process that can be catalyzed by MDMA and the questions it raises about the nature of human healing. MDMA is administered orally, typically on an empty stomach to avoid a delay in absorption. MDMA is often referred to as a psychedelic or hallucinogen, but it is quite different in many respects from classic psychedelics such as lysergic acid diethylamide or psilocybin. MDMA stimulates release and inhibits reuptake of the monoamines serotonin, dopamine, and norepinephrine, with most potent effects on serotonin. MDMA reliably produces sympathomimetic effects including elevation of heart rate and blood pressure, primarily due to norepinephrine release.

"2004","1","Interaction of Sex and Age on the Dissociative Effects of Ketamine Action in Young Healthy Participants.^\nKetamine is a drug that reduces depressive and elicits schizophrenia-like symptoms in humans. However, it is largely unexplored whether women and men differ with respect to ketamine-action and whether age contributes to drug-effects. In this study we assessed dissociative symptoms via the Clinician Administered Dissociative States Scale (CADSS) in a total of 69 healthy subjects aged between 18 and 30 years (early adulthood) after ketamine or placebo infusion. Dissociative symptoms were generally increased only in the ketamine group post-infusion. Specifically, within the ketamine group, men reported significantly more depersonalization and amnestic symptoms than women. Furthermore, with rising age only men were less affected overall with respect to dissociative symptoms. This suggests a sex-specific protective effect of higher age which may be due to delayed brain maturation in men compared to women. We conclude that it is crucial to include sex and age in studies of drug effects in general and of ketamine-action in specific to tailor more efficient psychiatric treatments.

"8554","1","DMT Models the Near-Death Experience.^\nNear-death experiences (NDEs) are complex subjective experiences, which have been previously associated with the psychedelic experience and more specifically with the experience induced by the potent serotonergic, N,N-Dimethyltryptamine (DMT). Potential similarities between both subjective states have been noted previously, including the subjective feeling of transcending one's body and entering an alternative realm, perceiving and communicating with sentient 'entities' and themes related to death and dying. In this within-subjects placebo-controled study we aimed to test the similarities between the DMT state and NDEs, by administering DMT and placebo to 13 healthy participants, who then completed a validated and widely used measure of NDEs. Results revealed significant increases in phenomenological features associated with the NDE, following DMT administration compared to placebo. Also, we found significant relationships between the NDE scores and DMT-induced ego-dissolution and mystical-type experiences, as well as a significant association between NDE scores and baseline trait 'absorption' and delusional ideation measured at baseline. Furthermore, we found a significant overlap in nearly all of the NDE phenomenological features when comparing DMT-induced NDEs with a matched group of 'actual' NDE experiencers. These results reveal a striking similarity between these states that warrants further investigation."

Patients were randomly assigned to two groups: group I 1 mg X kg-1 propofol, group II 1.5 mg X kg-1 ketamine. After injection, the patients were left spontaneously breathing oxygen, and were assisted when apneic. Haemodynamic measures with a Swan-Ganz catheter and thermodilution cardiac output calculator were made before and 1, 3, 5, 10 and 15 min after anaesthetic induction. The two groups were similar in age, weight and mean arterial pressure, but statistically different for some haemodynamic parameters (Ppa, Ppw, CI). In group I, arterial pressure fell significantly (-17%) in the first minute and continued to fall (-15%) until the 15th min. Heart rate remained unchanged: right atrial and pulmonary pressures were not changed; cardiac index fell slightly and MVO2 estimated by the triple product fell (-27%) as soon as propofol was infused. There was no clinical sign of cardiac failure. In group II, arterial pressure increased significantly, and heart rate decreased; pulmonary capillary wedge pressure increased (+93% after the 3rd min) and cardiac index was unchanged. The ventricular function curve was shifted to the right, suggesting a decrease in inotropism. Systemic vascular resistances were steady. MVO2 increased twofold, mainly due to the rise in pulmonary capillary wedge pressure.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
"3592","1","The rapid anti-suicidal ideation effect of ketamine: A systematic review.^\nIn many countries suicide rates have been trending upwards for close to twenty years-presenting a public health crisis. Most suicide attempts and deaths are associated with psychiatric illness, usually a depressive disorder. Subanesthetic ketamine is the only FDA-approved antidepressant that works in hours not weeks-thus potentially transforming treatment of suicidal patients. We reviewed all randomized controlled trials of the effect of ketamine on suicidal ideation to determine if ketamine rapidly reduces suicidal ideation [SI] in depressed patients and how long the benefit persists after one dose and if the route of administration or dose affects the outcome. A systematic review was conducted as per PRISMA [preferred reporting items for systematic reviews and meta-analyses] criteria. PubMed search inclusive of ""ketamine"" and ""suicide"" yielded 358 results. Papers (N = 354) were then read by at least two authors, identifying 12 meeting eligibility requirements and eleven RCTs examining whether ketamine treatment ameliorated SI. Four of five RCTs examined racemic ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) given intravenously and found an advantage for ketamine over control for rapid reduction in SI in acutely depressed patients. Two studies examined intranasal esketamine in depressed suicidal patients and found no advantage over saline. One study examined outcome six weeks after a single intravenous dose of ketamine and found benefit for SI sustained relative to 24 h post-dose. Further research is warranted into: optimal dosing strategy, including number and frequency; and long-term efficacy and safety. Ultimately, it remains to be shown that ketamine's benefit for SI translates into prevention of suicidal behavior."
"3632","1","Safety pharmacology of acute LSD administration in healthy subjects.^\nRATIONALE: Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) is used in psychiatric and psychological research and investigated as a potential treatment for medical and psychiatric disorders, including depression, anxiety, and cluster headache. OBJECTIVES: Safety data on clinical safety are available from small studies but not from larger samples. We report safety pharmacology data from a large pooled study sample on acute effects of LSD in healthy subjects. METHODS: We conducted a pooled analysis of four double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, crossover studies that included a total of 83 healthy subjects and 131 single-dose administrations of LSD. LSD administrations were matched to dose groups according to measured LSD peak plasma concentrations to adjust for uncertainties in the correct LSD dose in some studies. Single doses were 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg of LSD base. We investigated subjective effects (self-rated any drug effect, good drug effect, bad drug effect, and anxiety), blood pressure, heart rate, body temperature, duration of the acute LSD response, acute (12 h) and subacute (24 h) adverse effects, reports of flashbacks, and liver and kidney function before and after the studies. RESULTS: LSD dose-dependently increased subjective, physiologic, and adverse effects. The dose-response curves for the proportions of subjects with a certain amount of a subjective effect were steeper and reached a higher maximum for positive acute subjective effects compared with negative acute subjective effects. Maximal ratings of > 50% good drug effects were reached in 37%, 91%, 96%, and 91% of the LSD administrations at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg. Maximal ratings of > 50% bad drug effects were reached in 0%, 9%, 27%, 31% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean ratings of Oceanic Boundlessness were 10%, 25%, 41%, and 44%, and mean ratings of Anxious Ego-Dissolution were 3.4%, 13%, 20%, and 22% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. The physiologic effects of LSD were moderate. None of the subjects had systolic blood pressure > 180 mmHg at any time. Peak heart rate > 100 beats/min was observed in 0%, 6%, 20%, and 25% of the subjects at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Maximal heart rates of 129 and 121 beats/min were observed in one subject at the 50 and 200 µg doses, respectively. Peak body temperature > 38° was observed in 0%, 11%, 7%, and 34% at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Mean acute adverse effect scores on the List of Complaints were 5.6, 9.2, 12, and 13 at 25, 50, 100, and 200 µg, respectively. Kidney and liver function parameters were unaltered. Six subjects reported transient flashback phenomena. CONCLUSIONS: The single-dose administration of LSD is safe in regard to acute psychological and physical harm in healthy subjects in a controlled research setting."
"2005","1","Hopelessness, Suicidality, and Co-Occurring Substance Use among Adolescent Hallucinogen Users—A National Survey Study.^\n(1) Objectives: Hallucinogens are being explored as a potential treatment of psychiatric disorders. Micro dosing of illicitly purchased hallucinogen drugs is on the rise despite conclusive benefits. We aimed to evaluate the prevalence and odds of hopelessness, suicidality, and co-occurring substance use among adolescent hallucinogen users. (2) Methods: We performed a retrospective analysis of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention’s Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System (YRBSS) 2001–2019 data that nationally represents school-going US adolescents. We identified hallucinogen use based on the survey questions, exploring the use of hallucinogens (LSD, PCP, mescaline, and mushrooms). (3) Results: Out of a total of 125,550 respondents, 8.4% reported using hallucinogens. Overall, the trend of hallucinogen use decreased from 13.3% (2001) to 7.0% (2019) (pTrend < 0.0001). Hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad and hopeless (aOR: 1.40; 95%CI: 1.21–1.61; p < 0.0001), considering suicide (aOR: 1.36; 95%CI: 1.08–1.70; p = 0.009), and planning suicide (aOR: 1.49; 95%CI: 1.19–1.86; p = 0.001). Additionally, adolescent hallucinogen users had a higher prevalence of alcohol, cigarette, e-cigarette, marijuana, synthetic marijuana, inhalants, heroin, cocaine, methamphetamine, and ecstasy use. (4) Conclusions: The overall trend of hallucinogen use decreased among school-going American adolescents. We found a high prevalence of co-occurring substance use among hallucinogen users. We found that hallucinogen users were at high odds of feeling sad, hopeless, and considering and planning suicide. Further research is needed to explore the effects of recreational hallucinogen use among the adolescent population."
"3006","1","Knowledge, Perceptions, and Use of Psychedelics among Individuals with Fibromyalgia.^\nFibromyalgia (FM) is a difficult to treat chronic pain condition for which there is strong interest in alternative treatments. There is growing interest in the potential of psychedelic substances (e.g., psilocybin) in conjunction with psychotherapy to treat chronic pain. Via a cross-sectional, anonymous, online survey, we aimed to characterize knowledge, perceptions, and past use of serotonergic (""classic"") and non-serotonergic psychedelics among a population of individuals with FM, and to investigate interest in psychedelic-based FM treatments. Among a North American population of 354 participants with FM, 29.9% reported past use of a psychedelic, with lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and psilocybin mushrooms being most commonly used. Perceptions of benefit from psychedelic use were generally neutral (59.4%) or positive (36.8%), with <3% reporting negative impacts on overall health or pain symptoms. Among 12 participants who used psychedelics with intentions of treating chronic pain, 11 reported improved symptoms. Regardless of past use, the majority of participants believed that psychedelics have potential for chronic pain treatments and would be willing to participate in a psychedelic-based clinical trial for their pain. These findings support the need for additional studies to understand the potential and effectiveness of psychedelic substances in managing FM symptoms."
"4752","0","Clinical evaluation of hemodynamic, analgesic, psychedelic and neuromuscular block effects of racemic ketamine versus S(+) ketamine.^\nBackground and Objectives - The literature suggests that S(+) ketamine is more potent and has less psychedelic effects as compared to its racemic formulation. This study aimed at comparing psychedelic, hemodynamic, analgesic and anesthetic effects of racemic ketamine versus S(+) ketamine. Methods - Participated in this study 36 adult patients premedicated with midazolam. Fentanyl was administered in the operating room (3 μg.kg-1) followed by a 2 mg.kg-1 bolus of racemic ketamine and continuous infusion (2 mg.kg-1.h-1) for Group Keta-R. Group (+) Keta received a bolus administration of 1 mg.kg-1 racemic ketamine followed by continuous infusion (1 mg.kg-1.h-1). Intravenous atracurium (0.25 mg.kg-1) was administered after loss of eyelid reflex being then increased to 0.5 mg.kg-1 for tracheal intubation. Propofol or inhalational anesthetics were used at the sole judgment of the anesthesiologist. Neuromuscular block, inhalational anesthetics consumption, perioperative analgesia, psychedelic effects including dreams and nightmares, visual and concentration alterations were evaluated by an independent observer. Results - Group (+) Keta required more propofol during anesthesia induction. Mean inhalational anesthetics consumption was higher for Group (+) Keta. Group (+) Keta was more sensitive to needle prickling and took longer to ask for analgesics as compared to Group Keta-R. Seven Group Keta-R patients and 1 Group (+) Keta patient presented with visual alterations. Group (+) Keta patients had better concentration (p=0,0033) and a lower incidence of dreams. Conclusions - S(+) ketamine provided for a better analgesia without psychedelic effects as compared to racemic ketamine."
"5513","1","The effectiveness of repeated intravenous ketamine on depressive symptoms, suicidal ideation and functional disability in adults with major depressive disorder and bipolar disorder: Results from the Canadian Rapid Treatment Center of Excellence.^\nBACKGROUND: The effectiveness, tolerability, and safety of intravenous (IV) ketamine in adults with treatment resistant depression (TRD) receiving care in real-word settings is insufficiently characterized. Herein, results from a naturalistic, retrospective study are presented from a Canadian outpatient IV ketamine clinic. METHODS: Adults (N = 213; M(age) = 45) with Major Depressive Disorder or Bipolar Disorder, with a minimum of Stage 2 antidepressant resistance, received IV ketamine at a community-based multi-disciplinary clinic. The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to post-infusion 4 on the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report-16 (QIDS-SR(16); n = 190). Secondary measures included QIDS-SR(16)-measured response and remission rates, changes from baseline to endpoint in Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7 Scale (GAD-7; n = 188) and the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS; n = 168). RESULTS: Significant improvement in total depressive symptoms severity (p < 0.0001) was observed after four infusions of IV ketamine 0.5-0.75 mg/kg. Moreover, the response rate (QIDS-SR(16) total score change ≥ 50%) was 27% and remission (QIDS-SR(16) total score ≤5) rate was 13%. Patients receiving IV ketamine exhibited anxiolytic effects (p < 0.0001,), improved overall psychosocial function (p < 0.0001), and reduced suicidal ideation (p < 0.0001). Compared to the baseline infusion, dissociation severity significantly reduced in subsequent infusions. LIMITATIONS: This was a naturalistic, retrospective study, without a control group. CONCLUSIONS: IV ketamine was safe, well-tolerated, and effective at improving depressive, anxiety, and functional impairment symptoms in a well-characterized cohort of adults with TRD."

Posttraumatic stress disorder (PtsD) is a serious condition where one of the main manifestations is emotional dysregulation related to the inability to process a traumatic event. thus, it is no coincidence that MDMa-assisted psychotherapy has become the subject of clinical trials for the treatment of PtsD in the last ten years. the results of the studies suggest that it could be a safe and effective way to treat trauma."
"8796","0","The Therapeutic Potential of Psilocybin in Alcohol Use Disorder Recovery: A Literature Review.^\nIntroduction: Psilocybin (the active compound found in “magic mushrooms”) has been an area of recent focus in the academic and psychiatric community on account of its potential in treating a spectrum of substance use and concurrent disorders (SUCDs). This paper posits a literature review of the current research pertaining to psilocybin in treating alcohol use disorder (AUD) through a form of therapy known as psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy (PAP). Methods: To undertake this study, we performed a literature review of peer-reviewed studies examining the efficacy of psilocybin in treating AUD through PAP. Inclusion criteria for papers included papers published from 2010-present, peer-reviewed sources, and clinical studies and controlled experiments observing AUD in PAP settings. Exclusion criteria used in screening papers included those focusing on other psychedelic compounds and experiments examining psilocybin efficacy in non-PAP settings. Results: Our overview of the extant literature has determined that psilocybin has strong therapeutic potential for use in PAP settings to treat AUD. Furthermore, we have identified three principal pathways through which psilocybin can elicit promising effects: neurobiological alterations (e.g., neuroplastic effects), behavioral and psychological improvements (e.g., increased receptivity towards cognitive therapies), and spiritual development (e.g., spiritual encounters improving abstinence). Discussion: The use of psilocybin in the clinical context of AUD treatment is well supported in the field of psychedelic research. Behavioural therapies are of high importance when engaging in use of psilocybin for treating AUD patients. There are certain limitations to the applications of PAP, such as predisposition to certain mental illnesses, however, the future of psilocybin therapy is expansive, ranging from subsequent animal testing to microdosing experiments. Conclusion: While our literature review bears positive findings, we encourage further research and clinical trials to be conducted to establish a larger body of evidence towards supporting or rejecting the validity of PAP. Should future research validate the efficacy of PAP for AUD treatment, therapists and psychiatrists could have another tool in their treatment reserve to assist people with SUCDs. © Kaden L.

"8253","0","Bridging the gap between the immune and glutamate hypotheses of schizophrenia and major depression: Potential role of glial NMDA receptor modulators and impaired blood-brain barrier integrity.^\nObjectives. Previous studies have suggested that the pathogenesis of schizophrenia and major depression involves an altered peripheral immune system. It is not clear, however, whether such changes are associated with corresponding neuroinflammatory responses and disturbances of neurotransmission. Methods. This paper reviews the current state of knowledge about the involvement of immune alterations in schizophrenia and major depression and a possible link to disturbances of glutamatergic transmission. Results. Inflammatory endogenous modulators of the NMDA receptor, the kynurenine pathway metabolites, are potential candidates for such a link. Studies of the blood and cerebrospinal fluid have suggested a schizophrenia-related upregulation of the NMDA receptor antagonist kynurenic acid in astrocytes, analogous to the ketamine psychosis model. Conversely, it has been proposed that there is depression-related microglial synthesis of the NMDA receptor agonist quinolinic acid, which is consistent with the observation that ketamine has therapeutic effects in major depression. Few publications have studied NMDA receptor modulating kynurenines in the brain, however. Conclusions. Future research on the cerebral cell-type specific distribution of kynurenine metabolites and their brain-regional concentration imbalances will be required to connect peripheral immune changes, the hypotheses of blood-brain barrier dysfunction and glial pathology with concepts of altered neurotransmission in schizophrenia and major depression."
"3549","0","Depression, Mindfulness, and Psilocybin: Possible Complementary Effects of Mindfulness Meditation and Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression. A Review.^\nDepression is a major public health problem that affects approximately 4.4% of the global population. Since conventional pharmacotherapies and psychotherapies are only partially effective, as demonstrated by the number of patients failing to achieve remission, alternative treatments are needed. Mindfulness meditation (MM) and psilocybin represent two promising novel treatments that might even have complementary therapeutic effects when combined. Since the current literature is limited to theoretical and empirical underpinnings of either treatment alone, the present review aimed to identify possible complementary effects that may be relevant to the treatment of depression. To that end, the individual effects of MM and psilocybin, and their underlying working mechanisms, were compared on a non-exhaustive selection of six prominent psychological and biological processes that are well known to show impairments in patients suffering from major depression disorder, that is mood, executive functioning, social skills, neuroplasticity, core neural networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmunological levels. Based on predefined search strings used in two online databases (PubMed and Google Scholar) 1129 articles were identified. After screening title and abstract for relevance related to the question, 82 articles were retained and 11 were added after reference list search, resulting in 93 articles included in the review. Findings show that MM and psilocybin exert similar effects on mood, social skills, and neuroplasticity; different effects were found on executive functioning, neural core networks, and neuroendocrine and neuroimmune system markers. Potential mechanisms of MM's effects are enhanced affective self-regulation through mental strategies, optimization of stress reactivity, and structural and functional adjustments of prefrontal and limbic areas; psilocybin's effects might be established via attenuation of cognitive associations through deep personal insights, cognitive disinhibition, and global neural network disintegration. It is suggested that, when used in combination, MM and psilocybin could exert complementary effects by potentiating or prolonging mutual positive effects, for example, MM potentially facilitating psilocybin-induced peak experiences. Future placebo-controlled double-blind randomized trials focusing on psilocybin-assisted mindfulness-based therapy will provide knowledge about whether the proposed combination of therapies maximizes their efficacy in the treatment of depression or depressive symptomatology."

In two of the five patients improvement was striking and in the other three, pain and analgesic use were reduced moderately. LSD treatment was ineffective in two patients. Intravenous infusion or bolus injection of LSD-25, 10 ng/ml at 0.5 ml/min. resulted in facilitation of 5-HT venospasm. The findings suggest that LSD-25 facilitation of 5-HT activity occurs centrally consistent with the hypothesis of the central nature of phantom limb pain."
"3913","1","Blood transcriptional response to treatment-resistant depression during electroconvulsive therapy.^\nSelective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are currently the first-line antidepressant drug treatment for major depressive disorder (MDD). Treatment-resistant depression (TRD), defined as failure to achieve remission despite adequate treatment, affects ~30% of persons with MDD. The current recommended treatment for TRD is electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), while ketamine is an experimentally suggested treatment. This study aimed to elucidate the transcriptional differences in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) between individuals with TRD and a control group without a psychiatric illness; and between patients with TRD, treated with either standard antidepressant drugs alone, or in combination with ECT or ketamine. Additionally, PBMC transcriptomics were compared between treatment responders, following completion of their treatment protocols. Total RNA was extracted from PBMC of the TRD group at two time points, and RNA and miRNA expression were profiled. Multiple mRNAs and miRNAs were found to be modified, with two protein coding genes, FKBP5 and ITGA2B, which are up- and downregulated, respectively; and several miRNAs have shown changes following successful ECT treatment. Further analysis demonstrated the direct functional regulation of ITGA2B by miR-24-3p. Our findings suggest that PBMC expression levels of FKBP5, ITGA2B, and miR-24-3p should be further explored as tentative ECT response biomarkers."
"558","1","Improvement in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion: relationship to reductions in depression and anxiety.^\nOBJECTIVE: Suicide is a psychiatric emergency. Currently, there are no approved pharmacologic treatments for suicidal ideation. Ketamine is an N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist that rapidly reduces suicidal ideation as well as depression and anxiety, but the dynamic between these symptoms is not known. The aim of this analysis was to evaluate whether ketamine has an impact on suicidal thoughts, independent of depressive and anxiety symptoms. METHODS: 133 patients with treatment-resistant depression (major depressive disorder or bipolar I/II disorder) received a single subanesthetic infusion of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg over 40 min). Post-hoc correlations and linear mixed models evaluated the relationship between suicidal ideation and depression and anxiety symptoms using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAMD), Scale for Suicidal Ideation (SSI), Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), and Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAMA) focusing on 230 min post-infusion. RESULTS: At 230 min post-infusion, correlations between changes in suicidal ideation and depression ranged from 0.23 to 0.44 (p < .05), accounting for up to 19% in the variance of ideation change. Correlations with anxiety ranged from 0.23 to 0.40 (p < .05), accounting for similar levels of variance. Ketamine infusion was associated with significant reductions in suicidal ideation compared to placebo, when controlling for the effects of ketamine on depression (F1,587 = 10.31, p = .001) and anxiety (F1,567 = 8.54, p = .004). CONCLUSIONS: Improvements in suicidal ideation after ketamine infusion are related to, but not completely driven by, improvements in depression and anxiety. Investigation of the specific effects of ketamine on suicidal thoughts is warranted."

The results of clinical studies addressing MDMA's serotonin neurotoxic potential in humans have been inconclusive. In the present study, 23 abstinent MDMA users and 19 non-MDMA controls underwent quantitative positron emission tomography (PET) studies using [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, first- and second-generation serotonin transporter (SERT) ligands previously validated in baboons for detecting MDMA-induced brain serotonin neurotoxicity. Global and regional distribution volumes (DVs) and two additional SERT-binding parameters (DV(spec) and DVR) were compared in the two subject populations using parametric statistical analyses. Data from PET studies revealed excellent correlations between the various binding parameters of [11C]McN5652 and [11C]DASB, both in individual brain regions and individual subjects. Global SERT reductions were found in MDMA users with both PET ligands, using all three of the above-mentioned SERT-binding parameters. Preplanned comparisons in 15 regions of interest demonstrated reductions in selected cortical and subcortical structures. Exploratory correlational analyses suggested that SERT measures recover with time, and that loss of the SERT is directly associated with MDMA use intensity. These quantitative PET data, obtained using validated first- and second-generation SERT PET ligands, provide strong evidence of reduced SERT density in some recreational MDMA users."
"5946","1","Evaluation of the neuroprotective effects of S(+)-ketamine during open-heart surgery.^\nWe compared the effect of S(+)-ketamine to remifentanil, both in combination with propofol, on the neurocognitive outcome after open-heart surgery in 106 patients. A battery of neurocognitive tests was administered before surgery and 1 and 10 wk after surgery. Fourteen patients (25%) in the control group and 10 patients (20%) in the S(+)-ketamine group had 2 or more tests with a cognitive deficit (decline by at least one preoperative SD of that test in all patients) 10 wk after surgery (P = 0.54). Z-scores were calculated for all tests. No significantly better performance could be detected in the S(+)-ketamine group, except for the Trailmaking B test 10 wk after surgery. We conclude that S(+)-ketamine offers no greater neuroprotection compared with remifentanil during open-heart surgery. IMPLICATIONS: N-methyl-D-aspartic acid receptors play an important role during ischemic brain injury. We could not demonstrate that S(+)-ketamine resulted in greater neuroprotective effects compared with remifentanil during cardiopulmonary bypass procedures when both were combined with propofol."
"7399","1","The effect of repeated doses of intravenous ketamine on measures of workplace attendance and productivity in adults with major depressive and bipolar disorder: Results from the canadian rapid treatment center of excellence.^\nNumerous clinical trials have reported that intravenous (IV) ketamine demonstrates rapid antidepressant and anti-suicidal effects in patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). These studies, however, have not characterized whether these antidepressant effects translate to improvements in workplace productivity and functionality. Adults with TRD received repeated doses of IV ketamine at a community-based clinic (n = 171). We evaluated patient outcomes at two timepoints of interest: (1) acute-phase (i.e., following 4-6 infusions, 17.6 ± 12.6 days from baseline) and (2) maintenance-phase (i.e., following 7-10 infusions, 153.9 ± 63.4 days from baseline). The primary outcome measure was change from baseline to maintenance-phase scores on the Sheehan Disability Scale (SDS) workplace/school item as well as days underproductive (i.e., presenteeism) and days lost (i.e., absenteeism). Secondary measures included the Quick Inventory for Depression Symptomatology-Self Report 16-Item (QIDS-SR(16)). There was a significant reduction in workplace/school disability, and significantly reduced symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism. At the acute-phase outcome, this translated to 2 more days of productivity and 1.5 less days absent from work. Additionally, IV ketamine exhibited a sustained antidepressant effect across the ten infusions. IV ketamine was associated with a significant reduction in workplace/school disability and demonstrated improvements in symptoms of presenteeism and absenteeism."
"4009","0","The Role of Ketamine in the Treatment of Bipolar Depression: A Scoping Review.^\nBipolar depression remains a clinical challenge with a quarter of patients failing to respond to initial conventional treatments. Although ketamine has been extensively studied in unipolar depression, its role in bipolar disorder remains inconclusive. The aim of our scoping review was to comprehensively synthesize the current clinical literature around ketamine use in bipolar depression. A total of 10 clinical studies (5 randomized controlled trials and 5 open label studies) were selected. The preliminary evidence, albeit weak, suggests that ketamine is a promising treatment and calls for further interest from the research community. Overall, ketamine treatment appeared to be tolerable with minimal risk for manic/hypomanic switching and showed some effectiveness across parameters of depression and suicidality. Moreover, ketamine is a potential treatment agent in patients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression with promising data extracted from extant controlled trials and real-world effectiveness studies. Future studies are needed to identify ketamine's role in acute and maintenance treatment phases of bipolar depression. Moreover, future researchers should study the recurrence prevention and anti-suicidal effects of ketamine in the treatment of bipolar depression."
"6499","0","Relationship between physical findings and related subjective symptoms in neuropsychiatric patients with somatic complications. With special reference to ophthalmologic observations.^\nThe relationship between physical signs and subjective symptoms was examined on ophthalmological abnormalities in 306 neuropsychiatric inpatients, mainly in schizophrenics. The average duration of disease was 11.3 yr and chronic cases were prominent. Control cases were 89 patients with pulmonary tuberculosis. Spontaneous complaints of the eye were made in 4 of the 306 cases. At ophthalmological examination a variety of abnormal findings were revealed in 268 cases (87.6%). This fact proved that neuropsychiatric patients complained rarely as compared with the rate of abnormal findings. As a result of clinical interview using a definite questionnaire, subjective symptoms were found in 154 (50.3%), being significantly lower than 69 (77.5%) in tuberculosis patients (p<0.05). Accordance between subjective symptoms and abnormal findings was found more often in cases of tuberculosis than in cases of neuropsychiatric patients (p<0.005). Among cases showing discordance, absence of subjective symptoms in spite of presence of abnormal findings, was observed more frequently in neuropsychiatric patients (p<0.005), especially in schizophrenics with highly advanced emotional disorder. Abnormal findings which were apt to be accompanied with no subjective symptoms were disorders of visual acuity, and opacities of the cornea and the lens. Existence of subjective symptoms without any abnormal findings was more remarkable in the tuberculosis patients (p<0.005) than in the neuropsychiatric patients. In the study of the relation between absence of subjective symptoms and administered psychotropic drugs, the amount of drugs administered during the day of ophthalmological examination, the period from the beginning of therapy to the examination (whole administration period), the total amount of psychotropic drugs and others were calculated. Cases having no subjective symptoms in spite of presence of abnormal findings presented higher levels of drug dosage and also longer periods in the whole term than cases having subjective symptoms corresponding to abnormal findings, but there was no significant difference. Comments were made on the results described above, emphasizing the importance of objective physical examinations during the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders."
"5990","1","Classic Psychedelic Coadministration with Lithium, but Not Lamotrigine, is Associated with Seizures: An Analysis of Online Psychedelic Experience Reports.^\nIntroduction Psychedelics show promise in treating unipolar depression, though patients with bipolar disorder have been excluded from recent psychedelic trials. There is limited information on the use of classic psychedelics (e.g., LSD or psilocybin) in individuals using mood stabilizers to treat bipolar disorder. This is important to know, as individuals with bipolar depression may attempt to treat themselves with psychedelics while on a mood stabilizer, particularly given enthusiastic media reports of the efficacy of psilocybin for depression. Methods This study analyzed reports of classic psychedelics administered with mood stabilizers from 3 websites (Erowid.org, Shroomery.org, and Reddit.com). Results Strikingly, 47% of 62 lithium plus psychedelic reports involved seizures, and an additional 18% resulted in bad trips while none of 34 lamotrigine reports did. Further, 39% of lithium reports involved medical attention. Most of the lamotrigine reports (65%) but few (8%) of the lithium reports were judged to not affect the psychedelic experience. Discussion Although further research is needed, we provisionally conclude that psychedelic use may pose a significant seizure risk for patients on lithium."
"8803","0","Combining ecstasy and ethanol: higher risk for toxicity? A review.^\nEcstasy use is commonly combined with ethanol consumption. While combination drug use in general is correlated with a higher risk for toxicity, the risk of the specific combination of ecstasy (3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)) and ethanol is largely unknown. Therefore, we have reviewed the literature on changes in MDMA pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics due to concurrent ethanol exposure in human, animal and in vitro studies. MDMA pharmacokinetics appear unaffected: the MDMA blood concentration after concurrent exposure to MDMA and ethanol was comparable to lone MDMA exposure in multiple human placebo-controlled studies. In contrast, MDMA pharmacodynamics were affected: locomotor activity increased and body temperature decreased after concurrent exposure to MDMA and ethanol compared to lone MDMA exposure. Importantly, these additional ethanol effects were consistently observed in multiple animal studies. Additional ethanol effects have also been reported on other pharmacodynamic aspects, but are inconclusive due to a low number of studies or due to inconsistent findings. These investigated pharmacodynamic aspects include monoamine brain concentrations, neurological (psychomotor function, memory, anxiety, reinforcing properties), cardiovascular, liver and endocrine effects. Although only a single or a few studies were available investigating these aspects, most studies indicated an aggravation of MDMA-induced effects upon concurrent ethanol exposure. In summary, concurrent ethanol exposure appears to increase the risk for MDMA toxicity. Increased toxicity is due to an aggravation of MDMA pharmacodynamics, while MDMA pharmacokinetics is largely unaffected. Although a significant attenuation of the MDMA-induced increase of body temperature was observed in animal studies, its relevance for human exposure remains unclear."
"4605","0","The psychopharmacologic and prolactin response after large doses of naloxone in man.^\nLarge doses of naloxone (150–300 mg), placebo, and morphine (15–30 mg) were given im to 14 male drug abusers (aged 21–35 yrs) and compared, using measures of subjective feeling states, physiological measures, and discriminative features. Plasma prolactin responses after naloxone 210 mg and placebo were compared. The subjective measures and discriminative features of naloxone reveal that the drug is subtly psychoactive but the stimulus is vague and cannot be identified clearly as an opioid agonist or antagonist in nondependent opioid-using volunteers. The physiologic and prolactin responses closely resembled opiate agonist activity. It is concluded that naloxone in this dose range may act as an opiate agonist in humans.

"7279","1","Effects of ecstasy (MDMA) on the brain in abstinent users: Initial observations with diffusion and perfusion MR imaging.^\nPURPOSE: To evaluate the effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) on the human brain by using diffusion and perfusion magnetic resonance (MR) imaging. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Eight abstinent ecstasy users and six ecstasy nonusers underwent diffusion and perfusion MR imaging. Apparent diffusion coefficient and relative cerebral volume maps were reconstructed. Differences in apparent diffusion coefficient values and relative cerebral volume ratios between the groups were analyzed with the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon test. The relationship between apparent diffusion coefficient and relative cerebral volume and the extent of previous ecstasy use was investigated with Spearman rank correlation. RESULTS: Apparent diffusion coefficient values (0.84 vs 0.65 × 10-5 cm2/sec, P < .025) and relative cerebral volume ratios (1.22 vs 1.01, P < .025) were significantly higher in the globus pallidus of ecstasy users compared with nonusers, respectively. Increases in pallidal relative cerebral volume were positively correlated with the extent of previous use of ecstasy (p = 0.73, P < .04). CONCLUSION: Ecstasy use is associated with tissue changes in the globus pallidus. These findings are in agreement with findings in case reports, suggesting that the globus pallidus is particularly sensitive to the effects of ecstasy."
"8809","1","Acute, sub-acute and long-term subjective consequences of 'ecstasy' (MDMA) consumption in 430 regular users.^\nThis study examined the reported psychological effects of different patterns of MDMA use in men and women, and how they are modified by use of other psychoactive substances. A semi-structured interview was conducted with 466 regular MDMA users, exploring the perceived acute, sub-acute and long-term subjective effects of this drug. Factor analysis established three main categories of acute effects of MDMA: (i) positive and (ii) negative effects on mental health, and (iii) physical effects. In terms of subacute effects, 83% of participants reported experiencing low mood and 80% reported impaired concentration between ecstasy-taking sessions. Factors affecting these effects included age, gender, extent of MDMA use and concomitant use of cocaine or amphetamine. The long-term effects most frequently reported included the development of tolerance to MDMA (59%), impaired ability to concentrate (38%), depression (37%) and 'feeling more open towards people' (31%). In terms of what might persuade users to stop using MDMA, their most prominent concern was the drug's longterm effects on mental health. Copyright © 2003 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd."
"8341","0","Could we use a serum level of glycine as a prognostic factor of its efficacy in schizophrenic patients?.^\nGlutamatergic system the main excitatory brain system is involved in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia. The ionotropic glutamatergic NMDA receptor participates in mechanisms of controlling neurotransmitter systems such as the dopaminergic, noradrenergic, serotoninergic ones and plays an important role in cognitive functioning. Glycine is a natural coagonist of the NMDA receptor and according to the hypoNMDA hypothesis treatment with its high doses (max. 60g orally per day) can improve symptomatology of schizophrenia e.g. negative symptoms and cognitive functions. Aim. If there is a correlation between plasma levels (before and after using glycine) and severity of symptoms (at the first and last assessment), then low baseline plasma concentrations could be an indication for choosing glycine in treatment, moreover a useful prognosing tool and finally a support of glutamatergic hypothesis of schizophrenia. Methods. 28 patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia according to ICD-10 diagnostic criteria (Table 1) in stable clinical condition and antipsychotic medication (typical and atypical agents) for min. 3 months, had completed a 6 week, prospective and open label study (32 patients enrolled). Between 2 visits patients received glycine in high oral doses (0.8 g/kg/day). Before and afterwards the glycine treatment, psychiatric and cognitive function examination was performed based on PANSS, Trail making test (TMT), Stroop test and Wisconsin card sorting test (WCST). In parallel glycine plasma levels were assessed. Results. There was a significant reduction in positive, negative, general psychopathology and total PANSS score during the study (Table 2). Also cognitive parameters significantly improved during 6 weeks of glycine use. Serum levels of glycine were markedly higher at the end of our project, but only improvement in part 2 of TMT correlates with changes in aminoacid serum concentrations (p=0.02). Conclusions. Our results suggest that augmentation of antipsychotic treatment (typical and atypical neuroleptics) with glycine can have a positive influence on schizophrenic symptoms there in cognitive dysfunction, but glycine plasma levels were not a useful predictor of recovery in our patients. Correlation between improvement in performance of TMT and serum level increase suggests that glycine and NMDA receptor can be involved in psychopathology of schizophrenia and cognitive functioning e.g. working memory"
"9172","0","Leveraging Neuroplasticity to Enhance Adaptive Learning: The Potential for Synergistic Somatic-Behavioral Treatment Combinations to Improve Clinical Outcomes in Depression.^\nUntil recently, therapeutic development in psychiatry was targeted solely toward symptom reduction. While this is a worthwhile goal, it has yielded little progress in improved therapeutics in the last several decades in the field of mood disorders. Recent advancements in our understanding of pathophysiology suggests that an impairment of neuroplasticity may be a critical part of the development of neuropsychiatric disorders. Interventions that enhance or modulate neuroplasticity often reduce depressive symptoms when applied as stand-alone treatments. Unfortunately, when treatments are discontinued, the disease state often returns as patients relapse. However, treatments that enhance or modulate plasticity not only reduce symptom burden, but also may provide an opportune window wherein cognitive or behavioral interventions could be introduced to harness a state of enhanced neuroplasticity and lead to improved longer-term clinical outcomes. Here, we review the potential of synergistically combining plasticity-enhancing and behavioral therapies to develop novel translational treatment approaches for depression. After reviewing relevant neuroplasticity deficits in depression, we survey biological treatments that appear to reverse such deficits in humans, including N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor modulators (ketamine, D-cycloserine), electroconvulsive therapy, and transcranial brain stimulation. We then review evidence that either directly or indirectly supports the hypothesis that a robust enhancement of neuroplasticity through these methods might promote the uptake of cognitive and behavioral interventions to enhance longer-term treatment outcomes through a synergistic effect. We identify key missing pieces of evidence and discuss future directions to enhance this emerging line of research."
"3100","1","Psychological effects of (S)-ketamine and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT): a double-blind, cross-over study in healthy volunteers.^\nINTRODUCTION: Pharmacological challenges with hallucinogens are used as models for psychosis in experimental research. The state induced by glutamate antagonists such as phencyclidine (PCP) is often considered as a more appropriate model of psychosis than the state induced by serotonergic hallucinogens such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), psilocybin and N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT). However, so far, the psychological profiles of the two types of hallucinogenic drugs have never been studied directly in an experimental within-subject design. METHODS: Fifteen healthy volunteers were included in a double-blind, cross-over study with two doses of the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist DMT and the glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist (S)-ketamine. RESULTS: Data are reported for nine subjects who completed both experimental days with both doses of the two drugs. The intensity of global psychological effects was similar for DMT and (S)-ketamine. However, phenomena resembling positive symptoms of schizophrenia, particularly positive formal thought disorder and inappropriate affect, were stronger after DMT. Phenomena resembling negative symptoms of schizophrenia, attention deficits, body perception disturbances and catatonia-like motor phenomena were stronger after (S)-ketamine. DISCUSSION: The present study suggests that the NMDA antagonist model of psychosis is not overall superior to the serotonin 5-HT2A agonist model. Rather, the two classes of drugs tend to model different aspects or types of schizophrenia. The NMDA antagonist state may be an appropriate model for psychoses with prominent negative and possibly also catatonic features, while the 5-HT2A agonist state may be a better model for psychoses of the paranoid type."
"1769","0","Preliminary evidence of cannabinoid effects on brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels in humans.^\nBACKGROUND: Acute and chronic exposure to cannabinoids has been associated with cognitive deficits, a higher risk for schizophrenia and other drug abuse. However, the precise mechanism underlying such effects is not known. Preclinical studies suggest that cannabinoids modulate brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Accordingly, we hypothesized that Delta(9)-tetrahydrocannabinol (Delta(9)-THC), the principal active component of cannabis, would alter BDNF levels in humans. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Healthy control subjects (n = 14) and light users of cannabis (n = 9) received intravenous administration of (0.0286 mg/kg) Delta(9)-THC in a double-blind, fixed order, placebo-controlled, laboratory study. Serum sampled at baseline, after placebo administration, and after Delta(9)-THC administration was assayed for BDNF using ELISA. RESULTS: Delta(9)-THC increased serum BDNF levels in healthy controls but not light users of cannabis. Further, light users of cannabis had lower basal BDNF levels. Delta(9)-THC produced psychotomimetic effects, perceptual alterations, and ""high"" and spatial memory impairments. IMPLICATIONS: The effects of socially relevant doses of cannabinoids on BDNF suggest a possible mechanism underlying the consequences of exposure to cannabis. This may be of particular importance for the developing brain and also in disorders believed to involve altered neurodevelopment such as schizophrenia. Larger studies to investigate the effects of cannabinoids on BDNF and other neurotrophins are warranted."
"7646","0","Stimulant use disorders in people with psychosis: a meta-analysis of rate and factors affecting variation.^\nOBJECTIVE: Stimulant abuse and dependence often complicate the care of people with psychotic disorders. This study systematically reviews the prevalence estimates reported for stimulant abuse and dependence in people with psychotic disorders, and examines personal, clinical, regional and methodological factors which explain variation in these rates. METHODS: PsychINFO, EMBASE and MEDLINE (1946-2013) were searched systematically for studies reporting on stimulant drug use disorders in representative samples of people with psychotic disorders. Random effects models estimated the pooled rate of a stimulant use disorder, defined to include stimulant abuse and stimulant dependence. Study characteristics associated with heterogeneity in rates of stimulant use disorder were examined by subgroup analyses for categorical variables, by meta-regression for continuous independent variables and by multiple meta-regression. RESULTS: Sixty-four studies provided 68 estimates of lifetime or recent stimulant use disorders in 22,500 people with psychosis. The pooled rate of stimulant use disorder was 8.9% (95% CI 7.4%, 10.5%). Higher rates of stimulant use disorders were reported in studies of affective psychosis, studies from inpatient settings, studies from the USA and Australia, and studies with higher rates of cannabis disorder; in multiple meta-regression analysis these factors explained 68% of between-study variance. Rates of stimulant use disorder were stable over time, and unrelated to age, sex, stage of psychosis, type of stimulant drug or study methodology factors. CONCLUSIONS: Reported rates of stimulant use disorder in people with psychosis are much higher than in the general population but vary widely and are associated with regional, service setting and clinical differences between studies. It is likely that stimulants contribute to the overall burden of psychosis, and that social and environmental factors combine with drug and illness-related factors to influence stimulant use in psychosis."
"2185","0","Rapid-onset antidepressant action of ketamine: potential revolution in understanding and future pharmacologic treatment of depression.^\nWHAT IS KNOWN AND OBJECTIVE: The current pharmacotherapeutic treatment of major depressive disorder (MDD) generally takes weeks to be effective. As the molecular action of these drugs is immediate, the mechanistic basis for this lag is unclear. A drug that has a more rapid onset of action would be a major therapeutic advance and also be a useful comparator to provide valuable mechanistic insight into the disorder and its treatment. COMMENT: Recent evidence suggests that ketamine produces rapid-onset antidepressant action. Important questions are as follows: is it specific or coincidental to other effects; is there a dose-response relationship; and is the mechanism related to that of current antidepressants. NMDA receptor antagonism is unlikely the explanation for ketamine's antidepressant action. WHAT IS NEW AND CONCLUSION: It is not an exaggeration to state that the new findings, if validated, might produce a revolution in understanding and treating depressive disorders."
"1777","0","Acute effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: The incidence rate of major depression in adolescents reaches approximately 14%. This disorder is usually recurrent, without remission of symptoms even after pharmacological treatment, and persists throughout adult life. Since the effects of antidepressants take approximately 2 weeks to begin, new pharmacological therapies are under continuous exploration. Recent evidence suggests that psychedelics could produce rapid antidepressant effects. In this study, we evaluated the potential antidepressant effects of ayahuasca in a juvenile non-human primate model of depression. METHODS: While living with their families, juvenile marmosets (8 males; 7 females) were observed on alternate days for four weeks during a baseline phase. This was followed by 8 weeks of an induced depressive state protocol, the social isolated context (IC), in which the animals were monitored in the first and last weeks. Subsequently, five males and four females were randomly selected for treatment, first with a single administration of saline vehicle (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage), followed by a single dose of ayahuasca (1.67 mL/300 g of body weight, via gavage). Both phases lasted 1 week and the animals were monitored daily. A third week of sampling was called the tardive-pharmacological effects phase. In all phases the marmosets were assessed for behavior, fecal cortisol levels, and body weight. RESULTS: After IC, the animals presented typical hypocortisolemia, but cortisol recovered to baseline levels 24 h after an acute dose of ayahuasca; this recovery was not observed in vehicle-treated animals. Additionally, in males, ayahuasca, but not the vehicle, reduced scratching, a stereotypic behavior, and increased feeding. Ayahuasca treatment also improved body weight to baseline levels in both sexes. The ayahuasca-induced behavioral response had long-term effects (14 days). Thus, in this translational juvenile animal model of depression, ayahuasca presented beneficial effects. CONCLUSIONS: These results can contribute to the validation of ayahuasca as an antidepressant drug and encourage new studies on psychedelic drugs as a tool for treating mood disorders, including for adolescents with early-onset depression."
"7475","0","Amphetamine and methamphetamine poisonings attended in hospital emergency departments: clinical features and the usefulness of laboratory confirmation.^\nOBJECTIVES: To determine whether clinical and toxicologic findings differed between cases of amphetamine (AMP) and methamphetamine (mAMP) poisoning attended in 2 Balearic Island hospital emergency departments. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Retrospective observational study of AMP and mAMP cases with laboratory confirmation between 2013 and 2018. We compared clinical and toxicologic variables as well as clinical management between groups. RESULTS: 1) A total of 120 cases were found: 86 (71.7%) with AMP poisoning and 34 (28.3%) with mAMP poisoning. 2) Drug poisoning was confirmed by gas chromatography associated with mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in 787 urine samples found to be positive during screening. One hundred fifty-four (19.6%) were confirmed by GC-MS. Thirtyfour of them did not meet the inclusion criteria. 3) Significant differences between AMP and mAMP cases were found for age (32.3 vs 28.4 y, respectively); sex (72.1% vs 94.1% men); and Spanish nationality (64.0% vs 29.4%). Reasons for admission and clinical features also differed: the reasons were aberrant behavior (15.1% in the AMP group vs 0% in the mAMP group) and palpitations (1.2% vs 20.6%); agitation was observed in 27.9% and 8.8%, respectively. Clinical management was similar in the 2 groups. Multiple drug poisoning was detected in 76.6% patients and was more common in patients in the AMP group (82.6% vs 61.8%). The additional drugs in these cases were mainly cocaine (63.0%), cannabis (48.9%), 3,4-methylenedioxy-N-methamphetamine (MDMA) (38.0%), and alcohol (35.9%). Cannabis was detected in a significantly higher proportion in the AMP group (45.3%) than in the mAMP group (17.6%). False positives were found in 78.7% of the samples. The culprit drug was most often MDMA (71.2%). CONCLUSION: AMP poisonings were associated with age over 30 years, Spanish nationality, aberrant behavior, agitation, multiple drug findings, and the use of cannabis. Poisonings caused by mAMP abuse were associated with age under 30 years, non-Spanish nationality, palpitations, and single-drug use."
"5082","1","Neuropsychological and mood effects of ketamine in electroconvulsive therapy: a randomised controlled trial.^\nBACKGROUND: Preliminary evidence suggests that the use of ketamine during electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) may be neuroprotective against cognitive impairment and have synergistic antidepressant effects. This study tested whether the addition of ketamine reduced cognitive impairment and enhanced efficacy over a course of ECT, in a randomised, placebo-controlled, double-blind study. METHODS: Fifty-one depressed patients treated with ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT were randomised to receive either ketamine (0.5mg/kg) or placebo (saline) in addition to thiopentone during anaesthesia for ECT. Neuropsychological outcomes (measured before ECT, after six treatments, and after the final ECT treatment) and mood outcomes (measured before ECT, and weekly after every three ECT treatments) were measured by a rater blinded to treatment condition. RESULTS: Neuropsychological outcomes did not differ between groups. The ECT-ketamine group had a slightly greater improvement in depressive symptoms over the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up, though there was no overall difference in efficacy at the end of the ECT course. No psychomimetic effects were detected. LIMITATIONS: The study was conducted in a clinical setting, so not all aspects of ECT treatment were fully controlled. Thiopentone doses differed slightly between groups, in order to accommodate the addition of ketamine to the anaesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of ketamine did not decrease cognitive impairment in patients having ultrabrief pulse-width right unilateral ECT, but was safe and slightly improved efficacy in the first week of treatment and at one-week follow up.

"8215","0","Hippocampal serotonergic damage induced by MDMA (ecstasy): effects on spatial learning.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) use has been associated with a decline in various aspects of mnemonic function in humans. We therefore postulated that MDMA-induced damage of serotonergic nerve terminals would alter hippocampal processing. Seven days following treatment with MDMA (2 x 20 mg/kg sc, given 12 h apart), rat spatial learning and memory were tested utilizing the Morris water maze (MWM). No statistical differences were found in MWM platform aquisition latency or pathlength between controls and MDMA-treated animals. Probe trials revealed significantly higher proximity score averages and significantly reduced preference for the target quadrant in the MDMA-treated animals. MDMA treatment resulted in significant reduction (34%) in hippocampal serotonin (5-HT) levels 14 days after initial treatment. The findings of this study demonstrate that hippocampal serotonergic lesions induced by MDMA may be ostensibly linked to a reference memory deficit in rats tested with the MWM.

"3781","1","α₁-Adrenergic receptors contribute to the acute effects of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine in humans.^\nPreclinical studies implicate a role for α₁-noradrenergic receptors in the effects of psychostimulants, including 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""ecstasy""). The present study evaluated the effects of the α₁-noradrenergic receptor antagonist doxazosin on the acute pharmacodynamic and pharmacokinetic response to MDMA in 16 healthy subjects. Doxazosin (8 mg/d) or placebo was administered for 3 days before MDMA (125 mg) or placebo using a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, 4-session, crossover design. Doxazosin reduced MDMA-induced elevations in blood pressure, body temperature, and moderately attenuated positive mood but enhanced tachycardia associated with MDMA. The results indicate that α₁-adrenergic receptors contribute to the acute cardiostimulant and to a minor extent possibly also to the thermogenic and euphoric effects of MDMA in humans."
"8687","1","The Effects of Ketamine on Cognition in Unipolar and Bipolar Depression: A Systematic Review.^\nObjective: To determine the objective neurocognitive effects of (1) single-dose ketamine, (2) repeated-dose ketamine, (3) ketamine adjunct to electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), and (4) ketamine as the anesthetic for ECT in major depressive disorder (MDD) and depression in bipolar disorder (BD). Data Sources: Cochrane, MEDLINE, Embase, and PsycINFO databases were searched on March 19, 2020 (updated July 2, 2020), using the terms terms major depressive disorder bipolar disorder and ketamine and their synonyms. Clinical trial registries (search date May 4, 2020) and reference sections of included articles were also searched. There was no restriction on language or year of publication. Study Selection: Of 4,035 identified articles, 17 met inclusion criteria. Controlled and open-label studies of adults who received at least 1 ketamine treatment for a current major depressive episode, as part of MDD or BD, were included. Only studies measuring cognition using at least 1 validated, objective neurocognitive assessment were eligible. Data Extraction: Results are presented using a narrative review format. Data regarding change in cognitive performance from baseline to end-of-treatment and/or differences in cognition between ketamine and control groups were extracted. Results: There were no negative effects of single- or repeated-dose intravenous ketamine up to 2 weeks post-treatment in MDD. Limited data were available for BD populations, as well as on other routes of ketamine administration. Conclusions: Data to definitively answer the question of whether ketamine has substantive or persistent cognitive effects are insufficient; thus, larger controlled trials measuring cognition as the primary outcome are needed. Future research should focus on different routes of ketamine administration, ketamine enantiomers, and BD populations."
"1703","1","Neurocognitive impact of ketamine treatment in major depressive disorder: A review on human and animal studies.^\nBACKGROUND: Most recent evidence support a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of subanesthetic dose of intravenous ketamine in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). However, clinical and animal studies investigating the effects of intravenous ketamine on specific functional domains disrupted by depression reported conflicting results. Therefore, the aim of this review is to provide an overview of the recent findings exploring the cognitive effects of ketamine in depression. METHODS: After a bibliographic search on PubMed, Medline and PsycInfo, we retrieved 11 original studies meeting our research criteria, 7 in humans with MDD or Treatment Resistant Disorder and 4 using rats models for depression. RESULTS: Overall the results showed that a) ketamine reduced activation and normalized connectivity measures of several brain regions related to depressive behaviors and reversed deficits in cognitive flexibility and coping response strategy in rats with depressive features, and b) ketamine leads to a no significant impairment on neurocognitive functions in most of the studies, with only three studies observing improvements in speed of processing, verbal learning, sustained attention and response control, verbal and working memory. LIMITATIONS: The methodological heterogeneity, in terms of neuropsychological tests used and cognitive domain explored, of the studies included. CONCLUSIONS: Most of the studies included showed no significant cognitive impairments in MDD patients after ketamine treatment. Furthermore, the results of the fMRI studies considered suggest that ketamine may have a normalizing effect on brain functions during attentional and emotional processing in MDD patients. However, further studies are needed to confirm these preliminary evidences."
"1616","1","Psychosocial determinants of ecstasy use in young people in the UK.^\nObjectives. The present research aimed to examine the psychosocial determinants of ecstasy use in young people in the UK. Design. Two studies applied the theory of planned behaviour (TPB) to understanding ecstasy use. In Study 1, students completed questionnaires measuring components of the TPB. In Study 2, a random sample of members of a nightclub completed measures of attitudinal ambivalence and components of the TPB in relation to taking ecstasy in the next two months. Reported use of ecstasy was assessed two months later. Methods. Both studies employed self-completion questionnaires. In Study 1 a single questionnaire was completed by 186 students. In Study 2 a first questionnaire was completed by 203 members of a nightclub and a second questionnaire two months later by 123 respondents. Results. In Study 1, attitudes, subjective norms and perceived behavioural control accounted for 50 per cent of the variance in intentions. In Study 2, TPB components explained 63 per cent of the variance in intentions. Intentions and perceived control explained 55 per cent of the variance in subsequent ecstasy use. Attitudinal ambivalence moderated the intention-behaviour relationship such that the impact of intentions on subsequent behaviour was significantly stronger for individuals with lower levels of ambivalence. Conclusions. The TPB provided a good basis for understanding intentions and actual use of ecstasy in young people in the UK. The different beliefs of users and non-users may form a useful basis for health education."
"6584","1","Intravenous Ketamine for Late-Life Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Pilot Study of Tolerability, Safety, Clinical Benefits, and Effect on Cognition.^\nOBJECTIVE: Evidence-based treatment options for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD) are limited. Ketamine is a promising treatment for TRD; however, there is a paucity of data on its safety and efficacy in older adults. METHODS: In this pilot clinical trial, 25 adults aged ≥60 years with TRD received IV ketamine openly twice a week for 4 weeks; partial responders at the end of this acute phase were eligible to receive weekly infusions for 4 more weeks in a continuation phase. Acceptability, tolerability, and safety, including adverse and serious adverse events (AEs and SAEs), blood pressure changes, dissociation, craving, in addition to rates of depression response and remission were evaluated. The NIH Toolbox Cognitive Battery was used to assess specific measures of executive function (EF) and overall fluid cognition. RESULTS: Completion rates were 88% for the acute phase and 100% for the continuation phase. No AEs resulted in participant discontinuation, and there were no SAEs. Treatment-emergent elevation of blood pressure, dissociation, and craving were transient and did not result in any participant discontinuation. Depressive symptoms improved significantly and 48% of participants responded. During the acute phase, the EF measures and the fluid cognition composite score improved (Cohen's d = 0.61), and these improvements were sustained in the continuation phase. CONCLUSION: This pilot study suggests that repeated IV ketamine infusions are well-tolerated and are associated with improvement in depression and EF in older adults with TRD. These promising findings need to be confirmed and extended in a larger randomized controlled trial."
"9525","1","Influence of DNA methylation on the antidepressant effect of ketamine.^\nBackground: Ketamine is a high‐affinity non‐competitive NMDA (N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic, N‐methyl‐D‐aspartic) receptor antagonist. In recent years, studies have found that ketamine has rapid onset antidepressant effect. However, the use of ketamine for antidepressant treatment has the risk of causing adverse reactions such as psychiatric symptoms, addiction, and so on. The aim of this study is to find DNA methylation sites related to the efficacy of ketamine and screening‐related genes. It will be the foundation of the accurate use of ketamine for depression. Methods: This study included a randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled study of brain tumors with depression. The subjects received a small dose of ketamine intravenously (0.5mg/kg, 40 minutes) during the operation. The Montgomery‐ Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) was used to assess depression. According to the improvement of depression on the third day after operation, patients were divided into an effective group (MADRS score reduction rate is greater than or equal to 50%) and an ineffective group (MADRS score reduction rate is less than 50%). Illumina Infinium Methylation EPIC Bead Chip (850K DNA methylation chip) was used to carry out genomewide methylation of peripheral blood in two groups. The methylation sites with significant difference between the two groups (p < 0.05) were compared. According to the difference of methylation beta and the difference score, bioinformatics analysis was carried out using GO analysis and Pathway in Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes to select chloramine. Ketone therapy is associated with different DNA methylation levels. Results: A total of 34 subjects using ketamine were included in this study, of who 20 were in the ineffective group and 14 were in the effective group. A total of 34,140 differentially methylated sites were identified by 850K DNA methylation chip screening. These differentially methylated sites were located on 13,209 genes. Through bioinformatics screening, we have identified 39 genes related to multiple pathways as the basis for subsequent research. Conclusion: It was found that many metabolic and signaling pathways were involved in the factors affecting the efficacy of ketamine. Through bioinformatics analysis and literature review, 39 anti‐ketamine drugs were screened out. Genes related to the efficacy of depression lay the foundation for future research."
"9000","1","Sleep improvement is associated with the antidepressant efficacy of repeated-dose ketamine and serum BDNF levels: a post-hoc analysis.^\nRATIONALE: Recently, the effects of ketamine on the circadian rhythm have suggested that ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects are associated with and without sleep disturbance improvement. OBJECTIVES: Here, we evaluated the antidepressant efficacy of repeated ketamine infusions in patients with sleep disturbances. METHODS: This study included 127 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder who received ketamine treatments during a 12-day period. Sleep quality was assessed by the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale sleep disturbance factor (SDF) (items 4, 5 and 6). Serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) was measured at baseline, day 13 and day 26. This study was a post-hoc analysis. RESULTS: Significant differences were found in the HAMD-17 score at 13 post-infusion time points compared to baseline, as well as the scores in SDF score at each of the 7 post-infusion (4 h after each infusion excluded) time points among all patients. Logistic regression and linear correlation analyses revealed that a greater reduction in the SDF after 24 h of the first ketamine infusion resulted in a better antidepressant effect in the last two follow-up visits. Moreover, BDNF levels were significantly higher in sleep responders than in non-responders. CONCLUSIONS: In the 127 patients, six ketamine infusions induced better therapeutic effects in sleep responders than in sleep non-responders and patients without sleep disturbances. The sleep response after repeated ketamine infusions was positively associated with high serum BDNF levels. Early sleep disturbance improvement (as early as 24 h after the first ketamine injection) may predict the antidepressant effect of repeated-dose ketamine."

In 159 healthy individuals (53 females), the association between 5-HT(2A) R binding in neocortex imaged with [(18) F]altanserin or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 PET and personality trait Openness was investigated using linear regression models. In these models the influence of sex on the association was also investigated. Trait Openness was assessed with the NEO Personality Inventory-Revised. No significant associations between neocortical 5-HT(2A) R binding and trait Openness were found for [(18) F]altanserin (p = 0.5) or [(11) C]Cimbi-36 (p = 0.8). Pooling the data in a combined model did not substantially change our results (p = 0.4). No significant interactions with sex were found (p > 0.35). Our results indicate that differences in 5-HT(2A) R availability are not related to variations in trait Openness in healthy individuals. Although stimulation of the 5-HT(2A) R with compounds such as psilocybin may contribute to long-term changes in trait Openness, there is no evidence in favor of an association between 5-HT(2A) R and trait Openness."
"9249","0","Could psychedelic drugs have a role in the treatment of schizophrenia? Rationale and strategy for safe implementation.^\nSchizophrenia is a widespread psychiatric disorder that affects 0.5-1.0% of the world's population and induces significant, long-term disability that exacts high personal and societal cost. Negative symptoms, which respond poorly to available antipsychotic drugs, are the primary cause of this disability. Association of negative symptoms with cortical atrophy and cell loss is widely reported. Psychedelic drugs are undergoing a significant renaissance in psychiatric disorders with efficacy reported in several conditions including depression, in individuals facing terminal cancer, posttraumatic stress disorder, and addiction. There is considerable evidence from preclinical studies and some support from human studies that psychedelics enhance neuroplasticity. In this Perspective, we consider the possibility that psychedelic drugs could have a role in treating cortical atrophy and cell loss in schizophrenia, and ameliorating the negative symptoms associated with these pathological manifestations. The foremost concern in treating schizophrenia patients with psychedelic drugs is induction or exacerbation of psychosis. We consider several strategies that could be implemented to mitigate the danger of psychotogenic effects and allow treatment of schizophrenia patients with psychedelics to be implemented. These include use of non-hallucinogenic derivatives, which are currently the focus of intense study, implementation of sub-psychedelic or microdosing, harnessing of entourage effects in extracts of psychedelic mushrooms, and blocking 5-HT2A receptor-mediated hallucinogenic effects. Preclinical studies that employ appropriate animal models are a prerequisite and clinical studies will need to be carefully designed on the basis of preclinical and translational data. Careful research in this area could significantly impact the treatment of one of the most severe and socially debilitating psychiatric disorders and open an exciting new frontier in psychopharmacology."
"2102","1","Direct comparison of the acute subjective, emotional, autonomic, and endocrine effects of MDMA, methylphenidate, and modafinil in healthy subjects.^\nRATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects. METHODS: We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI). RESULTS: All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA induced subjective, emotional, sexual, and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used."

However, ketamine's clinical utility is limited by its acute psychotomimetic or dissociative effects. This raises the question whether it is possible to develop compounds that target the NMDA receptors without these adverse effects. Here we report on the results from a Phase IIb study to evaluate the antidepressant properties of a novel, low‐trapping NMDA channel blocker (AZD6765). The purpose of the study was to determine the effect of adjunct AZD6765 on symptom improvement in patients with major depressive disorder who had a history of inadequate response to antidepressants and had severe symptoms despite current treatment. Methods: We conducted a Phase IIb (NCT00781742), multicenter, double‐blind, randomized, placebo‐controlled, parallel group, outpatient study. Patients were randomly assigned to receive a 1 h intravenous infusion of AZD6765 at doses of 100 mg or 150 mg, or placebo (saline), 3 times per week for 3 weeks with a follow‐up to 8 weeks. The primary endpoint was change in the Montgomery Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score. Secondary endpoints included an assessment of efficacy at Day 3, response, remission, QIDS‐SR16, HAM‐A and CGI at each assessment, and safety and tolerability assessments from baseline to Week 8. Results: MADRS total score change at Week 3 was significant for AZD6765 100 mg, ‐5.5 (adjusted P=0.006) and 150mg, ‐4.8 (adjusted P=0.019) compared with placebo. During the first week of treatment, we observed a transient antidepressant effect at the end of each infusion. Although no statistically significant differences for either dose were observed at Day 3, there was a statistically significant efficacy at 2 weeks for the 100‐mg dose (Δ=‐4.2; P=0.011). Persistence of efficacy after stopping infusions was seen for several weeks, which was greater for the 100‐mg dose. There was no statistical difference between 100mg and 150 mg, but the 100 mg‐dose showed slightly greater improvements in several secondary endpoints including response rates, CGI‐I, QIDSSR16, and HAM‐A. Both doses were generally well tolerated, with the most common adverse events being mild and transient dizziness and blood pressure increases. AZD6765 did not produce psychotomimetic or dissociative effects as measured by CADSS. Conclusions: These data indicate that AZD6765, a low‐trapping NMDA channel blocker provides antidepressant effects in patients who have previously had an inadequate response to multiple antidepressants, and can do so without psychotomimetic or dissociative symptoms. Cumulative efficacy was seen over the 3‐week treatment period and persisted for several weeks after the last infusion. In summary, we demonstrate that AZD6765 was well tolerated and effective at reducing depressive symptoms and represents a promising approach for severely depressed, treatment‐resistant patients."
"7501","0","Effect of Oral Midazolam in Pain Relief of Patients Need Nasogastric Tube Insertion: A Clinical Trial Study.^\nOBJECTIVE: Due to the presence of pain during nasogastric tube (NGT) insertion and related complications and lack of positive clinical response of nasopharyngeal anesthesia with lidocaine and the related side effects and limitations in ketamine and intravenous midazolam, this study aims to determine the efficacy of oral midazolam in relieving pain in the patients requiring NGT insertion. METHODS: A randomized, triple-blind clinical trial was performed on the patients in the Emergency Department of Zanjan Valiasr and Mousavi Hospitals in Iran, who were nominated for NGT. In each group, 100 patients were examined. Two milligram syrups of midazolam and placebo were administered 20 min before the procedure. In two groups, the pain based on the Visual Analog Scale and satisfaction rate of patients during the NGT insertion were compared. The data were analyzed through the SPSS software version 16.0. FINDINGS: There was no statistically significant difference in the demographic characteristics of two groups. Despite the effects of potential confounding variables, the cause of the referral and indication of NGT, as well as the use of midazolam syrup, had a significant relationship with the outcome, so that midazolam group experienced less pain. The mean and standard deviation of the examined outcomes (feeling of pain and satisfaction with NGT insertion) was statistically significantly different in the midazolam group as compared to the placebo group (P = 0.001). CONCLUSION: Midazolam was effective in decreasing pain and increasing the satisfaction of patients after NGT insertion. This manuscript is registered in Irct. com with code IRCT20110629006922N4."
