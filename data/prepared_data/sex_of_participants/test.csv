"6137","Pilot Trial of Visual Healing® in Psilocybin-assisted Therapy for Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nThe objective of the study is to test a strategy for optimizing Set and Setting for psilocybin‐assisted therapy of alcohol use disorder. Psilocybin shows promise in early trials for alcohol use disorder, but initial results suggest that patients with alcohol use disorder may be less likely to achieve a mystical experience with standard doses of psilocybin. Optimizing Set and Setting for the psilocybin experience may improve outcomes without requiring higher drug doses. The current study will complete a pilot randomized clinical trial to assess the feasibility, safety, and tolerability of Visual Healing Set and Setting (N=10) versus standard Set and Setting procedures (N=10) in participants with alcohol use disorder undergoing open‐label psilocybin 25 mg therapy. In the Visual Healing condition, participants will view nature‐themed video programs during the Prep session and during the Ascent phase of the psilocybin experience. Anecdotal reports and reviews suggest that viewing Visual Healing creates a tranquil and calming environment that fosters a stronger connection between the viewer and nature. Psilocybin increases the users feeling of connection to nature and having an intention to connect with nature during the psychedelic session is associated with better outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy in initial studies. Reducing pre‐dosing anxiety/apprehension and enhancing connections to nature with Visual Healing may improve outcomes of psychedelic‐assisted therapy without the need for higher psilocybin doses.","4"
"1291","Neural correlates of rapid antidepressant response to ketamine in treatment-resistant unipolar depression: a preliminary positron emission tomography study.^\nBACKGROUND: Multiple lines of evidence support a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of major depressive disorder (MDD). Ketamine, an N-methyl-D-aspartate antagonist, rapidly improves depressive symptoms in individuals with treatment-resistant depression. The neural mechanisms underlying this effect remain unknown. METHODS: In this preliminary study, 20 unmedicated participants with treatment-resistant MDD underwent positron emission tomography to measure regional cerebral glucose metabolism at baseline and following ketamine infusion (single dose of .5mg/kg intravenous over 40minutes). Metabolic data were compared between conditions using a combination of region-of-interest and voxelwise analyses, and differences were correlated with the associated antidepressant response. RESULTS: Whole-brain metabolism did not change significantly following ketamine. Regional metabolism decreased significantly under ketamine in the habenula, insula, and ventrolateral and dorsolateral prefrontal cortices of the right hemisphere. Metabolism increased postketamine in bilateral occipital, right sensorimotor, left parahippocampal, and left inferior parietal cortices. Improvement in depression ratings correlated directly with change in metabolism in right superior and middle temporal gyri. Conversely, clinical improvement correlated inversely with metabolic changes in right parahippocampal gyrus and temporoparietal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: Although preliminary, these results indicate that treatment-resistant MDD subjects showed decreased metabolism in the right habenula and the extended medial and orbital prefrontal networks in association with rapid antidepressant response to ketamine. Conversely, metabolism increased in sensory association cortices, conceivably related to the illusory phenomena sometimes experienced with ketamine. Further studies are needed to elucidate how these functional anatomical changes relate to the molecular mechanisms underlying ketamine's rapid antidepressant effects.","0"
"3451","Neurocognitive performance under combined regimens of ketamine-dexmedetomidine and ketamine-fentanyl in healthy adults: A randomised trial.^\nAnalgesic doses of ketamine affects neurocognition; however, deficits under co-administration regimens are unknown. This study evaluated the effects of ketamine, alone and in combination with dexmedetomidine or fentanyl on neurocognition. Using a randomised, within-subjects gender stratified design, 39 participants (mean age = 28.4, SD ± 5.8) received a ketamine bolus of 0.3 mg/kg followed by 0.15 mg/kg/h infusion of ketamine (3 h duration). At 1.5 h post-ketamine infusion commencement, participants received either: i) 0.7 μg/kg/h infusion of dexmedetomidine (n = 19) (KET/DEX) or (ii) three 25 μg fentanyl injections over 1.5 h (n = 20) (KET/FENT). Reaction and Movement time (RTI, Simple and 5Choice), Visuospatial Working Memory (SWM) and Verbal Recognition Memory (VRM) were assessed using the Cambridge Neuropsychological Test Automated Battery (CANTAB). Whole blood drug concentrations were determined during ketamine-only infusion, at co-administration (KET/DEX or KET/FENT) and at 2-h post-treatment. Ketamine-only administration impaired psychomotor response speed (Simple and 5Choice) and impaired memory (all p < .001), however did not alter executive function abilities. Independent of sedation, co-administration of dexmedetomidine produced synergistic performance and memory deficits which persisted at post-treatment (KET/DEX) (all p < .001), and were comparatively greater than for KET/FENT (all p < .05). Ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine concentrations were modestly associated with reduced psychomotor speed and accuracy (all p < .05), and an inverse relationship was found between blood concentrations of ketamine, norketamine and dexmedetomidine and performance on memory tasks. Co-administration of ketamine with dexmedetomidine but not with fentanyl exerts synergistic effects on psychomotor performance and memory without executive dysfunction. Assessment of these effects in clinical groups is warranted. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)","0"
"9505","The Impact of Ayahuasca on Suicidality: Results From a Randomized Controlled Trial.^\nSuicide is a major public health problem. Given increasing suicide rates and limitations surrounding current interventions, there is an urgent need for innovative interventions for suicidality. Although ayahuasca has been shown to target mental health concerns associated with suicidality (i.e., depression and hopelessness), research has not yet explored the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. Therefore, we conducted secondary analyses of a randomized placebo-controlled trial in which individuals with treatment-resistant depression were administered one dose of ayahuasca (n = 14) or placebo (n = 15). Suicidality was assessed by a trained psychiatrist at baseline, as well as 1 day, 2 days, and 7 days after the intervention. A fixed-effects linear mixed model, as well as between and within-groups Cohen's d effect sizes were used to examine changes in suicidality. Controlling for baseline suicidality, we found a significant effect for time (p < .05). The effect of the intervention (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo) trended toward significance (p = .088). At all time points, we found medium between-group effect sizes (i.e., ayahuasca vs. placebo; day 1 Cohen's d = 0.58; day 2 d = 0.56; day 7 d = 0.67), as well as large within-group (ayahuasca; day 1 Cohen's d = 1.33; day 2 d = 1.42; day 7 d = 1.19) effect sizes, for decreases in suicidality. Conclusions: This research is the first to explore the impact of ayahuasca on suicidality. The findings suggest that ayahuasca may show potential as an intervention for suicidality. We highlight important limitations of the study, potential mechanisms, and future directions for research on ayahuasca as an intervention for suicidality.

"8248","Effects of ketamine on brain function during smooth pursuit eye movements.^\nThe uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonist ketamine has been proposed to model symptoms of psychosis. Smooth pursuit eye movements (SPEM) are an established biomarker of schizophrenia. SPEM performance has been shown to be impaired in the schizophrenia spectrum and during ketamine administration in healthy volunteers. However, the neural mechanisms mediating SPEM impairments during ketamine administration are unknown. In a counter-balanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-subjects design, 27 healthy participants received intravenous racemic ketamine (100 ng/mL target plasma concentration) on one of two assessment days and placebo (intravenous saline) on the other. Participants performed a block-design SPEM task during functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) at 3 Tesla field strength. Self-ratings of psychosis-like experiences were obtained using the Psychotomimetic States Inventory (PSI). Ketamine administration induced psychosis-like symptoms, during ketamine infusion, participants showed increased ratings on the PSI dimensions cognitive disorganization, delusional thinking, perceptual distortion and mania. Ketamine led to robust deficits in SPEM performance, which were accompanied by reduced blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal in the SPEM network including primary visual cortex, area V5 and the right frontal eye field (FEF), compared to placebo. A measure of connectivity with V5 and FEF as seed regions, however, was not significantly affected by ketamine. These results are similar to the deviations found in schizophrenia patients. Our findings support the role of glutamate dysfunction in impaired smooth pursuit performance and the use of ketamine as a pharmacological model of psychosis, especially when combined with oculomotor biomarkers.

"6195","Psilocybin-facilitated Treatment for Chronic Pain.^\nParticipants will be randomized to two groups: Psilocybin or Active Placebo. Those in the Psilocybin condition will receive .36 mg/kg of psilocybin. Based on previous research, .36 mg/kg of psilocybin is expected to balance the intention to increase the probability of having a full mystical‐type experience against the odds of having a subjectively challenging psychological experience. Those in the Active Placebo condition will receive 2.6 mg/kg of dextromethorphan (DXM). DXM was selected as the placebo drug in the current study because its subjective and behavioral effects at higher doses can resemble those of classical hallucinogens. Participants will be blinded to what drug they are administered. Participants will be unblinded at the end of the study. Interested individuals who call research staff will undergo an initial telephone prescreen by a trained member of the research staff: the study aims, protocol, and any possible risks will be described and a series of questions will be asked to determine interest and eligibility for screening for the study. Initial eligibility may also be assessed via an online questionnaire through Qualtrics. Qualified participants will be scheduled for an in‐person screening. In‐person screening sessions will be conducted by the PI or trained research staff. Individuals will first undergo informed consent; the consent form will describe the necessary eligibility confirmation that takes place before proceeding with the full study. A physical examination, a detailed psychiatric interview, several self‐report questionnaires, and a detailed medical history will be completed at the screening session, which takes place at the UAB Clinical Research Unit. Participants will also have their blood drawn for screening tests. Study staff will provide participants with a hand‐held tablet device and instructions on how to complete the daily symptom questionnaire via the tablet. They will be asked to begin reporting daily symptoms on their tablet from home that evening. Eligible participants will be contacted by study staff by phone to inform them of their eligibility. All participants will undergo at least 2 weekly preparation sessions of approximately 2 hours each, with the possibility of 1‐2 additional weekly preparatory sessions per the discretion of the investigator. These sessions are to educate participants on the study protocol, psilocybin administration, and study treatment rationale. Participants will be randomly assigned in a double‐blind manner to the Psilocybin or Active Placebo group following their final preparation session. One week after the final preparation session, participants will be instructed to eat a low‐fat breakfast prior to presenting for their drug administration session at 8:00 am, approximately 1 hour before drug administration. A urine sample will be collected to verify drug‐free and non‐pregnant status and participants will be encouraged to relax and reflect before drug administration. The drug administration session will take place over the course of 8 hours. The guide and secondary monitor will be present with and monitor participants throughout this session (at least one individual will always be present with the participant, even during brief intervals when the guide or monitor may be using the restroom). Participants will be monitored for physical symptoms of distress and encouraged to report any symptoms experienced. Blood pressure will be assessed pre‐administration via automatic blood pressure monitor, and may also be assessed at 30, 60, 90, 120, 180, 240, 300, and 360 minutes post‐administration. Seven hours after drug administration, when the major drug effects have subsided, participants will complete questionnaires assessing their experience. Participants will then be released into the care of a friend or family member oriented to be emotionally supportive of the participant (as arranged during preparation sessions) and instructed not to drive an automobile or engage in any other potentially dangerous activity for the remainder f the day. Participants will be provided with the guide's contact information by phone should they feel the need for support that evening. An immediate post‐session meeting will be held the day following the drug administration session. Participants will meet with the guide for approximately 2 hours to discuss and reflect on their experience. A final study visit will take place approximately 6 weeks later; some questionnaires that were administered at Visit 1 will be administered again at the final visit. At the conclusion of the final study visit, participants will be debriefed.","4"
"7318","Chronic ketamine use increases serum levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor.^\nRationale: Ketamine is a non-competitive N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist which interferes with the action of excitatory amino acids (EAAs) including glutamate and aspartate. The use of ketamine at subanaesthetic doses has increased because of its psychotomimetic properties. However, long-term ketamine abuse may interfere with memory processes and inhibit the induction of long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus, an effect probably mediated by its NMDA antagonist action. Neurotrophins such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and nerve growth factor (NGF) serve as survival factors for selected populations of central nervous system neurons, including cholinergic and dopaminergic neurons. In addition, neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, may regulate LTP in the hippocampus and influence synaptic plasticity. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that ketamine use in humans is associated with altered serum levels of neurotrophins. Methods: We measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay the NGF and BDNF serum levels in two groups of subjects: frequent ketamine users and healthy subjects. Results: Our data show that BDNF serum levels were increased in chronic ketamine users as compared to healthy subjects, while NGF levels were not affected by ketamine use. Conclusion: These findings suggest that chronic ketamine intake is associated with increases in BDNF serum levels in humans. Other studies are needed to explore the pharmacological and molecular mechanism by which ketamine, and/or other NMDA antagonists, may induce modification in the production and utilization of BDNF and alter normal brain function.

"2102","Direct comparison of the acute subjective, emotional, autonomic, and endocrine effects of MDMA, methylphenidate, and modafinil in healthy subjects.^\nRATIONALE: 3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is used recreationally and investigated as an adjunct to psychotherapy. Methylphenidate and modafinil are psychostimulants that are used to treat attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy, respectively, but they are also misused as cognitive enhancers. Little is known about differences in the acute effects of equally cardiostimulant doses of these stimulant-type substances compared directly within the same subjects. METHODS: We investigated the acute autonomic, subjective, endocrine, and emotional effects of single doses of MDMA (125 mg), methylphenidate (60 mg), modafinil (600 mg), and placebo in a double-blind, cross-over study in 24 healthy participants. Acute drug effects were tested using psychometric scales, the Facial Emotion Recognition Task (FERT), and the Sexual Arousal and Desire Inventory (SADI). RESULTS: All active drugs produced comparable hemodynamic and adverse effects. MDMA produced greater increases in pupil dilation, subjective good drug effects, drug liking, happiness, trust, well-being, and alterations in consciousness than methylphenidate or modafinil. Only MDMA reduced subjective anxiety and impaired fear recognition and led to misclassifications of emotions as happy on the FERT. On the SADI, only MDMA produced sexual arousal-like effects. Only MDMA produced marked increases in cortisol, prolactin, and oxytocin. In contrast to MDMA, methylphenidate increased subjective anxiety, and methylphenidate and modafinil increased misclassifications of emotions as angry on the FERT. Modafinil had no significant subjective drug effects but significant sympathomimetic and adverse effects. CONCLUSIONS: MDMA induced subjective, emotional, sexual, and endocrine effects that were clearly distinct from those of methylphenidate and modafinil at the doses used.","0"
"7379","Serotonergic hallucinogens and recognition of facial emotion expressions: a systematic review of the literature.^\nBACKGROUND: Recognition of emotions in facial expressions (REFE) is a key aspect of social cognition. Anxiety and mood disorders are associated with deficits in REFE, and anxiolytics and antidepressants reverse these deficits. Recent studies have shown that serotonergic hallucinogens (i.e. ayahuasca, dimethyltryptamine, psilocybin, lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD], and mescaline) have anxiolytic and antidepressant properties, but their effects on REFE are not well understood. The purpose of the study was to conduct a systematic review analyzing the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans. METHODS: Studies published in the PubMed, PsycINFO, and Web of Science databases until 19 October 2018 which analyzed the effects of serotonergic hallucinogens on REFE in humans were included. RESULTS: Of the 62 studies identified, 8 studies were included. Included studies involved the administration of a single or a few doses of LSD or psilocybin, and most trials were randomized and controlled with placebo. LSD and psilocybin reduced the recognition of negative emotions in most studies and modulated amygdala activity to these stimuli, which was correlated with antidepressive effects in patients. Both drugs were well tolerated. CONCLUSIONS: Serotonergic hallucinogens reduced the recognition of negative emotions by modulating amygdala activity. Despite the small sample sizes, results suggest that serotonergic hallucinogens show promising beneficial effects on deficits in REFE.","3"
"8105","Social Contacts and Ecstasy Offers: Findings of a Population-Based Study.^\nEcstasy (MDMA) use is relatively common among young adults in many developed countries. However, little is known about how young non-users are first introduced to Ecstasy, including the relative contribution of peer networks and individual risk factors. We assess the role of social contact with Ecstasy-using peers in regard to young adults' exposure to offers of Ecstasy, using data from the Natural History Study, a population-based study conducted in Australia. Population screening of young adults (19- to 23-year-olds) identified a sample of young Ecstasy users (N = 315) and a comparison group of Ecstasy-naïve participants (N = 199). Two outcomes are considered: being exposed to any Ecstasy offers and being exposed to > 3 offers. Extensive social contact with Ecstasy users was defined as knowing >10 Ecstasy users. Of the Ecstasy-naïve young adults, >40% had ever received Ecstasy offers. Extensive social contact with Ecstasy users independently predicted exposure to multiple (> 3) Ecstasy offers for Ecstasy-naïve young adults. These findings indicate that Ecstasy offers are widespread among users and non-users of Ecstasy. For non-users, exposure to Ecstasy offers occurs through social contact with drug-using peers independently of individual risk factors. The pervasiveness of Ecstasy offers suggests that universal education concerning Ecstasy use is required. © 2013 Taylor and Francis Group, LLC.","0"
"2482","Safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of low dose lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) in healthy older volunteers.^\nResearch has shown that psychedelics, such as lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD), have profound anti-inflammatory properties mediated by 5-HT(2A) receptor signaling, supporting their evaluation as a therapeutic for neuroinflammation associated with neurodegenerative disease. OBJECTIVE: This study evaluated the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamics of orally repeated administration of 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD in older healthy individuals. In the current paper, we present safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and pharmacodynamic measures that relate to safety, tolerability, and dose response. METHODS: This was a phase 1 double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized study. Volunteers were randomly assigned to 1 of 4 dose groups (5 μg, 10 μg, 20 μg LSD, and placebo), and received their assigned dose on six occasions (i.e., every 4 days). RESULTS: Forty-eight older healthy volunteers (mean age = 62.9 years) received placebo (n = 12), 5 μg (n = 12), 10 μg (n = 12), or 20 μg (n = 12) LSD. LSD plasma levels were undetectable for the 5 μg group and peak blood plasma levels for the 10 μg and 20 μg groups occurred at 30 min. LSD was well tolerated, and the frequency of adverse events was no higher than for placebo. Assessments of cognition, balance, and proprioception revealed no impairment. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest safety and tolerability of orally administered 5 μg, 10 μg, and 20 μg LSD every fourth day over a 21-day period and support further clinical development of LSD for the treatment and prevention of Alzheimer's disease (AD).","0"

"4915","Predicting efficacy of sub-anesthetic ketamine/esketamine i.v. dose during course of cesarean section for PPD prevention, utilizing traditional logistic regression and machine learning models.^\nOBJECTIVE: Increasing researches supported that intravenous ketamine/esketamine during the perioperative period of cesarean section could prevent postpartum depression(PPD). With the effective rate ranging from 87.2 % to 95.5 % in PPD, ketamine/esketamine's responsiveness was individualized. To optimize ketamine dose/form based on puerpera prenatal characteristics, reducing adverse events and improving the total efficacy rate, prediction models were developed to predict ketamine/esketamine's efficacy. METHOD: Based on two randomized controlled trials, 12 prenatal features of 507 women administered the ketamine/esketamine intervention were collected. Traditional logistics regression, SVM, random forest, KNN and XGBoost prediction models were established with prenatal features and dosage regimen as predictors. RESULTS: According to the logistic regression model (a(in) = 0.10, a(out) = 0.15, area under the receiver operating characteristic curve, AUC = 0.728), prenatal Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) score ≥ 10, thoughts of self-injury and bad mood during pregnancy were associated with poorer ketamine efficacy in PPD prevention, whilst a high dose of esketamine (0.25 mg/kg loading dose+2 mg/kg PCIA) was the most effective dosage regimen and esketamine was more recommended rather than ketamine in PPD. The AUC(validation set) of KNN and XGBoost model were 0.815 and 0.651, respectively. CONCLUSION: Logistic regression and machine learning algorithm, especially the KNN model, could predict the effectiveness of ketamine/esketamine iv. during the course of cesarean section for PPD prevention. An individualized preventative strategy could be developed after entering puerpera clinical features into the model, possessing great clinical practice value in reducing PPD incidence.","1"
"4640","Ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking while decreasing conventional convergent thinking.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ayahuasca is a South American psychotropic plant tea traditionally used in Amazonian shamanism. The tea contains the psychedelic 5-HT2A receptor agonist N,N-dimethyltryptamine (DMT), plus β-carboline alkaloids with monoamine oxidase-inhibiting properties. Increasing evidence from anecdotal reports and open-label studies indicates that ayahuasca may have therapeutic effects in treatment of substance use disorders and depression. A recent study on the psychological effects of ayahuasca found that the tea reduces judgmental processing and inner reactivity, classic goals of mindfulness psychotherapy. Another psychological facet that could potentially be targeted by ayahuasca is creative divergent thinking. This mode of thinking can enhance and strengthen psychological flexibility by allowing individuals to generate new and effective cognitive, emotional, and behavioral strategies. The present study aimed to assess the potential effects of ayahuasca on creative thinking. METHODS: We visited two spiritual ayahuasca workshops and invited participants to conduct creativity tests before and during the acute effects of ayahuasca. In total, 26 participants consented. Creativity tests included the ""pattern/line meanings test"" (PLMT) and the ""picture concept test"" (PCT), both assessing divergent thinking and the latter also assessing convergent thinking. RESULTS: While no significant effects were found for the PLMT, ayahuasca intake significantly modified divergent and convergent thinking as measured by the PCT. While convergent thinking decreased after intake, divergent thinking increased. CONCLUSIONS: The present data indicate that ayahuasca enhances creative divergent thinking. They suggest that ayahuasca increases psychological flexibility, which may facilitate psychotherapeutic interventions and support clinical trial initiatives.","0"
"9163","Ecstasy use in New Zealand: Findings from the 1998 and 2001 National Drug Surveys.^\nAims: To examine changes in the use of ecstasy, current conditions of supply, harms resulting from use, and the demographics of users. Methods: National Drug Surveys were conducted in 1998 and 2001. In each survey, a representative national sample of approximately 5500 people aged 15-45 years were asked about their drug use, including ecstasy use, using a Computer Assisted Telephone Interview (CATI) system. Response rates of 79% and 80% respectively were achieved. Results: Last-year use of ecstasy increased from 1.5% in 1998, to 3.4% in 2001. Large increases were found among men aged 20-24 (4.3% to 12.5%), and 25-29 (3.2% to 8.8%). In 2001, 43% of users thought ecstasy was easier to obtain and 29% thought the price was lower compared with a year earlier. About one in ten ecstasy users reported problems related to 'energy and vitality', 'financial position', 'health', and 'outlook on life'. Ecstasy users were predominately male, aged 20-29, European and single, but were from a broad range of occupational and income-earning groups. Conclusions: The use of ecstasy in New Zealand increased between 1998 and 2001. Conditions of supply became easier. Users reported problems related to use in a range of areas of their lives. There was little evidence to suggest ecstasy use was limited to high-income-earning professionals. © NZMA.","0"
"7573","Modulation of the functional connectome in major depressive disorder by ketamine therapy.^\nBackground: Subanesthetic ketamine infusion therapy can produce fast-acting antidepressant effects in patients with major depression. How single and repeated ketamine treatment modulates the whole-brain functional connectome to affect clinical outcomes remains uncharacterized. Methods: Data-driven whole brain functional connectivity (FC) analysis was used to identify the functional connections modified by ketamine treatment in patients with major depressive disorder (MDD). MDD patients (N = 61, mean age = 38, 19 women) completed baseline resting-state (RS) functional magnetic resonance imaging and depression symptom scales. Of these patients, n = 48 and n = 51, completed the same assessments 24 h after receiving one and four 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine infusions. Healthy controls (HC) (n = 40, 24 women) completed baseline assessments with no intervention. Analysis of RS FC addressed effects of diagnosis, time, and remitter status. Results: Significant differences (p < 0.05, corrected) in RS FC were observed between HC and MDD at baseline in the somatomotor network and between association and default mode networks. These disruptions in FC in MDD patients trended toward control patterns with ketamine treatment. Furthermore, following serial ketamine infusions, significant decreases in FC were observed between the cerebellum and salience network (SN) (p < 0.05, corrected). Patient remitters showed increased FC between the cerebellum and the striatum prior to treatment that decreased following treatment, whereas non-remitters showed the opposite pattern. Conclusion: Results support that ketamine treatment leads to neurofunctional plasticity between distinct neural networks that are shown as disrupted in MDD patients. Cortico-striatal-cerebellar loops that encompass the SN could be a potential biomarker for ketamine treatment. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved)","0"
"6644","The effects of psilocybin on the dynamics of eeg changes in human volunteers.^\nPsilocybin is a serotonergic psychedelic with an agonist activity at 5‐HT2A/C and 5‐HT1A receptors. It is used as a research tool to study neurobiology of psychosis as well as it is gaining attention as a possible therapeutic tool to treat depression, anxiety, and addiction. It has been already shown that psychedelics, including psilocybin, acutely induce desynchronization of the alpha activity occipitally and disconnection during the peak of intoxication. However, understanding of the dynamics of these changes has not been evaluated yet. Therefore, the current study focuses on the behavioral and EEG effects of psilocybin at several time points during the 6 hours of intoxication. Twenty volunteers with a balanced gender ratio (10 male/10 female) entered the study. Each participant underwent 2 sessions with oral psilocybin (0.26 mg/kg) or a placebo in a double‐blinded crossover design. In most of the subjects, psilocybin induced fully psychedelic effects as measured by psychometric scales, the effects peaked between 1 and 2 hours after administration. Decreased current density of the alpha band in the occipital region, which diminished over time was the most robust finding. The connectivity analyses showed biphasic effect on overall connectivity indicating two different connectivity states at the peak of intoxication and 6 hours after the ingestion. Results will be discussed in relation to the potential therapeutic effects of psilocybin.","0"
"2244","Major depression: The relative contribution of gender, MDMA, and cannabis use.^\nPrevious research has suggested that 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ecstasy) users have elevated depressive symptomatology, although it is not clear whether this is due to MDMA or other drug use. This study aimed to investigate the contributions of MDMA and cannabis use to Major Depressive Disorder in MDMA users. A total of 226 MDMA users were studied. Participants (65% male) reported an average number of 35.8 uses of MDMA (SD = 45.6, range = 2-400). Participants were administered a Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV. Twenty-six individuals (11.5%) met lifetime criteria for Major Depressive Disorder. High rates of lifetime Cannabis Abuse (30.1%) and Cannabis Dependence (12.4%) were reported. No association was found between number of uses of MDMA and Major Depressive Disorder. Those with lifetime major depression were found, however, to have higher rates of lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 2.40). A logistic regression indicated that lifetime cannabis use disorder, but not MDMA use, was significantly associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Stratified analyses suggested that for males, neither drug use variable was associated with major depression. For females, a lifetime cannabis use disorder (adjusted OR = 4.99), but not MDMA use, was associated with lifetime Major Depressive Disorder. Results of this study suggest that although MDMA use was not found to be significantly associated with major depression for either gender, a lifetime cannabis use disorder was significantly associated with lifetime major depression for female, but not male, users of MDMA.","0"
"8035","Neurobehavioral outcomes of infants exposed to MDMA (Ecstasy) and other recreational drugs during pregnancy.^\n3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) or ""Ecstasy"" is one of the most widely used illicit recreational drugs among young adults. MDMA is an indirect monoaminergic agonist and reuptake inhibitor that primarily affects the serotonin system. Preclinical studies in animals have found prenatal exposure related to neonatal tremors and long-term learning and memory impairments. To date, there are no prospective studies of the sequelae of prenatal exposure to MDMA in humans, despite concerns about its potential for harmful effects to the fetus. The present study is the first to prospectively identify MDMA-using women during pregnancy and to document patterns and correlates of use with neonatal and early infancy outcomes of offspring.All mothers and infants were prospectively recruited through the Case Western Reserve University (CWRU) and University of East London (UEL) Drugs and Infancy Study (DAISY) that focused on recreational drug use in pregnant women. Women were interviewed about substance use prior to and during pregnancy and infants were seen at 1 and 4. months using standardized, normative assessments of neonatal behavior, and cognitive and motor development, including the NICU Network Neurobehavioral Scale (NNNS), the Bayley Mental and Motor Development Scales (MDI, PDI), and the Alberta Infant Motor Scales (AIMS). The sample was primarily middle class with some university education and in stable partner relationships. The majority of women recruited had taken a number of illicit drugs prior to or during pregnancy. Group differences between those polydrug using women who had specifically used MDMA during pregnancy (n. =. 28) and those who had not (n. =. 68) were assessed using chi-square and t-tests. MDMA and other drug effects were assessed through multiple regression analyses controlling for confounding variables.Women who used MDMA during pregnancy had fewer prior births and more negative sequelae associated with their drug use, including more health, work, and social problems. MDMA exposed infants differed in sex ratio (more male births) and had poorer motor quality and lower milestone attainment at 4. months, with a dose-response relationship to amount of MDMA exposure. These findings suggest risk to the developing infant related to MDMA exposure and warrant continued follow-up to determine whether early motor delays persist or resolve. © 2012 Elsevier Inc.","0"
"9503","Co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against challenging experiences and enhance positive experiences.^\nPsilocybin and lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) experiences can range from very positive to highly challenging (e.g., fear, grief, and paranoia). These challenging experiences contribute to hesitancy toward psychedelic-assisted psychotherapy among health care providers and patients. Co-use of 3,4-Methylenedioxy methamphetamine (MDMA) with psilocybin/LSD anecdotally reduces challenging experiences and enhances positive experiences associated with psilocybin/LSD. However, limited research has investigated the acute effects of co-use of MDMA and psilocybin/LSD. In a prospective convenience sample (N = 698) of individuals with plans to use psilocybin/LSD, we examined whether co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (n = 27) is associated with differences in challenging or positive experiences. Challenging experiences were measured using the Challenging Experiences Questionnaire and positive experiences were measured using the Mystical Experience Questionnaire and single-item measures of self-compassion, compassion, love, and gratitude. Potentially confounding variables were identified and included as covariates. Relative to psilocybin/LSD alone, co-use of psilocybin/LSD with a self-reported low (but not medium-high) dose of MDMA was associated with significantly less intense total challenging experiences, grief, and fear, as well as increased self-compassion, love and gratitude. Co-use of psilocybin/LSD and MDMA was not associated with differences in mystical-type experiences or compassion. Findings suggest co-use of MDMA with psilocybin/LSD may buffer against some aspects of challenging experiences and enhance certain positive experiences. Limitations include use of a convenience sample, small sample size, and non-experimental design. Additional studies (including controlled dose-response studies) that examine the effects and safety of co-administering MDMA with psilocybin/LSD (in healthy controls and clinical samples) are warranted and may assist the development of personalized treatments.","0"
"7753","Acute LSD effects on response inhibition neural networks.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent evidence shows that the serotonin 2A receptor (5-hydroxytryptamine2A receptor, 5-HT2AR) is critically involved in the formation of visual hallucinations and cognitive impairments in lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD)-induced states and neuropsychiatric diseases. However, the interaction between 5-HT2AR activation, cognitive impairments and visual hallucinations is still poorly understood. This study explored the effect of 5-HT2AR activation on response inhibition neural networks in healthy subjects by using LSD and further tested whether brain activation during response inhibition under LSD exposure was related to LSD-induced visual hallucinations. METHODS: In a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, cross-over study, LSD (100 µg) and placebo were administered to 18 healthy subjects. Response inhibition was assessed using a functional magnetic resonance imaging Go/No-Go task. LSD-induced visual hallucinations were measured using the 5 Dimensions of Altered States of Consciousness (5D-ASC) questionnaire. RESULTS: Relative to placebo, LSD administration impaired inhibitory performance and reduced brain activation in the right middle temporal gyrus, superior/middle/inferior frontal gyrus and anterior cingulate cortex and in the left superior frontal and postcentral gyrus and cerebellum. Parahippocampal activation during response inhibition was differently related to inhibitory performance after placebo and LSD administration. Finally, activation in the left superior frontal gyrus under LSD exposure was negatively related to LSD-induced cognitive impairments and visual imagery. CONCLUSION: Our findings show that 5-HT2AR activation by LSD leads to a hippocampal-prefrontal cortex-mediated breakdown of inhibitory processing, which might subsequently promote the formation of LSD-induced visual imageries. These findings help to better understand the neuropsychopharmacological mechanisms of visual hallucinations in LSD-induced states and neuropsychiatric disorders.","0"
"3237","Efficacy and Safety of Ketamine in the Treatment of Neuropathic Pain: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis of Randomized Controlled Trials.^\nPURPOSE: Ketamine is a N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) antagonist with strong analgesic properties. Its addition to the treatment of neuropathic pain may reduce pain intensity and improve overall quality of life. A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials was performed to investigate the addition of ketamine to the treatment of patients with neuropathic pain. PATIENTS AND METHODS: GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation) approach was used to rate the overall certainty of the evidence for each outcome. Eighteen (18) randomized controlled trials including 706 participants were included for further analysis. RESULTS: Ketamine addition to standard treatment of neuropathic pain (NP) resulted in a statistically significant reduction of pain intensity at one week after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -2.14, 95% CI -2.65 to -1.63; p<0.00001) and after 30 days after the end of treatment with ketamine (MD -1.68, 95% CI -2.25 to -1.12; p<0.00001) and a statistically significant increase in discomfort (RR 4.06; 95% CI 1.18 to 13.95; p=0.03), and psychedelic effects (RR 4.94; 95% CI 2.76 to 8.84; p<0.00001). CONCLUSION: There is a statistically significant pain reduction by adding ketamine to the treatment of chronic NP when compared to the standard treatment. However, such pain reduction comes at the expense of adverse outcomes, especially psychedelic effects related to the administration of ketamine. However, the overall quality of certainty of evidence is low due to the clinical heterogeneity among the intervention characteristics of the trials analyzed (different administration routes, dosing regimen, therapy durations, different clinical characteristics of the population investigated). Future large multi-centered trials are necessary to confirm or not the results of the present review.","0"
"6679","Human pharmacology of mephedrone: a dose-finding pilot study.^\nAims: Mephedrone is a synthetic cathinone included in the “Novel Psychoactive Substances” group. European epidemiological data showed a high prevalence of use. There are not experimental data in humans of the pharmacological effects of mephedrone. Objective was to obtain preliminary data on the effects of mephedrone and doses for future investigations. Methods: Nine healthy male, recreational users of psychostimulants, participated as outpatients in three different experimental sessions, in which one of the substances was administered each day. They received single oral doses of mephedrone (n = 3, 50 mg, 100mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and placebo; n = 3, 150 mg, 200mg and MDMA 100 mg). Drugs were administered doubleblind, and randomised (lower doses were allocated before higher doses for safety reasons in case of 150mg and 200 mg). Study variables included: vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects (visual analog scales‐VAS, ARCI‐ 49 item short form, VESSPA questionnaire), and blood and urine samples for pharmacokinetics. Results: Mephedrone produced effects at 150 and 200 mg, with dose‐related increases of blood pressure, heart rate and pupil diameter (but not temperature). Mephedrone produced more intense effects than MDMA. Mephedrone induced pleasurable effects (ARCI‐MBG, VAS “good effects”, VAS “liking”), and mild changes in perceptions but not hallucinations. Conclusions: Mephedrone produces dose‐related effects in vital parameters and pleasurable subjective effects. Its pharmacologic profile is similar to MDMA and other psychostimulants.","2"
"4151","MDMA use and neurocognition: A meta-analytic review.^\nRationale: To determine the association between MDMA misuse and neurocognition using meta-analysis. Objective: Separate analyses were conducted based on two sets of inclusion/exclusion criteria. A relatively stringent set required that the subjects be matched on important moderator variables, whereas the other did not. The study participants' performance in the following neurocognitive domains was reviewed: attention/concentration, verbal and nonverbal learning and memory, psychomotor speed and executive systems functioning. Results: In the 11 studies meeting the relatively stringent inclusion/exclusion criteria for this review, MDMA use was associated with neurocognitive deficits in each domain. Similarly, in the 23 studies meeting the relatively lenient inclusion/exclusion criteria for this review, MDMA use was associated with neurocognitive deficits in each domain. Small to medium effect sizes were generally observed. A comparison of the effect sizes across the two sets of analyses did not reveal significant differences. Conclusions: The findings from this review reveal that MDMA use is associated with neurocognitive deficits. The implications of these findings are discussed. © 2006 Springer-Verlag.","3"
"8749","Change in patient-centered outcomes of psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality following treatment with intravenous ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To examine whether psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved with treatment with intravenous (IV) ketamine for late-life treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: This is an analysis of secondary outcomes in an open-label late-life TRD study examining the safety, tolerability, and feasibility of IV ketamine infusions. In the acute phase, participants (N = 25) aged 60 years or older received twice-a-week IV ketamine for 4 weeks. Then, participants with Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) total score <10 or ≥ 30% reduction from baseline proceeded to the continuation phase, an additional four weeks of once-a-week IV ketamine. The secondary outcomes analyzed here are based on the National Institute of Health Toolbox Psychological Well-Being subscales for Positive Affect and General Life Satisfaction, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and the Scale for Suicidal Ideation. RESULTS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved during the acute phase and those improvements were sustained during the continuation phase. Greater improvements in measures of psychological well-being and sleep were seen in participants who had greater improvements in MADRS scores and moved onto the continuation phase. All but one of the few participants with high suicidality at baseline improved; there were no cases of treatment-emergent suicidality. CONCLUSIONS: Psychological well-being, sleep, and suicidality improved in participants with late-life TRD who received IV ketamine for 8 weeks. A future larger and longer controlled trial is needed to confirm and extend these findings. REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04504175.","0"
"4971","Which neuroreceptors mediate the subjective effects of MDMA in humans? A summary of mechanistic studies.^\nIn preclinical studies, 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, 'Ecstasy') has been shown to release serotonin (5-HT), dopamine and norepinephrine. However, the role of these neurotransmitters and their corresponding receptor sites in mediating the subjective effects of MDMA has not yet been studied in humans. Therefore, we investigated the effects of three different neuroreceptor pretreatments on the subjective, cardiovascular and adverse effects of MDMA (1.5 mg/kg orally) in 44 healthy human volunteers. Pretreatments were: the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor citalopram (40 mg intravenously) in 16 subjects, the 5-HT(2) antagonist ketanserin (50 mg orally) in 14 subjects, and the D(2) antagonist haloperidol (1.4 mg intravenously) in 14 subjects. Each of these studies used a double-blind placebo-controlled within-subject design and all subjects were examined under placebo, pretreatment, MDMA and pretreatment plus MDMA conditions. Citalopram markedly reduced most of the subjective effects of MDMA, including positive mood, increased extraversion and self-confidence. Cardiovascular and adverse effects of MDMA were also attenuated by citalopram. Haloperidol selectively reduced MDMA-induced positive mood but had no effect on other subjective effects of MDMA or the cardiovascular or adverse responses to MDMA. Ketanserin selectively reduced MDMA-induced perceptual changes and emotional excitation. These results indicate that the overall psychological effects of MDMA largely depend on carrier-mediated 5-HT release, while the more stimulant-like euphoric mood effects of MDMA appear to relate, at least in part, to dopamine D(2) receptor stimulation. The mild hallucinogen-like perceptual effects of MDMA appear to be due to serotonergic 5-HT(2) receptor stimulation. Copyright 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.","0"
"687","Effects of perioperative intravenous low dose of ketamine on postoperative analgesia in children.^\nBACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Low dose of ketamine reduces postoperative pain and opioid consumption in adult studies. However, there are only a few data with controversial results in the paediatric population. The aim of this randomized controlled trial was to evaluate the use of low doses of intravenous ketamine on postoperative pain in children after surgery on the lower part of the body. METHODS: Thirty-seven children with ASA 1 or 2 from 6 to 60 months of age, undergoing scheduled surgery, were prospectively enrolled in a double blind sequential trial using a triangular test, with analysis every 10 patients treated. The children were randomly assigned to intravenously receive saline or 0.15 mg kg(-1) ketamine before surgery, followed by a continuous infusion of 1.4 microg kg(-1) min(-1) over 24 h. After sevoflurane induction and tracheal intubation, a caudal anaesthesia was performed in all children (1 ml kg(-1) of bupivacaine 0.25% with epinephrine). The postoperative analgesic technique was standardized with intravenous paracetamol 15 mg kg(-1) 6 h(-1), rectal morniflumate (20 mg kg(-1) 12 h(-1)) and intravenous nalbuphine infusion 1.2 mg kg(-1) 24 h(-1) for 24 h. The Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario Pain Scale (CHEOPS) scores, additional bolus of nalbuphine (if CHEOPS >7) and side effects were recorded from eye opening every 2 h over 24 h. The primary endpoint was the CHEOPS area under the curve. RESULTS: There was no difference in terms of additional bolus of nalbuphine as well as CHEOPS score area under the curve between groups, that is, 76 +/- 10 in the ketamine group versus 74 +/- 7 in the control group. No psychomimetic side effects were noted. CONCLUSION: The study failed to show any evidence of benefit of ketamine to improve analgesia in children when given in addition to a multimodal analgesic therapy with paracetamol, a NSAID and an opiate.","0"
"5466","Positron emission tomographic evidence of toxic effect of MDMA (""Ecstasy"") on brain serotonin neurons in human beings.^\nBACKGROUND: (+/-)3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ""Ecstasy"") is a popular recreational drug that selectively damages brain serotonin (5-HT) neurons in animals at doses that closely approach those used by humans. We investigated the status of brain 5-HT neurons in MDMA users. METHODS: We enrolled 14 previous users of MDMA who were currently abstaining from use and 15 controls who had never used MDMA. We used positron emission tomography (PET) with the radioligand carbon-11-labelled McN-5652, which selectively labels the 5-HT transporter. We analysed whether there were differences in 5-HT transporter binding between abstinent MDMA users and participants in the control group. Blood and urine samples were taken and tested to check for abstinence. FINDINGS: MDMA users showed decreased global and regional brain 5-HT transporter binding compared with controls. Decreases in 5-HT transporter binding positively correlated with the extent of previous MDMA use. INTERPRETATION: Quantitative PET studies with a ligand selective for 5-HT transporters can be used to assess the status of 5-HT neurons in the living human brain. We show direct evidence of a decrease in a structural component of brain 5-HT neurons in human MDMA users.","0"
"5646","Pattern of cannabis use in ecstasy polydrug users: moderate cannabis use may compensate for self-rated aggression and somatic symptoms.^\nCannabis is one of the most common 'co-drugs' for ecstasy users. The aim of the present study was to explore self-reported psychobiological problems in ecstasy polydrug users in relation to their pattern of cannabis use. Two hundred and eighty ecstasy polydrug users were allocated into five cannabis groups according to the frequency of their cannabis use. The control group comprised 121 alcohol-tobacco users. There were no significant group differences with regard to age, diagnosed family psychiatric history and level of self-rated stress experienced during 6 months prior to the study. The present study produced three main findings: (a) Ecstasy users with no concomitant use of cannabis displayed more self-rated aggression and somatic symptoms compared with ecstasy users who were smoking cannabis on a monthly or weekly basis. (b) Ecstasy users who reported heavy cannabis use in the past displayed higher paranoid symptoms compared with ecstasy weekly and daily cannabis users. (c) Former heavy cannabis users were the most likely to complain of a variety of ecstasy related long-term problems. In conclusion, moderate cannabis use may help to ameliorate or mask MDMA-induced aggressivity and somatic symptoms. However, this study confirms that heavy cannabis and ecstasy use is associated with several psychobiological problems, which may emerge after a period of abstinence from both drugs.","0"
"2017","Rapid relief of treatment resistant depression by facilitated ketamine infusion: A preliminary report.^\nBy combining transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) with intravenous ketamine therapy, we sought to increase the therapeutic value of TMS and, at the same time, to improve the efficacy of intravenous ketamine therapy among depressed patients previously classified as non-responders. In this preliminary report, we provide evidence for a new and much more reliable method of treating patients with treatment resistant depression. Twenty-eight patients with various degrees of treatment unresponsive depression were treated with a combination of TMS and ketamine infusion. Of these patients, twenty received pretreatment for 3 days to 2 weeks involving intensive (thrice daily) rTMS treatment administered 6 or 7 days/week or priming TMS treatment immediately prior to the combination TMSketamine infusion combination therapy. Eight patients received neither pretreatment nor priming. All of the 28 patients who did fully participate in the first month of treatment experienced relief of psychiatric symptoms, and showed significant psychosocial recovery. In contrast to previous studies examining ketamine or rTMS individually, the positive outcomes presented here suggest a synergistic effect of the combination therapy of TMS and ketamine infusion.","0"

"1237","A novel study design to evaluate the rapid reduction of the symptoms of major depressive disorder, including suicidal ideation, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide.^\nBackground: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is associated with an elevated rate of mortality, primarily due to suicide. The risk of suicide in those with MDD is about 20 times that of the general population, with approximately half of all suicides occurring in depressed individuals. While conventional antidepressants are often effective in treating depressive symptoms including suicidal ideation (SI), their delayed onset of action significantly limits their utility in the treatment of patients with MDD who are at imminent risk of for suicide. Recently, several studies of ketamine and esketamine have demonstrated that these agents can improve symptoms of depression in individuals with MDD within hours of administration. Additionally, preliminary studies of ketamine suggest it may have a similarly rapid effect in significantly reducing SI in subjects with MDD. As such, Janssen R&D is developing intranasal esketamine for the rapid reduction of the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in patients who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The pursuit of this novel indication has required the development of an innovative study design that allows for the detection of rapid symptom change, and addresses the safety and ethical concerns of studying an acutely suicidal patient population. This poster will discuss the design and implementation of PeRSEVERe (ESKETINSUI2001), an ongoing proof‐of‐concept study to evaluate the efficacy and safety of intranasal esketamine in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Methods: PeRSEVERe is an ongoing 12‐week, randomized, double‐blind, placebo‐controlled, multicenter Phase 2 study of intranasal esketamine in 70 adult subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Eligible subjects must have active suicidal ideation and intent, and be in need of psychiatric hospitalization. The primary objective is to evaluate the efficacy of intranasal esketamine 84 mg compared with intranasal placebo in reducing the symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide, as measured by the change from baseline on the MADRS total score at 4 hours post‐dose on Day 1. Secondary efficacy objectives include the assessment of single and repeated doses of intranasal esketamine compared with intranasal placebo on the clinician's assessment of suicide risk as measured by the Clinical Global Judgment of Suicide Risk from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool, and the subject's report of the severity in suicidal ideation as measured by the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, through the end of the double‐blind treatment and follow‐up phases. Additionally, the study evaluates response rates (≥ 50% reduction in MADRS total score from baseline, with onset by Day 1 sustained through the end of the double‐blind treatment phase) across treatment groups. Safety objectives include the assessment of dissociative and psychosis‐like symptoms, sedation, nasal tolerability, vital signs and suicidal thinking and behavior. The study consists of a 24‐48 hour screening evaluation performed prior to the Day 1 intranasal dose, immediately followed by a 25‐day double blind treatment phase, and a 56‐day follow up phase. Given the vulnerability of the patient population, the study is being conducted in the context of standard clinical care, with all subjects receiving standard antidepressant medication and initial in‐patient hospitalization. Results: PeRSEVERe is the first large‐scale, prospective, placebo‐controlled trial of a rapidly acting antidepressant in subjects with MDD who are assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. The study is being conducted in the United States and is currently ongoing, with over 70% of subjects enrolled. Details and rationale for the study design, outcome measures, and key efficacy times points will be discussed. Additionally, key operational insights and challenges unique to the study of a rapidly acting antidepressant in a suicidal patient population will e highlighted. Conclusions: PeRSERVERe employs innovative clinical trial methodology in a Phase 2 study for a novel indication, in a vulnerable patient population‐i.e. the rapid reduction of symptoms of MDD, including SI, in subjects assessed to be at imminent risk for suicide. Should this approach prove successful in Phase 2, similar methods will be considered in the design of subsequent pivotal trials of esketamine, and possibly other rapidly acting antidepressants. Results of PeRSERVERe are expected to be available in 2016.","0"
"4653","Depressive mood ratings are reduced by MDMA in female polydrug ecstasy users homozygous for the l-allele of the serotonin transporter.^\nMDMA exerts its main effects via the serotonergic system and the serotonin transporter. The gene coding for this transporter determines the expression rate of the transporter. Previously it was shown that healthy individuals with the short allelic variant ('s-group') of the 5-HTTLPR-polymorphism displayed more anxiety and negative mood, and had a lower transcriptional efficiency compared to individuals who are homozygous for the l-allele ('l-group'). The present study aimed to investigate the role of the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism in MDMA-induced mood effects. Four placebo-controlled, within-subject studies were pooled, including in total 63 polydrug ecstasy users (N(s-group) = 48; N(l-group) = 15) receiving MDMA 75 mg and placebo on two test days, separated by minimally 7 days. Mood was assessed by means of the Profile of Mood States. Findings showed that MDMA induced -independent of sex- a positive mood state, and as a side effect also increased two negative affect states, anxiety and confusion. Anxiety ratings were higher in the l-group and independent of treatment or sex. Depression ratings were lowered by MDMA in the female l-group. Findings indicate that the MDMA-induced reduction in self-rated depressive feelings is sex- and genotype-dependent, with females homozygous for the l-allele showing this beneficial effect.","1"
"9175","Cognitive Behavioral Therapy to Sustain the Antidepressant Effects of Ketamine in Treatment-Resistant Depression: A Randomized Clinical Trial.^\nINTRODUCTION: Ketamine has emerged as a rapid-acting antidepressant. While ongoing treatment can prevent relapse, concerns exist regarding long-term exposure. OBJECTIVE: We conducted a randomized trial to examine the feasibility and efficacy of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) following intravenous ketamine in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Subjects with TRD were recruited and treated with 6 intravenous infusions of ketamine over 3 weeks. Subjects who experienced a clinical response (≥50% improvement in depression severity) were then randomized to receiving CBT or treatment as usual (TAU) for an additional 14 weeks, using a sequential treatment model. RESULTS: Of the 42 patients who signed consent, 28 patients achieved a response and were randomized to CBT or TAU. When measured using the Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (primary outcome measure), the effect size at the end of the study was moderate (Cohen d = 0.65; 95% CI -0.55 to 1.82), though the group-by-time interaction effect was not significant. There was a significant group-by-time interaction as measured by the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (F = 4.58; p = 0.033), favoring a greater sustained improvement in the CBT group. This corresponded to a moderate-to-large effect size of the Cohen d = 0.71 (95% CI -0.30 to 1.70) at the end of the study (14 weeks following the last ketamine infusion). In a subset of patients (N = 20) who underwent cognitive testing using the emotional N-back assessments before and after ketamine, ketamine responders showed improvement in the accuracy of emotional N-back (t[8] = 2.33; p < 0.05) whereas nonresponders did not (t[10] <1; p ns). CONCLUSIONS: This proof-of-concept study provides preliminary data indicating that CBT may sustain the antidepressant effects of ketamine in TRD. Further study and optimization of this treatment approach in well-powered clinical trials is recommended.","0"
"7425","The effect of polymorphism at the serotonin transporter gene on decision-making, memory and executive function in ecstasy users and controls.^\nRationale: 3, 4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA or ""ecstasy"") is a popular drug of abuse known to result in depletions of the serotonin (5-HT) system. A number of studies have reported that ecstasy users differ from controls on a variety of measures of cognitive function. However, the literature is not consistent and many negative findings were also reported. One reason for such inconsistency might be interindividual variance in vulnerability to the deleterious effects of ecstasy due to a number of factors, both genetic and environmental. Objectives: To investigate the hypothesis that carriers of the s allele at the 5-HT transporter gene-linked polymorphic region (5-HTTLPR), which was associated with reduced serotonergic neurotransmission relative to the l allele, would be most vulnerable to the effects of ecstasy on cognitive function. Methods: We assessed memory, decision-making, and executive function in ecstasy users and controls, stratifying by genotype at the 5-HTTLPR. Results: We observed that the 5-HTTLPR genotype groups differed on a number of measures in both the ecstasy users and the controls. While performing a risky decision-making task, ss and ls controls attended to differences in the probability of winning chosen gambles to a greater extent than the ll controls. However, this difference was dramatically attenuated in the ss ecstasy users. Furthermore, independent of ecstasy use, volunteers of the ss genotype outperformed the ll genotype on a visual planning task. Conclusions: The results are consistent with the hypothesis that cognitive impairment in ecstasy users may depend on genetic variation at the 5-HTTLPR. © Springer-Verlag 2006.","4"

"1437","Cognitive function of patients with treatment-resistant depression after a single low dose of ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Clinical and animal studies have reported conflicting results regarding the effect of ketamine on cognitive function, although increasing evidence supports a rapid and sustained antidepressant effect of a subanesthetic dose of ketamine infusion for patients with treatment-resistant depression (TRD). However, the cognitive function before and after ketamine infusion was rarely investigated in patients with TRD. METHODS: A total of 71 adult patients with TRD were enrolled and randomized to 0.5-mg/kg ketamine, 0.2-mg/kg ketamine, or normal saline infusion groups. Depressive symptoms were measured using the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale at baseline and at different time points post ketamine infusion. Cognitive function was evaluated using working memory and go/no-go tasks at baseline, Day 3, and Day 14 post ketamine infusion. RESULTS: A single low dose of ketamine infusion did not impair the cognitive function of patients with TRD. The paired t test revealed that patients with TRD receiving 0.5 mg/kg of ketamine infusion exhibited a slight improvement in sustained attention and response control measured using the go/no-go task at Day 14 post ketamine infusion. A significant association was also observed between depressive symptoms and cognitive function changes at Day 3 in the 0.5-mg/kg ketamine infusion group. DISCUSSION: A 0.5 mg/kg dose of ketamine infusion was not harmful, but slightly beneficial, for the cognitive function of patients with TRD. Additional studies are necessary to elucidate the effects of repeated ketamine infusion on cognitive function.","0"
"6232","Effects of Repeated Psilocybin Dosing in OCD.^\nAim 1: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms among participants in the immediate treatment condition, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment condition. The investigators hypothesize that participants in the immediate treatment group will report statistically significantly greater symptom improvement from baseline 4 days post‐second dose, compared to participants in the waitlist control/delayed treatment group at the same interval during their waitlist phase. Aim 2: To examine the effects of two doses of psilocybin on OCD symptoms, compared to one dose. The investigators hypothesize that two doses of oral psilocybin will reduce OCD symptoms to a statistically significantly greater extent than one dose. This study aims to investigate the effects of repeated dosing of oral psilocybin on OCD symptomatology and assess psychological mechanisms that may mediate psilocybin's therapeutic effects on OCD. This study will employ a randomized, waitlist‐controlled design with blinded independent ratings, with participants randomized to receive either immediate treatment (two doses oral psilocybin separated by one week) or delayed treatment (7 weeks post‐randomization). An adaptive dose selection strategy will be implemented, with the first dose being standardized at 25 mg of psilocybin, and the second dose being either the same or a higher dosage (i.e., 30 mg) on the basis of a clinically significant response from baseline or not, respectively, 4 days post‐first dose. This study is conducted entirely on an outpatient basis with the possibility of remote/virtual follow‐up visits after each dosing session. The dosing sessions last the entire day, and participants will be medically cleared prior to being permitted to return home with assistance (e.g., driven by a family member or friend, or ride share).","4"
"996","Psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine: Dose versus effect relationships.^\nPsychotomimetic emergence phenomena following general anesthesia with ketamine are well documented, and affect 5-30% of patients. The psychotomimetic effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine have been less well studied. We administered ketamine or saline in single blinded, crossover fashion to 10 psychiatrically healthy volunteers using a computer-assisted continuous ketamine infusion that achieved a stepwise series of 5 constant plasma levels of ketamine, at 0, 5, 10, 15, and 20 jug/ml. After approximately 20 min at each level, to allow for equilibration with the biophase, the volunteer completed a visual analog rating of 13 psychotic and dissociative symptom scales involving color, reality, sounds, body parts, ideas of reference, surroundings, time, euphoria, out-of-control thoughts, anxiety, drowsiness and suspiciousness. Target ketamine levels were verified by measuring actual plasma concentration. Ketamine produced marked psychotomimetic effects that were doserelated in a highly linear fashion for all scales (r 0.92; p 0.03). Effects on anxiety, suspiciousness, and ideas of reference were weakest, attaining less than 22% of the maximum possible effect. For all other scales, 37-89% of the maximum possible effect was attained.","0"
"2105","Acute dose-response effects of LSD in healthy humans.^\nBackground: LSD (lysergic acid diethylamide) is a classic hallucinogen. It was widely studied in the 1950s to 1970s as an adjunct to psychotherapy (psycholytic therapy) and as a model to study psychotic states. Today, LSD is again in the focus of several investigations ranging from pharmacological research studies in healthy subjects [1‐3] to studies investigating LSD as a possible treatment for anxiety associated with terminal illness [4]. Because of the continued popularity of LSD as recreational drug and renewed interest in its therapeutic use we examined the acute response to two different doses of LSD in healthy subjects under controlled conditions. Methods: Data from two double‐blind, placebo controlled experimental studies were used to establish dose‐response relationships. Study 1 investigated the effects of 100mg LSD vs. Placebo and study 2 investigated the effects of 200mg LSD vs. Placebo. Both studies were performed in a cross‐over design. Twenty‐four subjects (12 men, 12 women; mean age 33±11 years) participated in Study 1, and 16 subjects (8 men, 8 women; mean Age 29±6 years) participated in Study 2. The inclusion and exclusion criteria were identical for both studies. Subjects younger than 25 years of age were excluded from participating in the study. Additional exclusion criteria were age >65 years, pregnancy, personal or family history of major psychiatric disorders, use of medications that may interfere with the study medication, chronic or acute physical illness, tobacco smoking (>10 cigarettes/day), and a lifetime prevalence of illicit drug use >10 times. Subjective effects were measured using validated psychometric tools including visual analog scales, adjective mood rating scale and the altered states of consciousness scale. Heart rate, blood pressure, and pupil size were also recorded. Further, we measured plasma concentration of LSD and its main metabolites in both studies to investigate pharmacokinetic ‐ pharmacodynamic relationships. Results: LSD produced positively‐experienced derealization and depersonalization and visual restructuralization including synaesthesia after 100 μg and 200 LSD in a dose‐dependent manner. Additionally, LSD produced empathic effects such as “closeness” “openness”, and “trust”. Empathic effects were found higher after 200 μg than after 100 μg. Subjective effects after 200 μg lasted up to 12 hours, and up to 10 hours after 100 μg. Negative associated effects, mainly transient anxiety, were more pronounced under 200 μg than after 100 μg. LSD did also moderately increase systolic and diastolic blood pressure, body temperature, and pupil size. LSD did not produce fearful reactions or negative experiences in this controlled setting. Conclusion: LSD induced mainly positive subjective effects in a dose‐dependent manner in a controlled laboratory setting in healthy subjects. Our findings show that 100 μg and 200 μg of LSD induce empathic effects to different degrees which is an important finding regarding its potential use in psycholytic therapy.","0"
"2245","Psilocybin induces aberrant prediction error processing for tactile mismatch responses.^\nBackground: The skin as the body's largest organ is our first contact point with the environment encoding information of many different sources as well as providing a sense of boundaries and the Self/Non‐Self discrimination – thus forming a backdrop of all perceptual experiences [1]. Predictive codes integrating bodily states and sensory inputs may give rise to self‐awareness and a sense of agency. Distortions in these processes have been linked to psychiatric symptoms like schizophrenic delusions [2]. However, the relationship between altered tactile prediction error (PE) processing and distorted self‐experience and its underlying neuropharmacology have never been empirically studied. Therefore, we investigated the effect of the preferential 5‐HT2A/1A receptor agonist psilocybin (Psi), known to induce alterations in self‐experience, on the processing of tactile mismatch responses by using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Methods: In this cross‐over, double‐blind, within‐subject, randomized and placebo‐controlled study, fifteen healthy participants (8 males, and 7 females, aged between 20–40 years) received a moderate dose of 0.2 mg/kg body weight p. o. oral administration of the 5‐HT2A/1A agonist Psi. Participants completed a roving oddball task while undergoing fMRI 85 minutes after Psi/Pla administration during peak of subjective Psi effects. To induce tactile mismatch responses, trains of stimuli switched randomly between high (double pulse) and low (single pulse) intensity after a variable number of 3 to 7 repetitions, generating an unpredictable sequence. The first stimulus of each train was modelled as the “Deviant (D)"" and the third repetition of each train as “Standard"" (S). All stimuli were delivered to the median nerve of the left forearm using a MR‐safe electrode and a constant current stimulator (Digitimer, DS7AH). The fMRI images were analyzed using a general linear model implemented in the SPM12 software package. The dependent variables were the fMRI BOLD contrasts D > S. Subjective effects were measured using the Altered State of Consciousness Rating Scale (5D‐ASC). 5D‐ASC scores were analyzed by using a repeated‐measures ANOVA design with treatment condition (Pla and Psi) and scale as within‐subject factors. Results: In response to unpredicted stimuli significant decreases in brain activity after Psi administration were detected for the D > S contrast in areas previously implicated in body awareness and tactile deviancy processing: thalamus, primary somatosensory cortex, midcingulate cortex and middle frontal gyrus. Further, Psi produced robust perceptual alterations of bodily awareness and self‐experience assessed with the rating scale 5D‐ASC. Conclusion: This study shows that Psi alters the integration of tactile stimuli through aberrant PE signalling, potentially the underlying mechanism of Psi‐induced alterations of self and body‐experience. Furthermore, it points to the important role of the 5‐HT2A/1A receptor subtypes in the processes of self‐experience. This finding may be relevant for the treatment of psychiatric disorders compromised by distorted self‐experience.","0"
"2912","Safety, pharmacokinetic, and pharmacodynamic evaluation of a noribogaine multiple-dose regimen in opioid-dependent subjects.^\nOpioid dependence is a significant public health issue. Improved non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatments to help opioid‐dependent individuals stop opioid use and remain abstinent are needed. Ibogaine has been explored as treatment for substance dependence, but its psychotomimetic effects limit its clinical utility. Noribogaine is an active metabolite of ibogaine and may be more selective in treating opioid dependence without undesirable psychotomimetic effects. Previous clinical studies evaluated single doses of noribogaine and suggested that it is safe and well‐tolerated, but with a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval. This study evaluated the safety, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of noribogaine HCl capsules after multiple dosing in treatment‐seeking opioid‐dependent subjects. Background: The development of treatments for opioid dependence, a significant public health issue, is of high importance. Educational objectives include: (1) describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, non‐opioid treatment for opioid dependence, (2) examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec) in multiple dose studies of drugs that exhibit a concentration‐dependent increase in the QTc interval, (3) recognize the importance of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependent population while acknowledging the challenges of studying this population. Methods: This was a phase 1B, open‐label, titration study conducted in an inpatient clinical unit. A loading dose of oral noribogaine 80 mg was followed by titrated maintenance dosing (10, 20, 30, or 40 mg, q6h) for up to 5 days. Maintenance dosing considered subjective and objective clinical assessments and QTcF using a predefined algorithm to avoid pronounced QT prolongation (QTcF >500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec was exclusionary). Standard safety evaluations, PK, and PD assessments (eg, opioid withdrawal and mood scales) were conducted. Continuous cardiac monitoring was performed via Holter monitor and telemetry. Results: Nine subjects (6 males; mean age 31.2 years) were enrolled. Documented opioid use included heroin and prescription opioids. Cumulative noribogaine doses ranged from 80mg to 670 mg, with 4 subjects administered the maximum 20 doses (mean 653 mg, range 640‐670 mg). No serious adverse events (AEs) were reported. Of treatmentemergent AEs, 96% were mild in severity, none were severe and 58% were opioid withdrawal‐related. Noribogaine plasma concentrations showed high intersubject variability, even between subjects with similar unit/daily/total doses. Cmax values following multiple dosing ranging from 52 to 252 (mean 102) ng/mL. After oral administration of noribogaine, observed plasma concentrations over time were consistent with an open, 2 compartment first‐order absorption model. Steady‐state was reached between 12 and 24 hours in a majority of subjects (5) and within 48 hours for the remaining (2). The largest ΔQTcF by subject ranged from 22‐51 msec (mean 33 msec). A concentration‐dependent increase in DQTcF was observed, corresponding to a predicted ΔQTcF of 17 msec at the geometric mean peak concentration of 89.1 ng/mL. No QTc changes resulted in AEs or discontinuation. Scores on withdrawal and mood scales decreased rapidly and substantially following administration of noribogaine, and this was supported by non‐solicited self‐reports that the withdrawal experience was less severe compared with previous attempts in the majority of subjects. Mean (SD) SOWS score at baseline was 30.3 (10.6) and declined to 16.8 (7.4) one hour after loading dose administration; at 51 hours post‐loading dose, mean SOWS score was 10.4 (9.7). Mean (SD) POMS total mood disturbance (TMD) score was 53.8 (22.2) at baseline and declined to 37.3 (43.3) at 57 hours post‐loading dose. Consistent with the expected time course of opioid withdrawal, 3 subjects experienced an increase in withdrawal symptoms 48‐72 h post the last pre‐t eatment opioid administration (mean of 11 h prior to noribogaine loading dose), 2 of whom withdrew from the study. All 4 subjects who remained in the clinic after 72 hours experienced further decreases in withdrawal and mood scores (SOWS: 4.8 (4.9) at 81 h; POMS TMD: 0.8 (4.6) at 84 h). Subjects returned to their pre‐treatment environment, largely devoid of support; 5 subjects relapsed, 3 were lost to follow‐up, and 1 remained abstinent (15 weeks). Conclusions: Noribogaine treatment for up to 5 days was well tolerated. The previously noted QTc effect was confirmed, and a dosing algorithm with QTc criteria was successful in avoiding pronounced QTc prolongation (i.e., no QTcF>500 msec or ΔQTcF >60 msec). Steady‐state noribogaine concentrations were reached rapidly with the use of a loading dose. Clinically significant reductions in withdrawal symptoms and mood assessments were seen following noribogaine administration. These findings support continued evaluation of noribogaine in treating opioid dependence under medical supervision in controlled clinical trials. Educational Objectives: At the conclusions of this activity, participants should be able to: 1. Describe noribogaine as a potential non‐addictive, nonopioid treatment for opioid dependence. 2. Examine the utility of a predefined dosing algorithm to avoid pronounced QTc prolongation. 3. Recognize the importance/challenge of conducting controlled clinical trials in the opioid‐dependents.","0"
"5378","Me, myself, bye: regional alterations in glutamate and the experience of ego dissolution with psilocybin.^\nThere is growing interest in the therapeutic utility of psychedelic substances, like psilocybin, for disorders characterized by distortions of the self-experience, like depression. Accumulating preclinical evidence emphasizes the role of the glutamate system in the acute action of the drug on brain and behavior; however this has never been tested in humans. Following a double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel group design, we utilized an ultra-high field multimodal brain imaging approach and demonstrated that psilocybin (0.17 mg/kg) induced region-dependent alterations in glutamate, which predicted distortions in the subjective experience of one's self (ego dissolution). Whereas higher levels of medial prefrontal cortical glutamate were associated with negatively experienced ego dissolution, lower levels in hippocampal glutamate were associated with positively experienced ego dissolution. Such findings provide further insights into the underlying neurobiological mechanisms of the psychedelic, as well as the baseline, state. Importantly, they may also provide a neurochemical basis for therapeutic effects as witnessed in ongoing clinical trials.","4"
"5020","[Analgesia-sedation for maxillo-facial surgery with midazolam-pentazocine and miazolam-ketamine. Clinical double-blind study of anxiety, analgesia, sedation and amnesia].^\nKetamine and midazolam, applied as intravenous medication for conscious sedation in day-case maxillo-facial surgery, has been proven to be superior to pentazocine and midazolam concerning cardiovascular parameters and respiratory depression. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of low-dose ketamine/midazolam on anxiety, analgesia, amnesia and subjective feelings. METHODS. 140 out-patients (ASA I) were randomly divided into four groups. The double-blind study was prospective. CONTROL GROUP: Local anaesthesia (LA), articaine 4% plus epinephrine 1:200,000 (n = 35); test group P/M: LA, additional pentazocine 0.40 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35); test group K25/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.25 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35), test group K50/M: LA, additionally ketamine 0.5 mg/kg bw and midazolam 0.075 mg/kg bw i.v. (n = 35). LA was injected 3 min after application of the systemic medication in the test groups or application of a placebo (saline 0.9%) in the control group. Three further minutes later, operation was started. For evaluation questionnaires, visual analogue scales (VAS) and the state-trait anxiety inventory (STAI) were used. For testing retrograde and anterograde amnesia, acoustic sensations were delivered before application of the systemic medication (a Christmas carol) and during operation (the German national anthem). RESULTS. The control group and the test groups were comparable with regard to biological data, duration of operation, applied dosage of local anaesthetics and actual anxiety before operation. The patients in all test groups rated intraoperative anxiety as mild, in contrast to the control group. Nearly no pain sensation during the operation was remembered in all test groups. Retrograde amnesia was not found in any group. Complete anterograde amnesia was observed in all test groups with respect to the intraoperative sensation, but even in the control group 50% of the patients did not remember having heard the national anthem. As subjective feelings negative criteria were mainly reported in the control group, where as in all test groups positive sensations dominated. Dreams were reported mostly after the higher dosage of ketamine, but no patient experienced any unpleasant dreams. The clinical assessment of the different regimes were excellent for test groups P/M and K50/M, modest for the control group and test group K25/M. Postoperatively, patients of test group P/M were remarkably sedated, but no clinically relevant sedation or motor weakness were observed in the other groups. Postoperative pain sensations were rated more intense in all test groups than in the control group. In test groups P/M and K25/M an increasing pain level was recorded during the postoperative period, with the consequence of a higher demand rate for analgesics. CONCLUSIONS. Dental surgery can be performed safely with low-dose ketamine/midazolam. Compared to pentazocine/midazolam, the higher dosage of ketamine (0.5 mg/kg bw) showed identical results intraoperatively, but was superior during the postoperative period (vigilance), and thus may represent a suitable dosage. The lower dosage of ketamine resulted in worse operating conditions, but a dosage higher than 0.5 mg/kg bw might lead to unconscious sedation and might increase the frequency of unpleasant dreams.","0"
"8836","Efficacy and Safety of a Rapid Intravenous Injection of Ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in Treatment-Resistant Major Depression: An Open 4-Week Longitudinal Study.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has been documented for its rapid antidepressant effects. However, optimal dose and delivery route have not yet been thoroughly investigated. The objectives of this study were to document the safety and test the antidepressant and antisuicidal effects of a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg in treatment-resistant depression (TRD). METHODS: Ten patients with TRD were included in an open, noncontrolled 4-week study and received a rapid intravenous dose of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg. Main outcome measure was the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale and suicidality was assessed using the Scale for Suicide Ideation. RESULTS: Rapid injection of ketamine elicited transient increase of blood pressure and altered states of consciousness in all patients and mild psychotomimetic effects in 4 patients, which all resolved without any intervention. Decrease of depression severity was observed from 40-minute postinjection until day 15. Eight patients became responders within 1 day and all were nonresponders after 4 weeks. The decrease of suicidal ideation was significant until day 7. Analysis indicated that higher severity of depression and anxiety at baseline predicted a larger Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale decrease after 4 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that in well-controlled medical settings with adequate monitoring, a single rapid 1-minute injection of ketamine 0.5 mg/kg can be well tolerated and is efficacious in rapidly reducing depression symptoms and suicidal thoughts in outpatients with TRD. These findings are relevant to the practice of general clinical psychiatry and emergency departments were ketamine can have a place in acute management of TRD. Larger studies are necessary to confirm these results.","0"
"3598","The Efficacy of Psilocybin in the Treatment of Depression and Anxiety: A Meta-Analysis.^\nBackground: The use of psychedelic compounds to treat psychiatric disorders has become a very significant topic of research over the past several years. Psilocybin has risen to prominence as one of the most studied among these psychedelic compounds. Multiple trials have already shown that it can be a safe and efficacious treatment for various medical conditions. This study intends to perform a meta-analysis of data reported in clinical trials studying psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety. Methods: Articles were searched, screened, and ultimately selected using predetermined inclusion criteria. Data was collected from commonly used psychometric tests that measured mood and anxiety symptoms. Effect sizes were calculated by comparing scores in these tests at baseline and control to experimental groups. Sub-group analysis was performed to assess psilocybin’s effect on depression and anxiety during short, medium, and long-term time frames. Results: Statistical significance was achieved in reducing depression and anxiety symptoms compared to controls in multiple subgroups. Heterogeneity of the effect sizes was calculated using an I2 value which showed low to moderate values. Multiple tools were used to assess publication bias, and none could be found. Conclusion: Although research on psilocybin continues to show promise, the evidence is still at a preliminary phase, and more trials need to be conducted with larger patient populations over longer periods for psilocybin to potentially be approved in a community setting.","3"
"5804","Greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine in males.^\nRATIONALE: Gender differences both in response to ketamine in animals and general cognitive functioning in humans have been observed and suggested to be related to modulatory effects of sex hormones on N-methyl-D: -aspartate receptor (NMDA-R) functioning. OBJECTIVES: The current study aimed to determine whether there were gender differences in response to ketamine in humans. METHODS: Behavioral data including positive and negative symptoms (Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale), perceptual alterations (Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale, CADSS), and ""high"" and ""anxiety"" states (Visual Analog Scale) from 295 subjects who participated in a total of 11 placebo-controlled ketamine studies were analyzed. In a subset of subjects, memory (Hopkins Verbal Learning Task: HVLT, n=108) and attention (continuous performance task, n=177) data were also analyzed. RESULTS: Male participants showed a greater performance decrement on the HVLT after ketamine administration compared to women. Men also reported a greater subjective sense of memory impairment on a CADSS subscale. No other gender differences in behavioral or cognitive measures were observed. CONCLUSIONS: Men showed a greater vulnerability to the amnestic effects of ketamine than women. Possible explanations of these findings are neuroanatomical and cognitive differences in processing of words in men and women and interactions between sex hormones and NMDA-R function.","0"
"4038","Psychedelic medicines for end-of-life care: Pipeline clinical trial review 2022.^\nOBJECTIVES: People with terminal illnesses often experience psychological distress and associated disability. Recent clinical trial evidence has stimulated interest in the therapeutic use of psychedelics at end of life. Much uncertainty remains, however, mainly due to methodological difficulties that beset existing trials. We conducted a scoping review of pipeline clinical trials of psychedelic treatment for depression, anxiety, and existential distress at end of life. METHODS: Proposed, registered, and ongoing trials were identified from 2 electronic databases (ClinicalTrials.gov and the World Health Organization International Clinical Trials Registry Platform). Recent reviews and both commercial and non-profit organization websites were used to identify additional unregistered trials. RESULTS: In total, 25 studies were eligible, including 13 randomized controlled trials and 12 open-label trials. Three trials made attempts beyond randomization to assess expectancy and blinding effectiveness. Investigational drugs included ketamine (n = 11), psilocybin (n = 10), 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (n = 2), and lysergic acid diethylamide (n = 2). Three trials involved microdosing, and fifteen trials incorporated psychotherapy. SIGNIFICANCE OF RESULTS: A variety of onging or upcoming clinical trials are expected to usefully extend evidence regarding psychedelic-assisted group therapy and microdosing in the end-of-life setting. Still needed are head-to-head comparisons of different psychedelics to identify those best suited to specific indications and clinical populations. More extensive and rigorous studies are also necessary to better control expectancy, confirm therapeutic findings and establish safety data to guide the clinical application of these novel therapies.","3"
"764","RESULTS FROM THE PHASE I SMALL PHARMA TRIAL OF SPL026 IN PSYCHEDELIC-NAÏVE HEALTHY VOLUNTEERS.^\nBackground/Objective: Small Pharma is conducting the world's first regulated Phase I/IIa clinical trial of SPL026 (N,Ndimethyltryptamine [DMT] fumarate), a psychedelic compound with a shortacting experience, in combination with psychotherapy, in major depressive disorder (MDD). Design: We have completed the Phase I component, a double‐blind, singleascending dose study, assessing safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics (PK), and pharmacodynamics (PD) of four intravenous (IV) doses of SPL026 with therapy in psychedelic‐naive healthy volunteers (6 active and 2 placebo per cohort). Results: SPL026 was safe and well tolerated, with no serious adverse events and few drug‐related adverse events across all dose cohorts. Detailed PK profiles for DMT were elucidated, and a model was developed to understand and predict the PK profiles of various doses of SPL026. DMT is rapidly metabolized, with a half‐life of about 11 minutes, which underpins the observed short psychedelic experiences of up to 30 minutes. Following PK/PD analysis, a strong exposureresponse relationship for both the intensity and quality of the psychedelic experience was demonstrated. In addition, no correlation between exposure versus age, weight, or body mass index (BMI) of subjects was shown. Conclusion: We have developed a safe and well‐tolerated IV infusion protocol and accompanying psychotherapy model for administration of SPL026 to elicit, in a dose‐predictive way, a significant psychedelic experience with the potential to provide therapeutic efficacy in a number of mental health disorders. Psychedelics, such as DMT, offer the potential of an alternative treatment paradigm to the traditional selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) or psychotherapy models currently available to patients. The results of the Phase IIa component are due in the coming months.","0"
"1738","Neuropsychological assessment of undergraduate marihuana and LSD users.^\nAn extended battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to three groups of college seniors (lysergic acid diethylamide [LSD]/mescaline users; marihuana/hashish users; and controls) who were matched on predrug usage intellectual and personality dimensions. The study was replicated one yr later. In the combined years' analyses, the three groups showed statistically significant differences only on the Trail Making Test: LSD/mescaline users performed within normal limits but significantly worse than either of the other two groups. Since the three groups also differed significantly in the extent of their alcohol usage, a covariance analysis was carried out that indicated that this variable did not account for the LSD/mescaline group's performance on the Trail Making Test. Inference about possible organic dysfunction cannot be drawn from these findings, but prospective neuropsychological testing might prove useful. (15 references).","4"
"7554","Ketamine augmentation rapidly improves depression scores in inpatients with treatment-resistant bipolar depression.^\nOBJECTIVE: To study the clinical effect of a single ketamine infusion, 0.5 mg/kg body weight, in bipolar depressive patients receiving mood-stabilising drugs, not improving on antidepressants. Previously, in such patients, we had found a correlation between clinical efficacy, serum brain-derived neurotrophic factor and vitamin B12 levels and a rapid improvement in neurocognitive performance. METHODS: The study included 53 patients (13 men, 40 women), aged 22-81 years, receiving ≥1 mood-stabilising medications of the first and/or second generation. Pre-infusion depression intensity on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS) was 23.4 ± 4.6 points and the assumed criterion for response was a reduction of ≥50% in the HDRS score after 7 days. RESULTS: Twenty-seven subjects (51%) met a criterion for response, more frequently males (77%) than females (43%). Responders did not differ from non-responders as to age, illness onset, duration of depressive episode, type of bipolar illness, family history of psychiatric illness, personal/family history of alcoholism or using lithium, quetiapine or a combination of these mood stabilisers. CONCLUSIONS: The results confirm a rapid antidepressant effect of ketamine infusion in a considerable proportion of those patients with bipolar depression receiving mood-stabilising drugs. Apart from male gender, no other clinical factors were predictors of response.","0"
"6121","A Multi-Site Phase 3 Study of MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy for PTSD II.^\nPTSD is a serious debilitating disorder that negatively impacts a person's daily life. PTSD is a stress‐related psychiatric condition that may occur following a traumatic event such as war, disaster, sexual abuse, violence, terrorism, and accidents. PTSD negatively impacts a person's daily life, resulting in relationship difficulties, difficulty in finding and maintaining a job, reduced cognitive and psychosocial functioning, substance abuse, high‐cost healthcare use, and increased depression and suicide risk. Available PTSD treatments, including medications and therapy, effectively treat only a fraction of people who try them for adequate dose and duration. People with PTSD can be treated with psychotherapies and pharmacotherapies. In the past decade, there has been a growing amount of research into medications and other methods that may augment the effectiveness of psychotherapy for PTSD. 3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) is a drug that releases serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine in the brain and indirectly increases levels of the neurohormones oxytocin, arginine vasopressin and cortisol. The combined neurobiological effects of MDMA increase compassion, reduce defenses and fear of emotional injury, and enhance communication and introspection. MDMA produces anxiolytic and prosocial effects, which counteract avoidance and hyperarousal in the context of therapy. A combined treatment of MDMA and psychotherapy may be especially useful for treating PTSD. This multi‐site, double‐blind, randomized Phase 3 study assesses the efficacy and safety of MDMA‐assisted psychotherapy versus psychotherapy with placebo control in participants diagnosed with at least severe posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The study will be conducted in N ≈ 100 participants. Participants will be enrolled in one of two groups at a 1:1 ratio. A flexible dose of MDMA or placebo, followed by a supplemental half‐dose unless contraindicated, is administered during the Treatment Period with manualized psychotherapy in three monthly Experimental Sessions. This 12‐week Treatment Period is preceded by three Preparatory Sessions. During the Treatment Period, each Experimental Session is followed by three Integrative Sessions of non‐drug psychotherapy. The Primary Outcome measure is change in Clinician Administered PTSD Scale for DSM 5 (CAPS‐5) from Baseline. Exploratory measures will address specific symptoms, or behavior that is sometimes related to PTSD. Drug safety will be assessed by measuring blood pressure, heart rate and body temperature during experimental sessions, collecting adverse events and measuring suicidal thoughts or behaviors with the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (CSSRS). This study will compare the effects of three manualized Experimental Sessions of psychotherapy supported by assisted by flexible doses of MDMA versus placebo. Initial doses per Experimental Session include 80 mg or 120 mg of MDMA compounded with mannitol and magnesium stearate or placebo alone (mannitol and magnesium stearate), followed 1.5 to 2 hours later by a supplemental half‐dose (40 or 60 mg). Total amounts of MDMA to be administered per Experimental Session range from 80 mg to 180.","0"
"7224","Ketamine normalizes brain activity during emotionally valenced attentional processing in depression.^\nBACKGROUND: An urgent need exists for faster-acting pharmacological treatments in major depressive disorder (MDD). The glutamatergic modulator ketamine has been shown to have rapid antidepressant effects, but much remains unknown about its mechanism of action. Functional MRI (fMRI) can be used to investigate how ketamine impacts brain activity during cognitive and emotional processing. METHODS: This double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover study of 33 unmedicated participants with MDD and 26 healthy controls (HCs) examined how ketamine affected fMRI activation during an attentional bias dot probe task with emotional face stimuli across multiple time points. A whole brain analysis was conducted to find regions with differential activation associated with group, drug session, or dot probe task-specific factors (emotional valence and congruency of stimuli). RESULTS: A drug session by group interaction was observed in several brain regions, such that ketamine had opposite effects on brain activation in MDD versus HC participants. Additionally, there was a similar finding related to emotional valence (a drug session by group by emotion interaction) in a large cluster in the anterior cingulate and medial frontal cortex. CONCLUSIONS: The findings show a pattern of brain activity in MDD participants following ketamine infusion that is similar to activity observed in HCs after placebo. This suggests that ketamine may act as an antidepressant by normalizing brain function during emotionally valenced attentional processing.

"7041","Pharmacological effects of methylone and MDMA in humans.^\nMethylone is one of the most common synthetic cathinones popularized as a substitute for 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, midomafetamine) owing to its similar effects among users. Both psychostimulants exhibit similar chemistry (i.e., methylone is a β-keto analog of MDMA) and mechanisms of action. Currently, the pharmacology of methylone remains scarcely explored in humans. Herein, we aimed to evaluate the acute pharmacological effects of methylone and its abuse potential in humans when compared with that of MDMA following oral administration under controlled conditions. Seventeen participants of both sexes (14 males, 3 females) with a previous history of psychostimulant use completed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, crossover clinical trial. Participants received a single oral dose of 200 mg of methylone, 100 mg of MDMA, and a placebo. The variables included physiological effects (blood pressure, heart rate, oral temperature, pupil diameter), subjective effects using visual analog scales (VAS), the short form of the Addiction Research Center Inventory (ARCI), the Evaluation of Subjective Effects of Substances with Abuse Potential questionnaire (VESSPA-SSE), and the Sensitivity to Drug Reinforcement Questionnaire (SDRQ), and psychomotor performance (Maddox wing, psychomotor vigilance task). We observed that methylone could significantly increase blood pressure and heart rate and induce pleasurable effects, such as stimulation, euphoria, wellbeing, enhanced empathy, and altered perception. Methylone exhibited an effect profile similar to MDMA, with a faster overall onset and earlier disappearance of subjective effects. These results suggest that abuse potential of methylone is comparable to that of MDMA in humans.

"5598","Oral ketamine for depression: An updated systematic review.^\nObjectives: Ketamine is a glutamate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist that can be used to treat major depressive disorder by single or repeated infusions. However, the accessibility and scalability of oral ketamine make it preferred over intravenous ketamine. In this systematic review, we aim to evaluate the efficacy, tolerability, and safety of oral ketamine, esketamine and r-ketamine for unipolar and bipolar depression. Materials and methods: Electronic databases were searched from inception to September 2022 to identify relevant articles. Results: Twenty-two studies, including four randomized clinical trials (RCTs), one case series, six case reports, five open-label trials and six retrospective chart review studies involving 2336 patients with depression were included. All included studies reported significant improvement following ketamine administration. Ketamine was well tolerated without serious adverse events. However, RCTs had a high risk of bias due to analysis methods and adverse events monitoring. Ketamine dosage varied from 0.5 to 1.25 mg/kg. The frequency of administration was daily to monthly. Several important limitations were identified, most notably the small number of RCTs. Conclusions: Taken together, preliminary evidence suggests the potential for antidepressant effect of oral ketamine. However, further research with large sample size and long follow-up period is needed to better determine the antisuicidal effect and efficacy in treatment-resistant depression.","0"
"6228","LSD Treatment for Persons With Alcohol Use Disorder.^\nAlcohol use causes more overall harm than any other drug and is the seventh leading risk factor for both deaths and disability‐adjusted life years. Alcohol use disorders (AUD) are among the most common and undertreated mental disorders in developed countries. Pharmacological and psychotherapeutic treatments only show limited efficacy and around 60% of the patients relapse in short‐term after withdrawal. Lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) was extensively investigated in the 1950s and 1960s and became one of the best‐studied psychoactive substances with several thousands of early scientific reports. Specifically, the use of LSD in the treatment of AUD was investigated extensively. A pooled analysis of six historical clinical trials demonstrated, that a single dose of LSD significantly reduced alcohol use at three and six months after LSD administration and the improvements surpassed treatment with established psychopharmacological interventions. However, these historical studies do not meet today's methodological standards which limits the validity of these findings. Well‐designed studies are needed to further investigate this promising treatment approach. Therefore, the present study aims to evaluate safety and efficacy of LSD for the treatment of AUD. The trial has a double‐blind, active placebo‐controlled, randomized, parallel design and will be conducted in three specialized treatment centers for addictive disorders in Switzerland. The study will include 128 patients after withdrawal treatment and will primarily assess the efficacy of LSD for relapse prevention after standard detoxification. Patients will be treated using a 1:1 allocation. In the first session, patients in the treatment group will receive a dose of 150 µg LSD, followed by another 150 µg or 250 µg LSD in the second session, which will take place approximately 4 weeks after the first session. The primary outcome is the mean of percent heavy drinking days after administration of two doses of LSD at 3 months' follow‐up. Additionally, other alcohol associated parameters and associated common comorbidities as well as potential predictors and mediators for treatment response will be assessed.","0"
"6954","Adjunct Ketamine Use in the Management of Severe Ethanol Withdrawal.^\nOBJECTIVES: Ketamine offers a plausible mechanism with favorable kinetics in treatment of severe ethanol withdrawal. The purpose of this study is to determine if a treatment guideline using an adjunctive ketamine infusion improves outcomes in patients suffering from severe ethanol withdrawal. DESIGN: Retrospective observational cohort study. SETTING: Academic tertiary care hospital. PATIENTS: Patients admitted to the ICU and diagnosed with delirium tremens by Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders V criteria. INTERVENTIONS: Pre and post guideline, all patients were treated in a symptom-triggered fashion with benzodiazepines and/or phenobarbital. Postguideline, standard symptom-triggered dosing continued as preguideline, plus, the patient was initiated on an IV ketamine infusion at 0.15-0.3 mg/kg/hr continuously until delirium resolved. Based upon withdrawal severity and degree of agitation, a ketamine bolus (0.3 mg/kg) was provided prior to continuous infusion in some patients. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were included (29 preguideline; 34 postguideline). Patients treated with ketamine were less likely to be intubated (odds ratio, 0.14; p < 0.01; 95% CI, 0.04-0.49) and had a decreased ICU stay by 2.83 days (95% CI, -5.58 to -0.089; p = 0.043). For ICU days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for alcohol level and total benzodiazepine dosing. For hospital days outcome, correlation coefficients were significant for patient age, aspartate aminotransferase, and alanine aminotransferase level. Regression revealed the use of ketamine was associated with a nonsignificant decrease in hospital stay by 3.66 days (95% CI, -8.40 to 1.08; p = 0.13). CONCLUSIONS: Mechanistically, adjunctive therapy with ketamine may attenuate the demonstrated neuroexcitatory contribution of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor stimulation in severe ethanol withdrawal, reduce the need for excessive gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist mediated-sedation, and limit associated morbidity. A ketamine infusion in patients with delirium tremens was associated with reduced gamma-aminobutyric acid agonist requirements, shorter ICU length of stay, lower likelihood of intubation, and a trend toward a shorter hospitalization.","0"
"1961","Glutamate and the neural basis of the subjective effects of ketamine: a pharmaco-magnetic resonance imaging study.^\nCONTEXT: Ketamine evokes psychosislike symptoms, and its primary action is to impair N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptor neurotransmission, but it also induces secondary increases in glutamate release. OBJECTIVES: To identify the sites of action of ketamine in inducing symptoms and to determine the role of increased glutamate release using the glutamate release inhibitor lamotrigine. DESIGN: Two experiments with different participants were performed using a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized, crossover, counterbalanced-order design. In the first experiment, the effect of intravenous ketamine hydrochloride on regional blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal and correlated symptoms was compared with intravenous saline placebo. In the second experiment, pretreatment with lamotrigine was compared with placebo to identify which effects of ketamine are mediated by increased glutamate release. SETTING: Wellcome Trust Clinical Research Facility, Manchester, England. PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-three healthy, right-handed men were recruited by advertisements. INTERVENTIONS: In experiment 1, participants were given intravenous ketamine (1-minute bolus of 0.26 mg/kg, followed by a maintenance infusion of 0.25 mg/kg/h for the remainder of the session) or placebo (0.9% saline solution). In experiment 2, participants were pretreated with 300 mg of lamotrigine or placebo and then were given the same doses of ketamine as in experiment 1. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Regional BOLD signal changes during ketamine or placebo infusion and Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale and Clinician-Administered Dissociative States Scale scores. RESULTS: Ketamine induced a rapid, focal, and unexpected decrease in ventromedial frontal cortex, including orbitofrontal cortex and subgenual cingulate, which strongly predicted its dissociative effects and increased activity in mid-posterior cingulate, thalamus, and temporal cortical regions (r = 0.90). Activations correlated with Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale psychosis scores. Lamotrigine pretreatment prevented many of the BOLD signal changes and the symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: These 2 changes may underpin 2 fundamental processes of psychosis: abnormal perceptual experiences and impaired cognitive-emotional evaluation of their significance. The results are compatible with the theory that the neural and subjective effects of ketamine involve increased glutamate release.","2"
"4506","LSD Increases Primary Process Thinking via Serotonin 2A Receptor Activation.^\nRationale: Stimulation of serotonin 2A (5-HT2A) receptors by lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) and related compounds such as psilocybin has previously been shown to increase primary process thinking - an ontologically and evolutionary early, implicit, associative, and automatic mode of thinking which is typically occurring during altered states of consciousness such as dreaming. However, it is still largely unknown whether LSD induces primary process thinking under placebo-controlled, standardized experimental conditions and whether these effects are related to subjective experience and 5-HT2A receptor activation. Therefore, this study aimed to test the hypotheses that LSD increases primary process thinking and that primary process thinking depends on 5-HT2A receptor activation and is related to subjective drug effects. Methods: Twenty-five healthy subjects performed an audio-recorded mental imagery task 7 h after drug administration during three drug conditions: placebo, LSD (100 mcg orally) and LSD together with the 5-HT2A receptor antagonist ketanserin (40 mg orally). The main outcome variable in this study was primary index (PI), a formal measure of primary process thinking in the imagery reports. State of consciousness was evaluated using the Altered State of Consciousness (5D-ASC) rating scale. Results: LSD, compared with placebo, significantly increased primary index (p < 0.001, Bonferroni-corrected). The LSD-induced increase in primary index was positively correlated with LSD-induced disembodiment (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected), and blissful state (p < 0.05, Bonferroni-corrected) on the 5D-ASC. Both LSD-induced increases in primary index and changes in state of consciousness were fully blocked by ketanserin. Conclusion: LSD induces primary process thinking via activation of 5-HT2A receptors and in relation to disembodiment and blissful state. Primary process thinking appears to crucially organize inner experiences during both dreams and psychedelic states of consciousness.","0"
"8947","Anterior default mode network and posterior insular connectivity is predictive of depressive symptom reduction following serial ketamine infusion.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine is a rapidly-acting antidepressant treatment with robust response rates. Previous studies have reported that serial ketamine therapy modulates resting state functional connectivity in several large-scale networks, though it remains unknown whether variations in brain structure, function, and connectivity impact subsequent treatment success. We used a data-driven approach to determine whether pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging measures predict changes along symptom dimensions of depression following serial ketamine infusion. METHODS: Patients with depression (n = 60) received structural, resting state functional, and diffusion MRI scans before treatment. Depressive symptoms were assessed using the 17-item Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS-17), the Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (IDS-C), and the Rumination Response Scale (RRS) before and 24 h after patients received four (0.5 mg/kg) infusions of racemic ketamine over 2 weeks. Nineteen unaffected controls were assessed at similar timepoints. Random forest regression models predicted symptom changes using pretreatment multimodal neuroimaging and demographic measures. RESULTS: Two HDRS-17 subscales, the HDRS-6 and core mood and anhedonia (CMA) symptoms, and the RRS: reflection (RRSR) scale were predicted significantly with 19, 27, and 1% variance explained, respectively. Increased right medial prefrontal cortex/anterior cingulate and posterior insula (PoI) and lower kurtosis of the superior longitudinal fasciculus predicted reduced HDRS-6 and CMA symptoms following treatment. RRSR change was predicted by global connectivity of the left posterior cingulate, left insula, and right superior parietal lobule. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support that connectivity of the anterior default mode network and PoI may serve as potential biomarkers of antidepressant outcomes for core depressive symptoms.","0"
"7903","Ketamine amplifies induced gamma frequency oscillations in the human cerebral cortex.^\nAt subanaesthetic doses, ketamine, an N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist, has demonstrated remarkable and rapid antidepressant efficacy in patients with treatment-resistant depression. The mechanism of action of ketamine is complex and not fully understood, with altered glutamatergic function and alterations of high-frequency oscillatory power (Wood et al., 2012) noted in animal studies. Here we used magnetoencephalography (MEG) in a single blind, crossover study to assess the neuronal effects of 0.5 mg/kg intravenous ketamine on task-related high-frequency oscillatory activity in visual and motor cortices. Consistent with animal findings, ketamine increased beta amplitudes, decreased peak gamma frequency in visual cortex and significantly amplified gamma-band amplitudes in motor and visual cortices. The amplification of gamma-band activity has previously been linked in animal studies to cortical pyramidal cell disinhibition. This study provides direct translatable evidence of this hypothesis in humans, which may underlie the anti-depressant actions of ketamine.

"7442","Psilocybin microdosers demonstrate greater observed improvements in mood and mental health at one month relative to non-microdosing controls.^\nPsilocybin microdosing involves repeated self-administration of mushrooms containing psilocybin at doses small enough to not impact regular functioning. Microdose practices are diverse and include combining psilocybin with substances such as lion's mane mushrooms (Hericium erinaceus; HE) and niacin (vitamin-B3). Public uptake of microdosing has outpaced evidence, mandating further prospective research. Using a naturalistic, observational design, we followed psilocybin microdosers (n = 953) and non-microdosing comparators (n = 180) for approximately 30 days and identified small- to medium-sized improvements in mood and mental health that were generally consistent across gender, age and presence of mental health concerns, as we all as improvements in psychomotor performance that were specific to older adults. Supplementary analyses indicated that combining psilocybin with HE and B3 did not impact changes in mood and mental health. However, among older microdosers combining psilocybin, HE and B3 was associated with psychomotor improvements relative to psilocybin alone and psilocybin and HE. Our findings of mood and mental health improvements associated with psilocybin microdosing add to previous studies of psychedelic microdosing by using a comparator group and by examining the consistency of effects across age, gender, and mental health. Findings regarding the combination of psilocybin, HE and B3 are novel and highlight the need for further research to confirm and elucidate these apparent effects.","0"
"5936","Increased use of ketamine for the treatment of depression: Benefits and concerns.^\nKetamine was initially used as an anesthetic which could induce cognitive impairment and psychomimetic effects. In initial randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that mostly included a small sample size and were investigator-initiated, ketamine reportedly exerted antidepressant effects 1 to 2 h after a single intravenous infusion in patients with major depressive episodes, particularly treatment-resistant depression (TRD). Interest in ketamine was reported in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, however, many were primarily focused on the rapid onset of ketamine effects without equal attention to its safety and tolerability. Furthermore, several meta-analyses were based on many duplicated RCTs. The initial trends emphasized the clinical utility of ketamine as an antidepressant. The development of esketamine nasal spray by a pharmaceutical company led to an RCT with a large sample size and segmented therapeutic strategy, which provided results applicable to patients with TRD in the real-world clinical environment. However, possible effects of ketamine on cognitive function have not yet been investigated in RCTs. In numerous studies, chronic, recreational use of ketamine reportedly substantially impaired cognitive function in most domains. Although results of several human and animal studies indicated the therapeutic use of ketamine for treatment of depression did not induce cognitive impairment, this issue should be further investigated. Based on the current knowledge about ketamine, future antidepressants are expected to be glutamatergic drugs without ketamine-like adverse events (e.g., psychomimetic symptoms and cognitive impairment), but having only ketamine-like therapeutic properties (e.g., rapid antidepressants effects without time lag).","3"

The intervention was developed so it could be used by peer and other drug workers. The evaluation was a two-condition, multi-site, randomized controlled trial with a single 6-month follow-up. Participants were 16-22 years old. They identified themselves to be primary users of cocaine hydrochloride, crack cocaine, or ecstasy and were subsequently assigned to these primary stimulant groups for analysis. No participant had been in treatment during the previous 12 months and none had a treatment history for opiate dependence or injecting. Trial participants were recruited in 11 sites in Greater London and Kent using detached outreach, specific advertising campaigns, and by participant-driven snowball-sampling methods. Six-month follow-up interviews were successfully conducted with 299 participants. The participant recruitment methodology used in the trial was successful, showing that longitudinal, experimental studies with young out-of-treatment drug users are quite feasible. There were a range of positive changes reported by participants in both the experimental and control conditions. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","0"

Administered to healthy individuals, a subanesthetic dose of the noncompetitive NMDAR antagonist ketamine reproduces several psychopathological symptoms commonly observed in patients with schizophrenia. In a counterbalanced, placebo-controlled, double-blind, within-participants study, fifteen healthy subjects were administered a continuous subanesthetic S-ketamine infusion while cortical activation was measured using functional magnetic resonance imaging. While being scanned, subjects performed an overt word generation task. Ketamine-induced psychopathological symptoms were assessed with the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS). Ketamine administration elicited effects on psychopathology, including difficulties in abstract thinking, lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation as well as formal thought disorder. On a behavioral level, verbal fluency performance was unaffected. The PANSS score for formal thought disorder positively correlated with activation measures encompassing the left superior temporal gyrus, the right middle and inferior frontal gyrus and the precuneus. Difficulty in abstract thinking was correlated with pronounced activations in prefrontal as well as in anterior cingulate regions, whereas hyperactivations in the left superior temporal gyrus were found in association with a lack of spontaneity and flow of conversation. In the absence of behavioral impairments during verbal fluency, NMDAR blocking evoked psychopathological symptoms and cortical activations in regions previously reported in schizophrenia patients. The results provide further support for the hypothesis of an NMDAR dysfunction in the pathophysiology of schizophrenia.","0"

Use of buprenorphine follow standard of care, and the investigators are investigating the additive power of adjunctive psilocybin to enhance opioid abstinence, treatment adherence, quality of life, and mood. The study will consist of a brief (6‐8 day) inpatient phase for standard buprenorphine induction as well as experimental psilocybin administration, an 8‐week outpatient phase involving standard buprenorphine maintenance and experimental follow‐up meetings, and long‐term follow‐up sessions for 4 months after. During the inpatient phase, participants will be inducted onto sublingual (SL) buprenorphine (using a buprenorphine/naloxone combination product) while admitted to the Bayview Clinical Research Unit. During this time, participants will also undergo 2‐3 preparatory sessions, and will undergo an experimental drug administration session under supportive conditions, during which the participants will receive either a very low dose (1 mg) or a single high (30mg) oral dose of psilocybin under double‐blind conditions. At the end of the inpatient phase, participants will be discharged to complete the 8‐week outpatient phase, during which participants will undergo visits at 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post‐dosing session for monitoring of adverse events, clinical status, treatment adherence, and to receive a weekly supply of buprenorphine. All buprenorphine procedures will be open label and will follow standard‐of‐care practices. This trial utilizes a Bayesian sequential methodology, employing a maximum sample size of 90 participants and calculating Bayes factors (starting at 20 participants and assessed after each 10) to assess evidence for the null and experimental hypotheses, enabling potential early stopping for efficacy or futility based on predetermined thresholds (Bayes factor of 6 and 1/6).

"4410","Phase II, randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Esketamine as an adjunct to standard care in patients with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder- OCD.^\nINTERVENTION: D27.505.954.427.700.122 In a crossover design, all participants will receive an infusion of 0.045mg/kg midazolam (active placebo) and another infusion of 0.5mg/kg esketamine, with an interval of two weeks between procedures. All study infusions will be administered intravenously over 40 minutes through an infusion pump. Randomization will be performed in blocks, ensuring that half of the patients initially receive midazolam infusion and the other half of the patients initially receive esketamine. Crossing between the blocks will be performed, so that all patients receive both interventions. Participants will be randomly assigned into two distinct groups through a list of random numbers, keeping allocation concealment preserved. Regarding masking, the same investigator responsible for the allocation will prepare the drugs. Study solutions will be provided in identical 50mL syringes containing midazolam or escetamine with the additional volume of saline solution for a total of 50mL. Midazolam and escetamine form a clear solution when dissolved in 0.9% saline, making it impossible to distinguish active treatment from control by visual inspection. The active placebo used, midazolam, is a medication known to not interfere with OCD symptoms, that is, it does not worsen and does not treat. It is a short‐acting benzodiazepine with a rapid onset of action, a short elimination half‐life, and a similar time course of dissociative and non‐specific behavioral effects (eg, sedation, disorientation) to escetamine, thus providing adequate blinding ( Shiroma, 2020). Such medication is widely used in clinical trials (Peyrovian, 2020; Dakwar, 2020; Rothberg, 2020), with data in the literature proving the safety of its use in OCD patients (Bloch 2012, Rodriguez 2017).

It is expected to find a significant reduction, i.e. greater than or equal to 35% in the total score on the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale. A mixed linear fixed effects model will be used to examine the differences between esketamine and midazolam treatment. A composite symmetry covariance structure appears to be the best fit to the data. The constrained maximum likelihood estimate will be used to analyze incomplete data. Significant effects will be examined with simple effects tests. Significance is assessed at P < 0.05, two‐tailed. SECONDARY OUTCOME: To assess changes from baseline scores for 24h, 7, and 14 days after each infusion in the placebo and control groups on the Clinical Global Impression for Severity and Improvement and the Montgomery‐Asberg Depression Rating Scale. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the change in the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale total score before each infusion to 7 and 14 days after the procedure between the placebo group and the control group. We will use the same method described for the primary outcome; To assess the proportion of responders (participants who achieved a reduction of at least 35% of symptoms by the Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale) of the placebo group and the control group after 24h, 7 and 14 days after each infusion. To assess the proportion of individuals who respond or remit at each point, a McNemar test will be used at each point for the participants and the results will be Bonferroni corrected for the number of points examined. Wilcoxon Rank Sum test will be used to compare severity of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms, severity of depressive symptoms (if any) and percentage of cumulative reduction of obsessive‐compulsive symptoms compared to percentage of reduction of depressive symptoms; To evaluate clinical and biological markers (peripheral biomarkers such as BDNF, IL‐1, IK6, TNF‐alpha, IF , microRNAs and serum esketamine level) and their correspondence with therapeutic response. We will use t‐tests to assess differences in the dosages of these markers at different collection periods and between treatment groups. Pearson's correlation analysis will be used to determine the relationship between Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale scores and serum marker levels. Finally, a linear regression model will be used to evaluate the effect of each marker as a possible predictor of Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale scores. To verify the safety of the intervention both in the placebo group and in the control group through the instruments Clinician Administrated Dissociative States Scale, Brief Psychiatric Assessment Scale and Young Mania Scale; INCLUSION CRITERIA: Female or male subjects, 18 to 65 years of age; Each participant must have a sufficient level of understanding to understand all procedures and the informed consent form; Participants must complete for Obsessive‐Compulsive Disorder in accordance with the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, for at least one year, as assessed by a structured diagnostic interview, The Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, version 7.0.2, with a Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale score of at least 16 points ;Treatment resistance defined as at least one prior attempt at an adequate dose and duration of a serotonin reuptake inhibitor or clomipramine and/or cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention or having refused these treatments for individual reasons;Individuals should not have changes in the dosage of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or clomipramine by pe least two months before enrollment in the study","0"
"3371","The effects of sub-anaesthetic doses of ketamine on memory, cognitive performance and subjective experience in healthy volunteers.^\nExamined cognitive and subjective effects of subanesthetic doses of ketamine on 12 healthy volunteers. Ss received 25 mg ketamine, 10 mg ketamine and saline placebo, intramuscular/ly (im) in a double-blind, Latin square design. A cognitive, perceptual and self-report test battery was administered over 45 min. The order of tests was rotated to control for timing effects. Ketamine (25 mg) significantly affected verbal learning and memory, parallel visual search, some measures of psychomotor performance, measures of arousal, subjective mood ratings and visual perception. Measures of attention and frontal lobe functioning were relatively unaffected. Thus, low doses of ketamine had selective, dose-related effects on memory, perceptual and psychomotor functions. The disruption of memory and perceptual processes may help to explain the unique subjective state induced by ketamine. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2016 APA, all rights reserved)","0"
"791","Low-dose MDMA increases responses to psychosocial stress in healthy human volunteers.^\nBackground: ±3,4‐methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, “ecstasy”) is a widely used stimulant‐psychedelic hybrid drug that enhances feelings of empathy and social closeness. These prosocial effects are thought to contribute to its widespread use. Recent evidence from behavioral and neuroimaging studies in human volunteers has suggested that MDMA may act to dampen reactivity to negative social stimuli, such as social threat, rejection, and amygdala activation in response to threatening faces. In line with these findings, MDMA has recently been considered as a potential treatment for post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and anxiety disorders due to its ability to reduce reactivity to negative emotional events and build trust in the therapeutic relationship. However, the effects of low doses of MDMA on responses to an acute social stressor have not been tested. Here we examined the effects of a relatively low dose of MDMA on subjective and physiological responses to a stressful public speaking task in healthy adult volunteers. Methods: Based on evidence suggesting MDMA dampens responses to social threat, we hypothesized that the drug would reduce responses to the stressful task. Healthy adult volunteers (N = 26) were randomly assigned to receive placebo or 0.5 mg/kg MDMA under double‐blind conditions. They attended two sessions, during which they performed either a stressful public speaking task (Trier Social Stress Test) consisting of a verbal and mental arithmetic portion or a non‐stressful control task. Throughout the sessions, the participants provided subjective reports on the effects of the drug, their mood, and how stressful they found the task. Measures of salivary cortisol, heart rate, and blood pressure were obtained at regular intervals, in addition to measures of autonomic activity (high frequency heart rate variability and impedance cardiography). Results: As expected, the stress task effectively increased heart rate, blood pressure, salivary cortisol, and subjective ratings of stress in both groups. Contrary to our hypothesis, MDMA potentiated the subjective and cortisol responses to stress, and decreased participants' ratings of self‐efficacy before the task. MDMA did not increase any indices of stress on the non‐stressful control session. Conclusions: While the relatively low dose of MDMA administered here appears to reduce responses to negative social stimuli in some contexts, it did not reduce either the subjective or objective responses during this stressful public speaking task. In fact, this low dose of MDMA seems to increase some aspects of responses to acute psychosocial stress. This finding is consistent with anxiogenic effects of some stimulant drugs, but it is at odds with evidence suggesting higher doses of MDMA reduce reactivity to negative social stimuli. It is notable that only higher doses of MDMA have been shown to increase plasma oxytocin, which has been proposed as a mechanism for MDMA's prosocial effects. It remains to be determined whether higher doses of MDMA, including doses that increase oxytocin levels, do dampen stress responses.","0"
"8606","Anxiolytic effects of acute and maintenance ketamine, as assessed by the Fear Questionnaire subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Rating Scale.^\nBACKGROUND: Ketamine has rapid anxiolytic effects in treatment-resistant obsessive compulsive, post-traumatic stress, generalised anxiety and social anxiety disorders. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to assess changes following acute and maintenance ketamine therapy on the Fear Questionnaire (FQ) subscales and the Spielberger State Anxiety Inventory (SSAI). METHODS: This secondary analysis used data from a mixed open-label and double-blinded placebo-controlled study. A total of 24 patients received short-term ascending subcutaneous doses of ketamine and were then eligible to enter a 3-month maintenance phase of 1 mg/kg ketamine dosed once or twice weekly. FQ and SSAI data were analysed using mixed models to identify between-dose differences and to describe trends during maintenance. RESULTS: Acute ketamine dosing showed a rapid dose-related reduction in all three FQ subscales (agoraphobia, social phobia and blood-injury phobia) and in the SSAI. A progressive decrease in pre-dose rating-scale scores was evident during the 3 months of maintenance therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Ketamine demonstrated dose-related improvements in all FQ subscales and in the SSAI. Both scales appear to be suitable tools to assess the anxiolytic effects of ketamine in patients with treatment-resistant anxiety. Furthermore, ketamine appears to have broad, dose-related anti-phobic effects. These findings raise the possibility that ketamine may have therapeutic potential in the treatment of other phobic states, such as specific phobia.","0"
"5698","The safety and efficacy of {+/-}3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine-assisted psychotherapy in subjects with chronic, treatment-resistant posttraumatic stress disorder: the first randomized controlled pilot study.^\nCase reports indicate that psychiatrists administered ±3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) as a catalyst to psychotherapy before recreational use of MDMA as 'Ecstasy' resulted in its criminalization in 1985. Over two decades later, this study is the first completed clinical trial evaluating MDMA as a therapeutic adjunct. Twenty patients with chronic posttraumatic stress disorder, refractory to both psychotherapy and psychopharmacology, were randomly assigned to psychotherapy with concomitant active drug (n = 12) or inactive placebo (n = 8) administered during two 8-h experimental psychotherapy sessions. Both groups received preparatory and follow-up non-drug psychotherapy. The primary outcome measure was the Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale, administered at baseline, 4 days after each experimental session, and 2 months after the second session. Neurocognitive testing, blood pressure, and temperature monitoring were performed. After 2-month follow-up, placebo subjects were offered the option to re-enroll in the experimental procedure with open-label MDMA. Decrease in Clinician-Administered PTSD Scale scores from baseline was significantly greater for the group that received MDMA than for the placebo group at all three time points after baseline. The rate of clinical response was 10/12 (83%) in the active treatment group versus 2/8 (25%) in the placebo group. There were no drug-related serious adverse events, adverse neurocognitive effects or clinically significant blood pressure increases. MDMA-assisted psychotherapy can be administered to posttraumatic stress disorder patients without evidence of harm, and it may be useful in patients refractory to other treatments.","0"
"6898","A randomized, crossover comparison of ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy for treatment of major depressive episodes: a Canadian biomarker integration network in depression (CAN-BIND) study protocol.^\nBACKGROUND: Recent evidence underscores the utility of rapid-acting antidepressant interventions, such as ketamine, in alleviating symptoms of major depressive episodes (MDE). However, to date, there have been limited head-to-head comparisons of intravenous (IV) ketamine infusions with other antidepressant treatment strategies in large randomized trials. This study protocol describes an ongoing multi-centre, prospective, randomized, crossover, non-inferiority trial comparing acute treatment of individuals meeting diagnostic criteria for a major depressive episode (MDE) with ketamine and electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) on efficacy, speed of therapeutic effects, side effects, and health care resource utilization. A secondary aim is to compare a 6-month maintenance strategy for ketamine responders to standard of care ECT maintenance. Finally, through the measurement of clinical, cognitive, neuroimaging, and molecular markers we aim to establish predictors and moderators of treatment response as well as treatment-elicited effects on these outcomes. METHODS: Across four participating Canadian institutions, 240 patients with major depressive disorder or bipolar disorder experiencing a MDE are randomized (1:1) to a course of ECT or racemic IV ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) administered 3 times/week for 3 or 4 weeks. Non-responders (< 50% improvement in Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS] scores) crossover to receive the alternate treatment. Responders during the randomization or crossover phases then enter the 6-month maintenance phase during which time they receive clinical assessments at identical intervals regardless of treatment arm. ECT maintenance follows standard of care while ketamine maintenance involves: weekly infusions for 1 month, then bi-weekly infusions for 2 months, and finally monthly infusions for 3 months (returning to bi-weekly in case of relapse). The primary outcome measure is change in MADRS scores after randomized treatment as assessed by raters blind to treatment modality. DISCUSSION: This multi-centre study will help identify molecular, imaging, and clinical characteristics of patients with treatment-resistant and/or severe MDEs who would benefit most from either type of therapeutic strategy. In addition to informing clinical practice and influencing health care delivery, this trial will add to the robust platform and database of CAN-BIND studies for future research and biomarker discovery.

"6022","Study of the Effects of MDMA/Ecstasy on Water Regulation, Sleep, and Cognition.^\nThis is a placebo‐controlled, double‐blind, gender balanced, within‐subject study on the acute and 24 to 48 hour post dose effects (discontinuation syndrome) of MDMA on sleep architecture, water homeostasis and neurocognitive function. We will define the signs and symptoms of sleep disruption and time course of alterations in ADH levels and neurocognitive function occurring after administration of a single dose of MDMA in experienced users. The immediate effects of MDMA include euphoria and intoxication; at 24 hours after MDMA these positive effects are replaced by lowered mood and lethargy ‐ we refer to these effects as a discontinuation syndrome. The pleasurable effects of MDMA are thought to be due to elevations of serotonin, norepinephrine and dopamine; the mechanisms of post‐MDMA depression are unknown but may be due to relative serotonin depletion. Among its many functions serotonin maintains normal sleep architecture. The effects of MDMA discontinuation on sleep architecture will be assessed using comprehensive polysomnography and wrist actigraphy with measures obtained 36 hours after a single dose of MDMA. Cognitive measurements will explore the acute effects of MDMA. MDMA can produce hyponatremia. In this study we will evaluate the effects of MDMA on ADH release, urine sodium excretion, and the relationship of gender to these effects.","4"
"2516","Human pharmacology of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) after repeated doses taken 4 h apart Human pharmacology of MDMA after repeated doses taken 4 h apart.^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA, ecstasy) is a popular psychostimulant, frequently associated with multiple administrations over a short period of time. Repeated administration of MDMA in experimental settings induces tolerance and metabolic inhibition. The aim is to determine the acute pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetics resulting from two consecutive 100mg doses of MDMA separated by 4h. Ten male volunteers participated in a randomized, double-blind, crossover, placebo-controlled trial. The four conditions were placebo plus placebo, placebo plus MDMA, MDMA plus placebo, and MDMA plus MDMA. Outcome variables included pharmacological effects and pharmacokinetic parameters. After a second dose of MDMA, most effects were similar to those after a single dose, despite a doubling of MDMA concentrations (except for systolic blood pressure and reaction time). After repeated MDMA administration, a 2-fold increase was observed in MDMA plasma concentrations. For a simple dose accumulation MDMA and MDA concentrations were higher (+23.1% Cmax and +17.1% AUC for MDMA and +14.2% Cmax and +10.3% AUC for MDA) and HMMA and HMA concentrations lower (-43.3% Cmax and -39.9% AUC for HMMA and -33.2% Cmax and -35.1% AUC for HMA) than expected, probably related to MDMA metabolic autoinhibition. Although MDMA concentrations doubled after the second dose, most pharmacological effects were similar or slightly higher in comparison to the single administration, except for systolic blood pressure and reaction time which were greater than predicted. The pharmacokinetic-effects relationship suggests that when MDMA is administered at a 4h interval there exists a phenomenon of acute tolerance to its effects.","2"
"1829","Reduction in social anxiety after MDMA-assisted psychotherapy with autistic adults: a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled pilot study.^\nRATIONALE: Standard therapeutic approaches to reduce social anxiety in autistic adults have limited effectiveness. Since 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA)-assisted psychotherapy shows promise as a treatment for other anxiety disorders, a blinded, placebo-controlled pilot study was conducted. OBJECTIVES: To explore feasibility and safety of MDMA-assisted psychotherapy for reduction of social fear and avoidance that are common in the autistic population. METHODS: Autistic adults with marked to very severe social anxiety were randomized to receive MDMA (75 to 125 mg, n = 8) or inactive placebo (0 mg, n = 4) during two 8-h psychotherapy sessions (experimental sessions) in a controlled clinical setting. Double-blinded experimental sessions were spaced approximately 1 month apart with 3 non-drug psychotherapy sessions following each. The primary outcome was change in Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale (LSAS) Total scores from Baseline to one month after the second experimental session. Outcomes were measured again six months after the last experimental session. RESULTS: Improvement in LSAS scores from baseline to the primary endpoint was significantly greater for MDMA group compared to the placebo group (P = 0.037), and placebo-subtracted Cohen's d effect size was very large (d = 1.4, CI - 0.074, 2.874). Change in LSAS scores from baseline to 6-month follow-up showed similar positive results (P = 0.036), with a Cohen's d effect size of 1.1 (CI - 0.307, 2.527). Social anxiety remained the same or continued to improve slightly for most participants in the MDMA group after completing the active treatment phase. CONCLUSIONS: This pilot trial demonstrated rapid and durable improvement in social anxiety symptoms in autistic adults following MDMA-assisted psychotherapy. Initial safety and efficacy outcomes support expansion of research into larger samples to further investigate this novel treatment for social anxiety.

"1240","Efficacy and Safety of Intranasal Esketamine for the Rapid Reduction of Symptoms of Depression and Suicidality in Patients at Imminent Risk for Suicide: Results of a Double-Blind, Randomized, Placebo-Controlled Study.^\nOBJECTIVE: The authors compared the efficacy of standard-of-care treatment plus intranasal esketamine or placebo for rapid reduction of symptoms of major depression, including suicidality, among individuals at imminent suicide risk. METHOD: In a double-blind, multicenter, proof-of-concept study, 68 participants were randomly assigned to receive esketamine (84 mg) or placebo twice weekly for 4 weeks, in addition to comprehensive standard-of-care treatment. The primary efficacy endpoint was change in score from baseline to 4 hours after initial dose on the Montgomery-Åsberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS). Clinician global judgment of suicide risk (from the Suicide Ideation and Behavior Assessment Tool) was also assessed. Secondary endpoints included these measures at 24 hours and double-blind endpoint at day 25. RESULTS: A significantly greater improvement in MADRS score was observed in the esketamine group compared with the placebo group at 4 hours (least-square mean difference=-5.3, SE=2.10; effect size=0.61) and at ∼24 hours (least-square mean difference=-7.2, SE=2.85; effect size=0.65), but not at day 25 (least-square mean difference=-4.5, SE=3.14; effect size=0.35). Significantly greater improvement was also observed in the esketamine group on the MADRS suicidal thoughts item score at 4 hours (effect size=0.67), but not at 24 hours (effect size=0.35) or at day 25 (effect size=0.29). Between-group reductions in clinician global judgment of suicide risk scores were not statistically different at any time point. The most common adverse events among participants in the esketamine group were nausea, dizziness, dissociation, unpleasant taste, and headache. CONCLUSIONS: These preliminary findings indicate that intranasal esketamine compared with placebo, given in addition to comprehensive standard-of-care treatment, may result in significantly rapid improvement in depressive symptoms, including some measures of suicidal ideation, among depressed patients at imminent risk for suicide.","0"
"4064","Human psychopharmacology and dose-effects of salvinorin A, a kappa opioid agonist hallucinogen present in the plant Salvia divinorum.^\nSalvinorin A is a potent, selective nonnitrogenous kappa opioid agonist and the known psychoactive constituent of Salvia divinorum, a member of the mint family that has been used for centuries by Mazatec shamans of Mexico for divination and spiritual healing. S. divinorum has over the last several years gained increased popularity as a recreational drug. This is a double-blind, placebo controlled study of salvinorin A in 4 psychologically and physically healthy hallucinogen-using adults. Across sessions, participants inhaled 16 ascending doses of salvinorin A and 4 intermixed placebo doses under comfortable and supportive conditions. Doses ranged from 0.375 μg/kg to 21 μg/kg. Subject-rated drug strength was assessed every 2 min for 60 min after inhalation. Orderly time- and dose-related effects were observed. Drug strength ratings peaked at 2 min (first time point) and definite subjective effects were no longer present at approximately 20 min after inhalation. Dose-related increases were observed on questionnaire measures of mystical-type experience (Mysticism Scale) and subjective effects associated with classic serotonergic (5-HT2(A)) hallucinogens (Hallucinogen Rating Scale). Salvinorin A did not significantly increase heart rate or blood pressure. Participant narratives indicated intense experiences characterized by disruptions in vestibular and interoceptive signals (e.g., change in spatial orientation, pressure on the body) and unusual and sometimes recurring themes across sessions such as revisiting childhood memories, cartoon-like imagery, and contact with entities. Under these prepared and supportive conditions, salvinorin A occasioned a unique profile of subjective effects having similarities to classic hallucinogens, including mystical-type effects.","4"
"5812","Ecstasy (MDMA): Are the psychological problems associated with its use reversed by prolonged abstinence?.^\nRationale: Chronic, regular recreational use of ecstasy (MDMA) is associated with psychopathology, elevated behavioural impulsivity and persistent impairment of memory performance. Objective: The aim of the present study was to investigate which of these sequelae persist after at least 6 months of abstinence from ecstasy.Methods: Four groups of participants were compared: 18 current regular recreational ecstasy users, 15 ex-regular ecstasy users who had abstained from using the drug for an average of 2 years, 16 polydrug users who had never taken ecstasy and 15 drug-naive controls. Results: There were no significant group differences in age, education level, or pre-morbid intelligence and, generally, the use of illicit drugs other than ecstasy was not significantly different among the three drug-using groups. Both current and ex-ecstasy users exhibited elevated psychopathology and behavioural impulsivity compared with polydrug users and drug-naive controls, but current ecstasy users exhibited a broader range of psychopathology than ex-users. Both groups of ecstasy users also exhibited impaired working memory and verbal recall performance compared with drug-naive controls, but only ex-users exhibited impaired verbal recall relative to polydrug users. Regression analysis indicated that psychopathology was primarily predicted by the extent of previous consumption of cannabis rather than ecstasy, whereas the majority of the cognitive deficits were only predicted by the extent of previous ecstasy use. Conclusions: Selective impairments of neuro-psychological performance associated with regular ecstasy use are not reversed by prolonged abstinence. This is consistent with evidence that ecstasy has potent and selective neurotoxic effects on brain serotonergic systems in humans.","0"
"863","Multiple drug ingestion by ecstasy abusers in the United States.^\nThe abuse of ecstasy-type drugs such as 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) and 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA) is generally associated with young adults attending ""Rave"" parties. Little toxicological information has been reported regarding ecstasy usage by individuals undergoing monitoring in other settings in the United States. The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence and patterns of licit and illicit drugs in urine specimens of ecstasy users. A survey of laboratory data over the years 2005-2007 revealed that 198 urine specimens were confirmed positive (cutoff concentration 100 ng/mL) for MDMA and/or MDA from the following types of donors (# positive specimens): Correctional (159); Sports (19); Workplace (9); Pain Patients (8); and Special Test Requests (3). Of these, 122 (61.6%) were positive for MDMA and MDA, 70 (35.4%) were positive for MDMA, and 6 (3.0%) were positive for MDA. A majority (84.3%) of the specimens contained multiple drugs and/or metabolites in addition to MDMA and MDA. The median number of drugs/metabolites reported for these ecstasy users was 5 (range, 1-9). In addition to MDMA/MDA, the most commonly identified drug groups (%) were cannabis (THCCOOH) (61.6%); amphetamine/ methamphetamine (38.4%); benzoylecgonine (30.8%); diazepam-related (9.6%); opiates (7.1%); alprazolam (5.6%); and others (5.6%). Although multidrug ingestion appears to be common amongst ecstasy users, caution is recommended in interpretation. Illicit ecstasy in the United States and Canada frequently contains methamphetamine and other active substances, and multidrug use may not have been intentional.","0"
"7097","An exploration of actigraphy in the context of ketamine and treatment‐resistant depression.^\nObjectives This study explored the potential of non‐parametric and complexity analysis metrics to detect changes in activity post‐ketamine and their association with depressive symptomatology. Methods Individuals with treatment‐resistant depression (TRD: n = 27, 16F, 35.9 ± 10.8 years) and healthy volunteers (HVs: n = 9, 4F, 36.4 ± 9.59 years) had their activity monitored during an inpatient, double‐blind, crossover study where they received an infusion of ketamine or saline placebo. All participants were 18–65 years old, medication‐free, and had a MADRS score ≥20. Non‐parametric metrics averaged over each study day, metrics derived from complexity analysis, and traditionally calculated non‐parametric metrics averaged over two weeks were calculated from the actigraphy time series. A separate analysis was conducted for a subsample (n = 17) to assess the utility of these metrics in a hospital setting. Results In HVs, lower intradaily variability was observed within daily rest/activity patterns post‐ketamine versus post‐placebo (F = 5.16(1,15), p = 0.04). No other significant effects of drug or drug‐by‐time or correlations between depressive symptomatology and activity were detected.

"6952","Stereochemical analysis of 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine and its main metabolites in human samples including the catechol-type metabolite (3,4-dihydroxymethamphetamine).^\n3,4-Methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA; ""ecstasy"") is a designer drug commonly misused in large segments of young populations. MDMA is usually formulated in tablets of its racemate (1:1 mixture of its enantiomers) in doses ranging from 50 to 200 mg. MDMA has an enantioselective metabolism, the (S)-enantiomer being metabolized faster than the (R)-enantiomer. Different pharmacologic properties have been attributed to each enantiomer. The carbon responsible for MDMA chirality is preserved along its metabolic disposition. An analytical method has been developed to determine MDMA enantiomers and those from its major metabolites, 3,4-methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA), 3,4-dihydroxymeth-amphetamine (HHMA), and 4-hydroxy-3-methoxymethamphet-amine (HMMA). It has been applied to the analysis of plasma and urine samples from healthy recreational users of MDMA who participated voluntarily in a clinical trial and received 100 mg (R,S)-MDMA. HCl orally. (R)/(S) ratios both in plasma (0-48 h) and urine (0-72 h) for MDMA and MDA were >1 and <1, respectively. Ratios corresponding to HHMA and HMMA, close to unity, deviate from theoretical expectations and are most likely explained by the ability of MDMA to autoinhibit its own metabolism. The short elimination half-life of (S)-MDMA (4.8 h) is consistent with the subjective effects and psychomotor performance reported in subjects exposed to MDMA, whereas the much longer half-life of the (R)-enantiomer (14.8 h) correlates with mood and cognitive effects experienced on the next days after MDMA use.","4"

Methods: Participants (n = 321) completed a set of online surveys at 2 time points: 7 days before, and 1 day after a planned experience with a serotonergic psychedelic. The collected data included demographics, environmental factors (so-called setting) and five validated questionnaires: Mystical Experience Questionnaire (MEQ), visual subscales of Altered States of Consciousness Questionnaire (ASC-Vis), Challenging Experience Questionnaire (CEQ), Ego Dissolution Inventory (EDI) and Emotional Breakthrough Inventory (EBI). Participants were grouped according to whether they had reported using no cannabis (n = 195) or low (n = 53), medium (n = 45) or high (n = 28) dose, directly concomitant with the psychedelic. Multivariate analysis of covariance (MANCOVA) and contrasts was used to analyse differences in subjective effects between groups while controlling for potential confounding contextual ‘setting’ variables. Results: The simultaneous use of cannabis together with classic serotonergic psychedelics was associated with more intense psychedelic experience across a range of measures: a linear relationship was found between dose and MEQ, ASC-Vis and EDI scores, while a quadratic relationship was found for CEQ scores. No relationship was found between the dose of cannabis and the EBI. Conclusions: Results imply a possible interaction between the cannabis and psychedelic on acute subjective experiences; however, design limitations hamper our ability to draw firm inferences on directions of causality and the clinical implications of any such interactions.

"6282","Efficacy, Safety, and Tolerability of Two Administrations of COMP360 in Participants With TRD.^\nThis is a phase III, international, multi‐centre, randomised, parallel group, fixed repeat dose, double‐blind, controlled study. The study population will include participants aged ≥18 years with TRD. Overall, 568 participants are to be randomised in a 2:1:1 ratio to receive COMP360 25 mg, 10 mg or 1 mg. The study will last up to 16 weeks including a three‐ to ten‐week Screening Period and six‐week follow‐up from investigational product (IP) administration. In this study, the aim is to assess the efficacy of COMP360, administered with psychological support in adult participants with TRD, in improving symptoms of depression.","0"
"4326","LSD use in the United States: Trends, correlates, and a typology of us.^\nBackground: Recent years have witnessed an increased interest in LSD. This study investigates current information on the trends and correlates of LSD use from years 2002–2018 and seeks to develop an initial typology of use and misuse. Methods: Data is taken from the NSDUH (National Survey on Drug Use and Health) collected between 2002 and 2018 and trends and correlates of LSD use were analyzed with a survey adjusted logistic regression. Results: Our findings indicate that LSD use has increased 200 % over the study period (.23 % 2002−2005 to .72 % 2015−2018, AOR = 1.10, 95 % CI = 1.08, 1.12). Our findings also indicate several correlates of LSD use including higher levels of education (college degrees: AOR = 1.62, 95 % CI = 1.23, 2.13), not being married (divorced or separated, AOR = 2.31, 95 % CI = 1.44, 3.73, and have never been married, AOR = 5.67, f 95 % CI = 4.09, 7.86), as well as higher levels of antisocial behavior (having been arrested AOR = 3.20, 95 % CI = 2.50, 4.09) and comorbid mental health and substance abuse disorders (serious psychological distress, AOR = 2.39, 95 % CI = 2.05, 2.80). Further, four distinct subclasses were also discovered within LSD users and two of these subtypes of LSD users contained comorbid mental health disturbances and heavy involvement in the criminal justice system. Conclusion: LSD use has been on the rise within the last decades, particularly among those who are well educated. Two subclasses of LSD use (those with severe comorbid mental health disorders and those with criminal justice involvement) may require further interventions.","4"
"5997","Comparison of the effect of low dose ketamine plus dexmedetomidine vs low dose ketamine plus midazolam on hemodynamic changes and pain in electroconvulsive therapy.^\nBackground: Currently, electroconvulsive therapy (ECT) is used as an effective treatment method in many psychiatric disorders. The basis of a successful electroshock session is to create a seizure with the precise intensity, quality and duration. In addition to the appropriate method of shock induction, appropriate anesthesia methods should be used to cause such seizures. The present study compared a combination of low-dose ketamine and dexmedetomidine (Ketodex) with a combination of low-dose ketamine and midazolam (Ketomid) on hemodynamic changes in electroshocks applied to patients referred from the psychiatric ward. Methodology: This study was a randomized triple-blind clinical trial performed after obtaining permission from the Medical Ethics Committee of the Isfahan University of Medical Sciences. For this purpose, 70 patients were selected for electroshock therapy and randomly distributed into two groups of 35 people. In the first group, 0.04 mg/kg midazolam was combined with ketamine 0.1 mg/kg and in the second group, 0.5 μg/kg dexmedetomidine with 0.1 mg/kg ketamine. The patients were placed under complete cardiovascular monitoring. Hemodynamic changes of patients were measured and recorded before injection, after injection, after shock, and at 5 and 10 min after the end of seizures. Results: In this study, 70 patients who were candidates for receiving ECT were equally divided into two groups of 35: one group received a mixture of Ketodex and the second group a combination of Ketomid. The two study groups showed no significant difference in terms of systolic pressure (P = 0.883), diastolic (P = 0.443), mean arterial pressure (P = 0.443), oxygen saturation (P = 0.018), and heart rate (P = 0.286). Complications such as headache, muscular pain (P = 0.01), bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups. Conclusion: Our study showed that although systolic, diastolic and mean arterial blood pressure, heart rate and oxygen saturation were significantly reduced in both study groups, no significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of hemodynamic changes and neither drug group in our study population was different from the other in terms of these parameters. In addition, neither option was superior to the other. However, due to the fact that complications such as headache, muscular pain, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting were reported in the dexmedetomidine and ketamine groups, the combination of midazolam and ketamine appeared to be a more appropriate combination in patients undergoing electroconvulsive therapy.","0"
